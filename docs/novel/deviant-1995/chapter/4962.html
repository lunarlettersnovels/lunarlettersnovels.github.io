            <p><strong>Chapter 75.2</strong></p>
<p>D!-mn it.</p>
<p>With a short sigh, André looked down to hide his expression and dropped his hand from her face.</p>
<p>He didn’t intend to push her so hard that she would be scared. However, he couldn’t accept the idea of her staying here either.</p>
<p>As soon as André turned away from her, Miran gasped and urgently grabbed his arm. Then she desperately nodded her head.</p>
<p>“I’ll go!”</p>
<p>It seemed she had misunderstood something. Did she think he was going to just leave like this?</p>
<p>If she didn’t want to move into his apartment, he was prepared to book a hotel nearby for her. After that, if necessary, he could help her find a small apartment in the building where he lived.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, in the end, it was going to turn out the way he wanted, so it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>André smiled faintly and kissed her forehead.</p>
<p>“Just pack the essentials for now. We can have someone move the rest later.”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>An elderly chauffeur stood by the car, and as André and Miran emerged, he quickly opened the back door for them. The sedan, unlike anything she had seen in Korea, was large and elongated. A classic-shaped silver emblem resembling a person about to spread its wings and fly was prominently displayed at the tip of the hood.</p>
<p>As the car smoothly pulled away with them inside, Miran stole glances at André’s profile, which resembled a marble sculpture.</p>
<p>“Where is the apartment?”</p>
<p>“Columbus Circle.”</p>
<p>It was a name she felt she had heard before. She rummaged through her canvas bag to pull out a guidebook. In the dim light of the car, she relied on the glow from the streetlights outside to skim through the table of contents, and André reached over to turn on the backseat interior light.</p>
<p>When Miran smiled brightly, he let his arm drop and wrapped it around her shoulders. Leaning against André’s shoulder, she hummed a tune while flipping through the guidebook.</p>
<p>“Where have I seen this before…?”</p>
<p>She soon opened the guidebook to a specific page.</p>
<p>“Here it is! A circular plaza located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, adjacent to the southwest entrance of Central Park, featuring a statue of Christopher Columbus…”</p>
<p>Miran pointed to the photo with her finger.</p>
<p>“Aha, it’s like a rotary. No wonder it looks familiar; I think I’ve seen it in a lot of movies set in New York. André, look at this statue. Isn’t it amazing?”</p>
<p>“Mhm.”</p>
<p>While André casually responded to Miran’s chatter, he twirled her silky hair around his finger. His plan for after work, which he had set this morning, was to check on Charles and then return to the office to tackle the mountain of paperwork waiting for him. However, he had already given up on that plan long ago.</p>
<p>Just a few hours ago, when they were in the same car heading to the Lafayette Residence, he had felt terrible, but now both his body and mind felt light.</p>
<p>André pressed his lips against her temple. As she chatted away, looking at the guidebook, even the meaningless chatter was welcome.</p>
<p>He smiled wryly.</p>
<p>‘Is she like a living, breathing tranquilizer?’</p>
<p>Thinking that made him want to hold onto her even more. He faced the dilemma of where to fit this beautiful and unique puzzle piece into the tightly woven fabric of his life. But that wasn’t an urgent matter, so he pushed it to the back of his mind for now.</p>
<p>In fact, aside from wanting to keep Miran by his side, he had no concrete plans at all. She had just arrived and was planning to stay in New York for at least six months, so he could think about it after successfully getting through the shareholders’ meeting.</p>
<p>After putting off the decision, André let out a satisfied sigh and leaned comfortably against the back of his seat.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Miran stood with her nose pressed against the floor-to-ceiling windows of the 33rd-floor apartment, gazing in awe at the stunning night view of Central Park and Columbus Circle.</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>She was speechless at the fantastic cityscape that looked like it belonged on a tourist postcard.</p>
<p>André’s apartment had a completely different atmosphere from the classic Lafayette Residence. The monochromatic, simple, and modern interior appeared a bit cold, but it suited him well.</p>
<p>André relaxed on the sofa, gazing languidly at Miran as she excitedly darted around like a puppy, exclaiming in admiration at the sights.</p>
<p>She bent down to examine the modern art sculpture placed on the console. André’s gaze was fixed on her back. His eyes traveled up her long, slender legs to her sensuous curves at the hips, and the bare skin of her waist that was teasingly revealed stirred a strange thirst within him.</p>
<p>There were no servants here to knock and interrupt him.</p>
<p>“Miran-ah.”</p>
<p>She visibly flinched at the sound of his voice and slowly straightened up. André’s voice had deepened.</p>
<p>“Come here.”</p>
