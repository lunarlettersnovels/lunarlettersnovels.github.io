            <p><strong>Chapter 21.2</strong></p>
<p>André’s response was as firm as driving a wedge with a massive hammer. Miran’s heart fluttered wildly, rising to her throat.</p>
<p>‘Oh no. He really means to do it.’</p>
<p>Miran’s eyes wavered intensely before she suddenly whimpered and pushed against André’s chest. When he obediently lifted his upper body, she slipped out and stood on the floor as if fleeing.</p>
<p>André’s gaze lingered on Miran’s retreating figure. Her rounded, firm bu!ttocks swayed seductively atop her slender legs. Her narrow waist and lithe back were adorned with cascading brown hair that flowed like a waterfall. Stumbling slightly, she bent over to pick up her handbag from the table.</p>
<p>André rubbed his forehead and let out a short sigh. His p3n!s throbbed painfully. However, unlike Park Doosik, André de Lafayette had no interest in forcing himself on a woman who said no.</p>
<p>As André stepped off the bed and picked up the shirt he had tossed aside, Miran suddenly stood before him again.</p>
<p>With one arm b@r3ly covering her chest, Miran suddenly thrust her fist towards André. Then, she slowly turned her fist over and opened her palm. The square silver foil packet had nothing written on it, but any adult man would know what it was.</p>
<p>André let out a faint chuckle, his lips curling slightly.</p>
<p>You carried this in your handbag? Impressive foresight, but—</p>
<p>“It’s too small.”</p>
<p>Miran’s eyes widened in surprise, her mouth opening and closing wordlessly.</p>
<p>“What? How can you just assume…”</p>
<p>“It’s a c0ndo!m.”</p>
<p>She tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>“How can you tell if it’s too big or too small without even looking?”</p>
<p>“What’s the size?”</p>
<p>“…What do you mean size? It’s not clothing. Doesn’t a c0ndo!m stretch like a balloon?”</p>
<p>Miran looked up at André with a skeptical gaze.</p>
<p>‘Does he look like someone who doesn’t want to use a c0ndo!m?’</p>
<p>With a snort, André took the c0ndo!m from Miran’s palm. He rubbed the surface with his thumb, feeling the rolled edge. It was only big enough for two fingers to fit inside.</p>
<p>Expecting him to use this was either a way to cut off circulation and cause his p3n!s to necrotize, or it was intended as torture. With a light flick of his fingers, the spinning packet landed back in her palm.</p>
<p>“Open it.”</p>
<p>Miran blinked a couple of times at him, curiosity filling her eyes. Absentmindedly lowering the arm that had been covering her chest, she tore open the c0ndo!m packet. She then took out the rolled-up c0ndo!m and examined it curiously, turning it this way and that. She unrolled the rim, stretching it out.</p>
<p>André chuckled softly as he watched. She didn’t even know how to use a c0ndo!m, yet she had the foresight to carry one.</p>
<p>“…. So this is what it looks like.”</p>
<p>Miran mumbled as she stretched the c0ndo!m sideways and lengthwise. Then, she dangled the flattened, stretched c0ndo!m in front of André.</p>
<p>“This… It’s made of rubber, so it should stretch quite a bit. Even if it’s a bit tight, can’t we make it work? An older friend of mine went through a lot of trouble to get this extension.”</p>
<p>André’s eyebrows shot up.</p>
<p>“Extension?”</p>
<p>It seemed that the “extension” she had brought for a perfect crime was this c0ndo!m. Thinking back on how he had seriously pondered Miran’s true intentions the entire way here, André found it absurd. Suddenly, an uncomfortable question popped into his mind.</p>
<p>‘If I hadn’t sat next to her, would she have used that c0ndo!m with another man tonight?’</p>
<p>It wasn’t a pleasant thought. However, there was no need, right, or reason to feel upset over something that hadn’t happened with a one-night stand.</p>
<p>Anyway, he needed to let this naive woman know that the c0ndo!m wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>“Hand.”</p>
<p>Distracted by the c0ndo!m, Miran looked up abruptly and extended her hand with a puzzled expression. André grabbed her wrist and pulled it down. Then, he guided her hand to his p3n!s, which was straining against his pants at an angle.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>As Miran struggled to pull her wrist away, André covered her hand with his own.</p>
<p>With an irresistible force, he pressed her hand firmly against his p3n!s, slowly guiding it from the base to the shaft. Miran’s eyes widened in shock at the size she felt in her palm.</p>
<p>“Gosh, this can’t be real…”</p>
