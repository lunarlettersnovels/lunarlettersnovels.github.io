            <h3>Chapter 31.1</h3>
<p>The entrance, which had been gently relaxed, suddenly clamped shut like a clam at the unexpected intrusion. The narrow !nner wΔlls gripped and pushed back against the inserted finger with intense pressure. Miran trembled all over, her nails digging into the back of André’s clasped hand, but she did not reject him. When told to endure, it seemed she truly intended to endure.</p>
<p>André vigorously rubbed her cl!t()r!s with his tongue while pushing his finger in slightly.</p>
<p>“Hmmph!”</p>
<p>A m@an mixed with a sob and her breathless panting filled the air. The inner flesh tightened around his finger as if to crush it, and her legs, from her toes to her thighs, tensed up, shaking on his shoulders.</p>
<p>André curved his finger slightly and gently rubbed the inside of her pubic bone. It felt as if his finger might melt inside the hot, sl!ck walls.</p>
<p>He parted his lips and vigorously sucked on her cl!t-ris while swirling his tongue around it. The sound of wet flesh rubbing together was audible. The steady stream of juices pooled in André’s palm. He swallowed the mixture of her fluids and his saliva.</p>
<p>Before long, Miran’s toes curled tightly. Her entire body convulsed as if she were springing up.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>Miran’s climax poured down onto his lips as she twisted her waist and thrashed about. Her legs, tense with strength, stretched out above his shoulders as if to pierce the air. The !nner w⋀lls repeated strong contractions and short relaxations, making his finger numb. Blood oozed from the nail marks on the back of her hand, which she grasped like a lifeline.</p>
<p>As the convulsions between her legs subsided, he slowly withdrew his finger from the entrance and removed his lips from her v@g!na. Miran, now limp, curled up on the table, trembling and sobbing.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t be laughing at this sight.”</p>
<p>André covered his satisfied, upturned lips with the back of his hand, wiping them clean.</p>
<p>It wasn’t bad for a first try. No, it would be more accurate to say that he enjoyed it unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Miran was thoroughly wet and responded extremely sensitively to his lips and touch. Overwhelmed by the unfamiliar heat, she lay there with her mouth agape, breathing heavily, and gazing up at him with wet, lµstful eyes that were excessively s*nsual.</p>
<p>He reacted like a beast, unbuckling his pants and pulling down the zipper. He wanted to thrust deep into her throat, those lips that had been sweetly sucking on something. But if he did that, this innocent woman might cry herself into a faint.</p>
<p>“Your pretty lips might get torn.”</p>
<p>André gazed down at Miran’s lips, then pulled down his briefs. His p€n!s, hard as a rock, sprang up with a “thud” like a spring, but couldn’t withstand its own weight and drooped.</p>
<p>He wrapped his hand, slick with her fluids, around the shaft of his p€n!s and moved it up and down a couple of times. The veins bulged as his p€n!s became coated with the glistening fluid.</p>
<p>His half-lidded eyes roamed freely over Miran’s body.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>He tilted his chin up slightly. With a squelching sound, the noise of flesh slapping together echoed. Miran, who had been sprawled on the table, flinched and sniffled as she lifted her head. Her eyes, still wet with tear stains, widened. Her eyelashes, heavy and clumped from the tears, fluttered rapidly.</p>
<p>Miran groggily sat up. She licked her dry lips with a red tongue and looked at his lower body with a dazed expression. André hesitated and removed his hand. As she stared blankly, his fully engorged p€n!s throbbed and grew, rising up to his navel.</p>
<p>“Haa! This can’t be real…”</p>
<p>Miran covered her mouth with her hand. Her large eyes, about to overflow, glanced at André’s face and then back down.</p>
<p>Wonder, curiosity, fear. Her transparent eyes mirrored her emotions like a mirror.</p>
<p>André faintly lifted the corners of his mouth and seductively whispered in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Touch it.”</p>
<p>Miran half-extended her hand but hesitated, clenching her fist. He chuckled softly and pulled her hand towards him.</p>
<p>“I won’t bite.”</p>
<p>As her fingers touched his p€n!s, Miran inhaled sharply and, watching his reaction, cautiously wrapped her hand around the thick shaft. Then, just as he had done, she slowly stroked it up and down.</p>
<p>Unlike his calloused hands from exercise and training, her slender and soft fingers brushed from the base to the gl@ns, almost tickling. Normally, such a teasing touch wouldn’t bring him to climax even if it lasted all night, but suddenly, he felt the urge to release.</p>
