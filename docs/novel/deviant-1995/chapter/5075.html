            <p><strong>Chapter 19.1</strong></p>
<p>As soon as her perfectly shaped br3asts, like those from an anatomy textbook, were revealed, Miran quickly covered them with her arms. Watching her shiver, André exhaled a hot breath towards the ceiling.</p>
<p>If he were still a soldier and Miran were a spy from an enemy country, he felt he might divulge all his nation’s secrets just to see her br3asts again.</p>
<p>At that moment, he remembered the purpose of this exercise. Checking the script, André roughly pulled Miran’s arms away. Before she could raise them again, he grabbed her bre@sts.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>She hunched her back and shrugged her shoulders, grasping his wrists as if to remove his hands. The line between acting and reality blurred.</p>
<p>André clenched his teeth at the feel of her soft, supple skin and the firm fullness in his palms. The contrast between his large, sun-tanned hands and her pale, as if it had never seen sunlight, was strikingly violent. This made it all the more provocative.</p>
<p>Ignoring his brain’s command to stop, his thumb brushed over the small, tender p3ak, still like an unripe fruit.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Miran flinched and wavered. André’s breathing became noticeably heavier. He unbuttoned another button of his shirt, which felt particularly constricting. This d@mn script practice, bordering on po!rn0graphy, was creating new s3xua! inclinations in him.</p>
<p>He tried to recall if he had ever been this ar*used before, but no one came to mind except the woman in front of him.</p>
<p>His greedy gaze alternated between the trembling Miran and the script. When he removed his hand from her chest, a sigh of relief escaped her lips. André then mischievously smirked and pulled her to her feet. Before she could push him away in surprise, he wrapped his arms around her waist and buried his face in her chest.</p>
<p>“Wait, hold on!”</p>
<p>André rubbed his sharp nose between her cleavage, exhaling warm breaths. His lips climbed the soft mound and enveloped the now even more pronounced pink p3ak.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Trembling and tilting her chin up, Miran placed her hand on André’s head, which was pressed against her chest. Knowing he was acting according to the script, she neither pushed him away nor pulled him closer.</p>
<p>Her fingers threaded through his hair, sending a shiver down his spine as they scratched his scalp. Goosebumps rose on the back of his neck.</p>
<p>The sensation of her saliva-slicked chest clinging to his lips was maddeningly sweet. André mustered all his remaining self-control to avoid biting or rubbing his tongue against the tender flesh. If he used his tongue, this would no longer be just practice.</p>
<p>Summoning all his willpower, André tore his lips away from Miran’s chest and swallowed the saliva that had accumulated in his mouth. Miran’s knees buckled, and she stumbled, her mind still dazed. Her heaving chest seemed to beckon him, as if calling him back.</p>
<p>André firmly grasped Miran’s waist, supporting her. Then, he slid his hand between her thighs.</p>
<p>“No, stop!”</p>
<p>Miran cried out in shock, trying to push her hips back, but her waist was trapped by his grip. André had only intended to pretend to touch her panties with the palm of his hand, but as she tensed her thighs and struggled, his hand became stuck between her legs.</p>
<p>André gritted his teeth as he felt the slippery moisture seeping through the white lace panties. As Miran desperately pushed his chest and twisted her waist, his palm inadvertently rubbed against her thighs. Miran collapsed onto his shoulder, letting out a horrifically er0tic m*an.</p>
<p>Was this realistic acting, or was it Miran’s genuine reaction?</p>
<p>His mind, on the verge of losing its objectivity, could no longer make a clear judgment. As if trying to clear his head, he shook his head once and summoned superhuman willpower to remove his hand from her.</p>
<p>At the same time, Miran collapsed to the ground. Just as she was about to fall, André caught her and laid her down on the table.</p>
<p>There was a line in the script that mentioned a “breathtaking view.”</p>
<p>Her wavy brown hair scattered over her slender back, cascading over her shoulders and revealing her white nape. His gaze roved over the taut silhouette encased in lace panties.</p>
