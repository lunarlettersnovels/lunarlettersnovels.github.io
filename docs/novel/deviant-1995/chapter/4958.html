            <p><strong>Chapter 77.2</strong></p>
<p>Miran felt like she was going to let out animalistic m0a,ns from the new pleasure she felt. Teetering on the edge of ecstasy, the sensation was both ecstatic and agonizing.</p>
<p>“Ahngh! André, don’t touch there, hngh!”</p>
<p>Miran tried to push his arm away, but he didn’t budge and instead slipped another finger inside.</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>His two curled fingers slowly rubbed the folds of the inner wall near her pubic bone. She trembled and covered her mouth. m0a,ns leaked through her fingers.</p>
<p>“Ahngh, there, don’t!”</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>He quickly rubbed her protruding clit. Miran let out a sob, flailing her arms as if to escape, scratching at the glass wall.</p>
<p>“Or… both?”</p>
<p>As André stimulated both spots simultaneously with a few flicks of his wrist, Miran let out a deep m0a,n and collapsed.</p>
<p>“Aah, ha-hngh!”</p>
<p>André quickly extended a hand to catch her before her head hit the glass wall. Her body twitched and convulsed with his hand between her thighs. As her legs gave out, he pulled her up just in time to keep her from collapsing.</p>
<p>André chuckled softly, his voice hoarse.</p>
<p>“This is too dangerous here. Let’s get out.”</p>
<p>He held her limp body, roughly rinsing off the soap suds, then carried her out in one arm. Grabbing a large bathrobe from the closet, he wrapped her in it and carried her from the bathroom before setting her down on the bed.</p>
<p>It would be a lie to say he hadn’t m@st.urb!ted imagining Miran on his bed. Whether he thought of her because he was m@st.urb!t1ng, or m@st.urb!ted because he thought of her, the order wasn’t clear.</p>
<p>Seeing her lying on the dark navy sheets, wet and na.k3d, gazing up at him, his lower body tensed as if he might climax any second. Then, he remembered something important.</p>
<p>“…I don’t have a c0!nd.m.”</p>
<p>André touched his forehead in frustration. Miran mumbled in a voice as faint as a mosquito’s hum.</p>
<p>“I’m on the pill.”</p>
<p>Her departure date had coincided with her period. Her friend Jieun advised taking the pill to avoid the strain of a long flight, jet lag, and menstruation all at once, so she started a few days before leaving. Just in case, she’d secretly stashed three months’ worth without her sister Juran knowing.</p>
<p>“André, hurry and hold me.”</p>
<p>Miran reached out to him. André immediately climbed over her and covered her with his large frame. She slowly spread her legs, wrapping them around his waist and slightly squeezing with her thighs.</p>
<p>André snapped his head up and stared down at her. Miran, cheeks flushed, averted her eyes, then glanced up briefly.</p>
<p>In her gaze, André saw pure, honest desire. It was as if an earthquake had shaken his insides, jumbling his organs. His entire body blazed. The lingering moisture on his skin dried up under his heat.</p>
<p>Holding back was no longer possible. André positioned himself at her entrance and slowly pushed forward. Despite her wetness and the f0r3p!ay in the bathroom, she was as tense as their first time, her inner walls clenched his tip tightly and refusing to let go.</p>
<p>“Hnng!”</p>
<p>Miran paled and bit her lower lip hard.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>“A little.”</p>
<p>André pulled out and kissed her lips softly. He kneaded her br3.asts, rolling her nipples, and gently rubbed his p3n.s between her legs. Gradually, the tension in her body eased.</p>
<p>Then he entered again. The tip barely entered before she grimaced, her body trembling.</p>
<p>“Hnn… Did it get bigger since I last saw it?”</p>
<p>André, who’d been catching his breath while burying his forehead against her neck, paused for a moment, then rolled over, pulling her on top of him. She lay sprawled over his body.</p>
<p>“You put it in. Only as much as it doesn’t hurt.”</p>
<p>“M-me?”</p>
<p>Flustered, Miran half-raised her upper body. As her hips sank, his c*c!k slipped in a bit further.</p>
<p>“Ungh.”</p>
<p>Miran instinctively lifted her hips slightly. His tip nearly slipped out, barely caught at her entrance.</p>
<p>“I’ll help, so try.”</p>
<p>André gripped her pelvis and pulled her down. Miran hurriedly grabbed his hands.</p>
<p>“I-I’ll do it!”</p>
<p>Her chest heaved as she caught her breath. As she steadied her breathing, her thighs trembled and slowly lowered her hips.</p>
