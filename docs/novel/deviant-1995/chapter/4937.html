            <p><strong>Chapter 88.1</strong></p>
<p>Seunghyuk let out a short sigh.</p>
<p>“I can tell without you saying it. I should’ve warned you harder back then. It’s been eating at me. What did that perverted bastard do this time?”</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, Miran recounted what happened on the set of A Gangster’s Innocence. Seunghyuk grimaced and shook his head.</p>
<p>“That crazy bastard. He’ll get what’s coming to him one day if he keeps acting like that. Scum like him is why the Korean film industry is in such a pathetic mess.”</p>
<p>Miran continued calmly.</p>
<p>“That’s why I decided to quit acting. As you know, I’m not very talented, and my looks stand out too much.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk leaned back and crossed his arms. He tilted his head as if he was seeing her for the first time, then spoke.</p>
<p>“Why should you quit? If anything, there are others who ought to quit. Acting improves with practice, and distinctive looks are an asset for an actor. Plus, you have… how do I put it? Something that draws people in. What they call ‘star quality.’ That’s not something you can train for. You’re born with it.”</p>
<p>Miran blinked, surprised by the unexpected praise.</p>
<p><em>I have something like that? No one had ever said that to me before.</em></p>
<p>Giving up acting wasn’t easy. She hadn’t admitted it, but after draining her sister’s savings for a four-year theater and film degree, all that money felt wasted. In the end, she felt like a failure and her confidence hit rock bottom.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what to do with her life, and she often cried quietly at night. So when a stewardess academy flyer landed in her hands by chance, that gave her a new goal and she felt lucky to find it.</p>
<p>Miran smiled shyly and bowed her head towards Seunghyuk.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I wish you’d told me sooner. I’ve already decided to try something else.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Flight attendant. That’s why I came to New York to learn English.”</p>
<p>“… Well, d@,mn. I was a step too late,”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk ruffled his hair, seemingly embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Why? Too late for what?”</p>
<p>“Actually, I was going to ask you for a favor.”</p>
<p>“…What kind of favor? If it’s something I can do, of course I will do it.”</p>
<p>Miran answered cheerfully with a bright smile.</p>
<p>Then Seunghyuk rummaged through his bag and held something out to her.</p>
<p>“Oh! Is that…?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“A script.”</p>
<p>The cover read “Flushing Video” in English, with the Korean subtitle “Huladong Video Store”.</p>
<p>“What’s Huladong?”</p>
<p>“The biggest Koreatown in New York is in Flushing, Queens. Korean locals add ‘dong’ to the end of Flushing and call it ‘Huladong’.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk briefly explained the film to Miran.</p>
<p>Flushing Video was a short film he wrote and financed himself, and he was about halfway through filming. He was aiming to submit it to the Sundance Film Festival.</p>
<p>“The story is about the coming-of-age of a Korean-American boy named Jin. He struggles with English, academics, and sports, so he gets beaten and bullied at school. Then, by chance, he ends up working at a video rental store called ‘Flushing Video.’”</p>
<p>Miran listened quietly.</p>
<p>“There, he devoured everything he could get his hands on, from American films, European art films, and even videotaped Korean dramas and entertainment programs. That’s how Jin, who dreamed of becoming a film director, turned his autobiographical story into a successful film.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk wanted Miran to play the role of Michelle, the woman Jin had a long-time crush on.</p>
<p>“Michelle is a Korean-American girl who goes to the same school as Jin, but she’s a year ahead. She’s a regular at the Huladong video store. She’s his intense teenage unrequited crush. After he became a successful film director, Michelle became his eternal muse. The final scene of the film shows Michelle arriving to audition for Jin’s next project. It’s a small role but her presence is felt throughout the story.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk’s face darkened.</p>
<p>“But a few days ago, the friend who was supposed to play the role reached out and said they probably wouldn’t be able to make time because they’d just been cast in a fairly major Off-Broadway production.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear…”</p>
<p>If Miran still dreamed of acting, it would’ve been a tempting role. It felt bittersweet that the opportunity only came now.</p>
<p>Seunghyuk continued.</p>
<p>“I thought about cutting Michelle’s lines and giving the role to Hyunjung, haa… but that’d be a betrayal to the crew who trusted me.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk’s eyes were full of mischief as he chuckled quietly. Miran couldn’t help but laugh along.</p>
<p>“Then I suddenly thought of you. Honestly, when I saw you at the dorm, I was pretty shocked. Your face perfectly fit Michelle’s image that I’ve been picturing in my head way better than the friend I originally cast. I could vividly picture the mise-en-scène of Michelle’s appearance right before my eyes. First love, muse, heroine. Now, I can’t imagine anyone else playing that role but you.”</p>
