<p><strong>Chapter 22.2</strong></p>
<p>As he stared at her lips, André thought of various ways to enjoy her without a c0ndo!m. Then, he slowly lowered his head and captured her lips with his own.</p>
<p>With a single soft kiss, Miran melted, and André gently laid her back on the bed, covering her with his body. Once he made up his mind, there was no reason or time to hesitate. He boldly grasped her br3@st and lowered his head.</p>
<p>“Ah! W-wait a moment!”</p>
<p>Miran, who had suddenly found herself lying on the bed, lifted her head and gently pushed at André’s head, which was attached to her chest. She couldn’t push too hard for fear of having her br3@st bitten. André, slightly moving back, kept her br3@st in his mouth and looked up at her.</p>
<p>As he lifted his head a bit more, the peak that had been drawn in deeply like a mountain summit slipped out from his lips. Her chest, now released, settled and gently swayed into a rounded shape.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Wh?”</p>
<p>Answering as if annoyed, his eyes held a golden blaze as he extended his tongue. Without even waiting for a response, he flicked the tip of his tongue against her erect, reddened n!ppl3.</p>
<p>Miran shivered and hunched her shoulders. The hand that had been pushing against André’s head curled up, gripping his hair. Short strands slipped through her fingers.</p>
<p>“This… this feels too strange.”</p>
<p>“What does?”</p>
<p>Fixing his gaze on Miran, André flashed a mischievous look and then lightly tugged on her delicate n!ppl3 with his teeth.</p>
<p>“Ack!”</p>
<p>Miran’s body jolted in shock.</p>
<p>During practice, André had only mimicked sucking her br3@st with his lips wide open, but now his tongue moved wildly like a live fish. He rolled the sensitive peak with the tip of his tongue, licked it with his tongue, and sucked it in as if he were about to swallow it.</p>
<p>Each time, a thrilling sensation, like an electric shock, started from the tip of her br3@st and coursed through her entire body.</p>
<p>The fine hairs on her body stood on end, and goosebumps spread across her limbs. He sucked her br3@st so hard that his cheeks hollowed. The sharp sensation, like a fishing hook tugging at her lower abdomen, made her thighs spasm. Soon, something hot gushed out from between her legs, trickling down her buttocks.</p>
<p>Genuinely confused, Miran pushed harder against André’s head.</p>
<p>“Ah, it really feels strange…”</p>
<p>As Miran pleaded in a frightened voice, André moved his lips to her other br3@st and asked,</p>
<p>“So, what feels strange?”</p>
<p>When it came time to answer, she found she had no words. She had experienced having her br3@sts fondled, but she had never received such expl!c!t caresses. André lowered his head again, taking a large mouthful of her br3@st and sucking while rolling her n!ppl3 with his tongue.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Miran covered her mouth, trembling and arching her back. No one had ever told her that having her br3@sts licked and sucked would feel like this. Overwhelmed by the unfamiliar and intense sensations, Miran wavered between pleasure and fear.</p>
<p>As André moved over her, he pressed down on her thighs and rubbed his hard shaft, still hidden in his pants, against her p4nt!es.</p>
<p>The idea of s3x that existed in Miran’s mind was like a collection of fragmented 3ro.t!c scenes from movies. However, experiencing it firsthand—pressing b@re skin against a man so closely that she could smell his faint scent and feeling his heavy weight with her entire body—was an act of intimacy that made her shiver.</p>
<p>It required a level of connection and affection that could make them fall in love if they weren’t already.</p>
<p>“Ah, cold!”</p>
<p>Miran flinched as the metal belt buckle touched her heated skin. André immediately lifted his lips from her br3@st and straightened his upper body.</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>André’s rough voice, scraped from his vocal cords, issued a brief apology as he spread her thighs wide and knelt between them. He then removed his watch and placed it on the small bedside table.</p>
<p>In full view of Miran, André deliberately unfastened his belt buckle, pulling the long leather belt out and tossing it onto his shirt. As he unbuttoned his pants, Miran’s heart plummeted. The moment he grasped the zipper between his fingers, she squeezed her eyes shut.</p>
