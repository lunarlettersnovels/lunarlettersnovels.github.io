            <p><strong>Chapter 84.2</strong></p>
<p>Miran, who had zero interest in cars, tilted her head and indifferently glanced at the vehicle.</p>
<p>‘It looks like a squashed anteater. Is this car such a big deal?’</p>
<p>“Wow, so damn cool! Isn’t that the car with doors that open like wings?”</p>
<p>Hyunjung acted as if she knew.</p>
<p>‘A car with doors that open like wings?’</p>
<p>Miran had never heard of it before. But since everyone else seemed to know, she awkwardly played along.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s cool—Mother!”</p>
<p>She flinched as the driver’s door shot upward like it was soaring. She was even more surprised when she saw the person who stepped out.</p>
<p>“…André?”</p>
<p>Miran muttered under her breath. Hyunjung, who was standing beside her, pricked up her ears. She looked back and forth between Miran and the man, gasping in surprise before whispering,</p>
<p>“Is that guy your boyfriend, unnie?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Y-yeah.”</p>
<p>“Kyaa! What to do! What to do!”</p>
<p>Hyunjung stamped her feet.</p>
<p>“He came all the way from New York to pick you up, unnie? Wow, he must really love you, unnie. The two of you look so great together! And he doesn’t even seem that old as I thought!”</p>
<p>Hyunjung giggled and gave Miran a thumbs-up.</p>
<p>André closed the oddly opened car door and strode toward Miran. She was used to seeing him in sharp suits, so his casual outfit caught her off guard.</p>
<p>He wore light blue summer pants and a thin ivory knit, his usually neat hair slightly messy over his forehead. He definitely looked younger than when he wore suits.</p>
<p>As he approached, Miran, who had been staring, raised her head in surprise. Instead of a greeting, he leaned down for a light kiss, and took her bag.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>He held out his hand as she stood there dumbfounded.</p>
<p>When Miran took it, he opened the passenger door and helped her into the low car. Coming to her senses, she waved awkwardly at the three classmates staring with their mouths open.</p>
<p>“…. Please tell the coordinator I left early.”</p>
<p>The three nodded and waved back in unison.</p>
<p>The car’s trunk seemed to be in the front. André opened the small trunk under the hood, put Miran’s bag inside, and got into the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>Miran couldn’t hide her surprise and asked.</p>
<p>“André, did you drive all the way from New York to pick me up?”</p>
<p>“Put on your seatbelt.”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer her question and buckled her seatbelt himself.</p>
<p>The engine roared like a beast as he started the car.</p>
<p>It was louder than any Tiburon engine she’d heard, and she was scared for a moment.</p>
<p><em>Don’t a lot of people die in sports car accidents?</em></p>
<p>“…André?”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>The car was already speeding out of the hotel parking lot and onto the highway. The low car made it feel like the road was rushing at her face.</p>
<p>“This car’s really fast, right?”</p>
<p>“… something like that.”</p>
<p>As André shifted gears and stepped on the accelerator, the engine let out a ferocious roar, like something from a car racing movie.</p>
<p>Miran gripped her seatbelt with both hands and anxiously looked at him.</p>
<p>He sped down the highway with a faint smile on his lips, zigzagging past the car in front of him. She’d known he could be a bit impatient, but she didn’t expect him to enjoy speeding like this.</p>
<p>Miran cautiously spoke.</p>
<p>“Um, André? You know how James Dean, the actor, died in a sports car crash?”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“I want to live a long life.”</p>
<p>Silence filled the car for a moment.</p>
<p>André, eyes fixed on the road, blinked and suddenly laughed. He covered his mouth with his fist, cleared his throat, and slowly eased off the gas.</p>
<p>“Better?”</p>
<p>With a hint of a smile in his eyes, Andre jerked his chin. Miran checked that the car was now matching the speed of others around them, sighed in relief, and finally leaned back against her seat.</p>
<p>“Yeah, this is just right.”</p>
<p>Last night, she’d talked to Hyunjung before bed and then got a call from André. His voice asking “Are you okay?” sounded so affectionate that a sudden ache swept through her that she teared up a bit. She’d brushed it off as tiredness, but in reality, she missed him.</p>
<p>And now, he’d driven all this way to pick her up. It felt like receiving a surprise gift.</p>
<p>“Did he come all the way from New York to pick you up, unnie? Wow, he must really love you, unnie.”</p>
<p>Miran beamed when she remembered Hyunjung’s words and squirmed in her seat. She stole a glance at André’s side profile. Feeling her gaze, he gently smiled, reached out his hand that was holding the gear, and brushed her cheek with his knuckles.</p>
<p>Miran’s heart raced as fast as the sports car.</p>
<p>He didn’t say it out loud, but his actions spoke clearly.</p>
<p>So there was no reason to doubt André’s love.</p>
