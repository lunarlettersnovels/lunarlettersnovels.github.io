            <p><strong>Chapter 68.2</strong></p>
<p>Seunghyuk stood in front of an elegant limestone building, diagonally across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, scanning the area.</p>
<p>“997 Fifth Avenue… This is the place.”</p>
<p>Everything about the building exuded luxury, from the impeccably dressed doorman standing at the entrance to the rich, burgundy awning that stretched over the sidewalk, its side elegantly printed with the address in cursive script. It looked like something straight out of a classic New York film.</p>
<p>Miran tilted her head back and gazed up at the towering facade.</p>
<p>‘Andre lives in a place like this?’</p>
<p>Seunghyuk had the same question.</p>
<p>“So, you’re telling me that someone you know… lives in the penthouse of this building?”</p>
<p>Miran had vaguely described Andre as just someone she knew. She wasn’t sure what to call him. They weren’t dating, so boyfriend wasn’t the right word. But it also felt too embarrassing to flat-out say he was someone she liked.</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes, feeling a twinge of bitterness. She had a feeling all along—what she felt for Andre and what he felt for her weren’t exactly the same.</p>
<p>“He must be insanely rich. Fifth Avenue, right in front of Central Park, on Museum Mile… and in the penthouse, no less.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk had explained that the PH in the address stood for ‘penthouse’, meaning it was at the very top of the building.</p>
<p>Maybe he’s so rich that he doesn’t even care about getting back the $10,000.</p>
<p>That thought made Andre feel even more distant—like someone completely out of reach.</p>
<p>Miran answered hesitantly.</p>
<p>“He was, at least a few months ago… But some of my letters have been returned recently, so I think he might have moved.”</p>
<p>“You said you needed to return something to him, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. When he left for New York, he forgot something, so I’ve been holding onto it for him.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go inside and ask if he moved. Buildings like this usually have a front desk, like a hotel.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk suggested it so casually, as if it were no big deal.</p>
<p>“Do you think that’s okay? My English isn’t that great…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll handle it.”</p>
<p>“Really? Oh my gosh, thank you so much!”</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Seunghyuk approached the doorman and greeted him in a friendly manner. Miran admired his confidence and fluent English—he seemed so at ease, even outside of Korea. Feeling a little self-conscious, she trailed closely behind him. The doorman barely moved, only shifting his eyes to scan them up and down before silently pushing open the heavy entrance door.</p>
<p>“They let us in without even asking anything.”</p>
<p>Miran whispered, and Seunghyuk lowered his voice to reply.</p>
<p>“That’s what doormen do—they just open doors. The real security check happens over there.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, behind a sleek marble counter that resembled a hotel reception desk, a uniformed elderly man with white hair was watching them closely.</p>
<p>“Wow, this place is amazing. It looks like a movie set for <em>The Great Gatsby</em> or something.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk murmured as he took in the classic gilded decor and scattered artworks in the lobby. Just then, the stern-faced concierge addressed them.</p>
<p>[How may I help you?]</p>
<p>As Miran rummaged through her bag for the letter, Seunghyuk turned to her and asked,</p>
<p>“Miran, what’s the name of the person you know?”</p>
<p>“André.”</p>
<p>“Last name?”</p>
<p>“Uh… I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Miran froze at the unexpected question.</p>
<p>She knew that Western names included a last name. <em>It’s not like his first name is “An” and his last name is “Dré”…</em> So why had she never thought to ask? The more she realized it, the more ridiculous she felt.</p>
<p>“You… don’t know? Well, we have his first name, so let’s ask anyway.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk quickly composed himself and spoke with the concierge.</p>
<p>“Good news—he still lives here. So you just want to drop this off for him, right?”</p>
<p>Miran nodded eagerly and handed over the envelope. Seunghyuk passed it to the concierge, exchanged a few words, then turned back to her with a bright grin.</p>
<p>“He said he’ll deliver it.”</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh, thank you so much!!”</p>
<p>Miran bowed deeply in gratitude.</p>
<p>“Seunghyuk, dinner’s on me tonight!”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk shook his head as if the idea were completely absurd.</p>
<p>“You expect me to let a junior who just arrived in New York buy me dinner?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that! You showed me around all day, bought me a T-shirt, helped me out here too—”</p>
<p>“No way. If you keep insisting, I’m just going to head home.”</p>
<p>Seunghyuk put on a mock-serious expression and turned as if to leave. Panicked, Miran grabbed his arm.</p>
<p>“Oppa! Don’t be like that. Please, let me treat you to dinner, okay?”</p>
<p>They ended up bickering in the lobby over who would pay. Finally, he let out a small chuckle and ruffled her hair.</p>
<p>“Geez. Miran, do you really want to buy me dinner that badly?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Absolutely.”</p>
<p>Miran nodded eagerly, flashing a bright smile.</p>
<p>Just then, a cool, low voice cut through the air, calling her name.</p>
<p>“…Kang Miran?”</p>
