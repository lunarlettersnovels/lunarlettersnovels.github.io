            <p><strong>Chapter 48.1</strong></p>
<p>Miran burrowed into his embrace and mumbled.</p>
<p>“Is today… Monday? What time is it?”</p>
<p>“Six in the evening. Room service will arrive soon. Rest a bit more.”</p>
<p>Andre unwrapped her arms from his waist and left the bed.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>Miran asked, suppressing her urge to grab his sleeve and beg him not to leave.</p>
<p>“To make a call.”</p>
<p>She watched Andre’s retreating back as he left the bedroom. He had an especially cold back view. It felt somewhat heartless how he could leave a woman who had been pressed against his side like one body, without even a backward glance, as if he had no attachments.</p>
<p>She sighed and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Really now. Making a big deal out of nothing…”</p>
<p>The bed seemed too large now that she was lying alone – something she hadn’t noticed when they were together. Miran groggily sat up. Every muscle in her body screamed in protest.</p>
<p>“Ahh…..”</p>
<p>Miran groaned and flopped back down onto the bed.</p>
<p>A sweet ache ran through her intimate area, still slightly gaping from taking Andre in. Her body, softened by his lips and touches, was mottled with love marks. Her legs were too sore with muscle pain to walk properly, and her inner thighs were swollen and tender.</p>
<p>Apart from the physical discomfort, Miran couldn’t remember ever feeling this fulfilled in her life.</p>
<p>In those moments of physical union with the person she loved, a mental pleasure no less intense than the physical swept over her in overwhelming waves. It always brought her to tears when this overflowing emotion mixed with the pleasure that shook her whole body.</p>
<p>“I wish time would just stop.”</p>
<p>There were only two days left until Andre’s departure. Perhaps that’s why her nose would sting whenever he disappeared from sight, even briefly. Miran rubbed her hot eyes with the back of her hand.</p>
<p>“If I’m like this now, what will I do when he leaves…”</p>
<p>Andre was speaking to someone in English in the living room. Besides room service, this was the first time she’d heard him make a phone call. Miran held her breath and perked up her ears. His resonant baritone voice was pleasant to hear.</p>
<p>Miran groaned as she got up. Her naked body showed through Andre’s shirt she was wearing.</p>
<p>“He could have at least buttoned it up for me.”</p>
<p>Miran chuckled while fastening the front buttons. It was just like Andre to put his shirt on her but leave it unbuttoned.</p>
<p>His hands were too large to calmly undo tiny buttons in moments of passion. It felt rather human that this man, who seemed like nothing could faze him, was actually quite impatient.</p>
<p>Andre’s shirt felt soft and luxurious against her skin. Noticing something sparkle in the sleeve, she turned her arm over to find cufflinks inserted in the buttonholes of the neatly folded French cuffs.</p>
<p>The round silver cufflinks had the letters A and L engraved on them, with a rather large cubic zirconia set between the two letters.</p>
<p>“So that’s what was sparkling.”</p>
<p>Seeing the same initials embroidered on the cuff ends and shirt pocket, it seemed to be the name of his preferred brand. It was somewhat amusing that while he hadn’t buttoned up the shirt, he’d left the cufflinks in. Thanks to them, the long sleeves that covered to her fingertips were neatly secured at the wrists.</p>
<p>When she left the bedroom with unsteady steps, forcing strength into her trembling knees, Andre looked up from where he sat on the sofa talking on the phone. His green eyes slowly traced over Miran in his shirt, showing the lazy satisfaction of a well-fed beast.</p>
<p>[Yeah, just for two days. I know, and I’ll pay you back. That is none of your business.]</p>
<p>When Miran stood a little away from the sofa, Andre leaned back and gestured for her to come closer. As she hesitantly took a few more steps, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her onto his lap.</p>
<p>Wrapping his strong arm around her waist, he brushed his lips against her temple where her pulse beat rapidly. It was a natural gesture, like longtime lovers. Every time he did this, her heart would flutter like riding a roller coaster, making her feel dizzy.</p>
