            <h3>Chapter 46.2</h3>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>Andre rarely apologized. He’d never done anything to deserve an apology, and he’d never been in a position where he had to apologize for anything. Yet, before doing something worse to her, who was in pain for the first time, an apology slipped out of his mouth.</p>
<p>As a last act of conscience, he wrapped his hand around the base of his length to prevent it from going too deep. This way, he could only insert about two-thirds, but that was enough.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Andre thrust his hips in one swift motion.</p>
<p>“Ah! It hurts, ughh…”</p>
<p>Miran clung to his shoulder, crying sorrowfully.</p>
<p>Andre, trembling with satisfaction, buried his nose in her slender nape, wrapping his arms around her head.</p>
<p>Sharp and cold adrenaline spread through his nerves like ice picks. Apart from the guilt of hurting Miran, the pleasure raced up his spine and exploded like a bomb at the top of his head.</p>
<p>Andre have her some time to adjust, before slowly withdrew his lower body before thrusting deeply again. As he continued to rub her cl!t0r’is, Miran’s body stiffened in pain, but the p pleasure was just as intense, her lower belly twitched and her inner walls tightened.</p>
<p>Observing her reactions, Andre rotated his hips in a circular motion, rubbing against her inner walls, and then slammed his hips into the spot he had stimulated with his hand earlier. It was a calculated move.</p>
<p>“Ahh…!”</p>
<p>Miran’s eyes widened in surprise as she blinked. Andre sighed in relief. Thanks to the pillow propping up her hips, he could easily find the right spot without having to thrust in multiple places.</p>
<p>His back was drenched in sweat. He couldn’t remember ever having to work so hard to make someone feel good, to push his self-control to the limit.</p>
<p>She was a fascinating woman. It was unsettling how she kept drawing out things he didn’t even know existed within him. Yet, he couldn’t bring himself to cut her off coldly.</p>
<p>Andre bit his lower lip and arched his back as he thrusted in her in short intervals. His hand rubbing her cl!t0r’is moved faster. Miran gasped, her lips twitching like a fish on water.</p>
<p>“Ha, Andre!”</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>Mirani closed her eyes tightly and trembled. He brushed his lips against her jaw, tracing a path up to her earlobe, and gently nibbled on it. If he could, he wanted to put her in his mouth like a cherry-flavored candy, melt her, and swallow her whole</p>
<p>“Ah, Andre, An…!”</p>
<p>As Mirani twisted her waist, her full peaks swayed, brushing against his bare skin. Her lips parted in a whimper, and her eyes went unfocused. He angled his length and thrust upward at a fast pace.</p>
<p>As he thrust into her, the sloppy, wet flesh made a squelching sound, like a sticky liquid stretching and pulling apart.</p>
<p>He pressed Miran down until their lower bellies were touching, and rubbed her cl!t0r’is with his pelvic bone. The thin skin of her abdomen seemed about to tear as his length bulged and moved, and he could feel it in his own abdomen as well. Andre’s expression contorted.</p>
<p>[F#!ck.]</p>
<p>This was also his first time experiencing this. The extreme excitement and intense pleasure sent shivers down his spine. His strength and size were overwhelming, and he feared he’d break something if he tried to force himself on the thin, slender Miran.</p>
<p>He restrained his rough movements as much as possible and swung his hips rapidly. With one concentrated thrust, her hot, soft inner walls couldn’t take it and began to clamp down on his member, squeezing frantically.</p>
<p>“Ah, haah!”</p>
<p>With lips parted, Miran arched her back and pressed the crown of her head into the bed. Her flailing hands tore at the sheets before clinging to Andre, leaving long marks on his back.</p>
<p>Andre’s green eyes, filled with fierce heat, flashed. His whole body stiffened and he let out a suppressed groan toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Andre’s thighs stiffened like a rock at the shuddering pleasure of his cl!m#x. He grasped her pelvis firmly and slammed into her again and again. His vision flashed red as he watched the skin on her belly bulge with each thrust of his c@`ck.</p>
