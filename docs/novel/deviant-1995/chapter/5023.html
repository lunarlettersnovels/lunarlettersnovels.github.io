            <h3>Chapter 45.1</h3>
<p>A shot of pleasure rushed through Miran, sending shivers down her spine just from the firm hands that pressed and rubbed her.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Her whole body stiffened, and her back arched at the light cl!m@ax that came too soon. Her p&amp;ss#y clenched and unclenched repeatedly, hips buckling at the electrifying pleasure.</p>
<p>Before Miran could gather her senses, Andre grabbed a pillow from the head of the bed and placed it under her lower back. Then, he used his fingers to part the soft, swollen flesh that had become slick with blood. The deep pink flesh, now wet, occasionally twitched with spasms.</p>
<p>Andre’s brow furrowed deeply as he studied the too-narrow opening.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>With a fierce look in his eyes, he exhaled roughly and moistened his dry lips before pushing one finger in firmly. Without pause, another followed.</p>
<p>“Haa!”</p>
<p>Miran’s head snapped up and she gasped in surprise at the sight below her waist. It was an overly lascivious sight.</p>
<p>The pillow had naturally elevated her hips, leaving her exposed. The flushed and parted area, red like a split fruit on a plate, and Andre’s hand with his index and middle fingers inside.</p>
<p>The shame of knowing that Andre was watching all of it without blinking was greater than the dull pain and foreign sensation she felt in her delicate inner walls.</p>
<p>As Miran struggled to close her legs, Andre grabbed her knees and shoved his head between them. Her pale chest quivered and rose and fell rapidly. The man, with a stoic and aristocratic face, glanced at her, buried his lips between her legs and then extended his tongue like a beast. When he circled her cl!t0r’is with the pointed tip of his tongue, Miran shuddered and arched her back.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Her tightly gaping entrance clenched around his fingers.</p>
<p>“Easy, it’s okay.”</p>
<p>When he said this, placing his tongue on her cl!t0r’is, Miran shuddered violently.</p>
<p>“There, right there, mmmm!”</p>
<p>Andre pretended not to hear and stretched his tongue and pressed the nib just the way Miran liked. His tongue rolled and teased her, sucking and licking as if to absorb her. Every time he stimulated her in various ways, her trembling inner walls squeezes his fingers tightly as if crushing them.</p>
<p>Andre, sensing that Miran’s cl!m@ax was near, removed his lips and covered her flat lower abdomen with his hand.</p>
<p>“One more.”</p>
<p>The voice, heavy with warning, came out low and dark.</p>
<p>“No… please, no.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, her thighs shaking. Andre soothed her gently, his large hand rubbing slow, comforting circles over her lower belly.</p>
<p>“Here. Don’t tense up.”</p>
<p>One thick, long finger pressed further, spreading the delicate entrance wider as it slid in. The unfamiliar stretch tugged at the tight muscles, coaxing back the pain that had only just begun to subside.</p>
<p>Miran bit down on her lip, her breath hitching. Watching her intently, Andre’s thumb brushed lightly over her sensitive bud.</p>
<p>“Aah!”</p>
<p>The sharp jolt of pleasure mingled with the dull ache, crashing over her all at once. Her lips parted involuntarily, letting out shaky, breathless m9an. Miran felt like her mind was going to explode. Andre stopped moving when he noticed her stiff thighs trembling.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Miran blinked through tearful, unfocused eyes, trying to catch her breath. Her face was red, but her bitten lips were white.</p>
<p>“…So far. I can manage.”</p>
<p>Her voice wavered, the end of her sentence trembling like she might break into sobs at any moment.</p>
<p>“Good girl.”</p>
<p>Andre murmured a praise and extended his arm to cover her chest. He spread his palm fully, rubbing gently over the peak. The unusual sensation caused the inner walls surrounding his three fingers to tremble as if receiving a signal. When he pressed the peak between his fingers and rubbed before pulling firmly, the contracting inner walls abruptly tightened. Andre’s fingers were squeezed so hard that blood circulation seemed restricted.</p>
<p>“Haah.”</p>
<p>Andre exhaled a breath toward the ceiling. He, too, was nearing his limit.</p>
<p>He wanted to give Miran more time to adapt, but the strain of his length, pressed tightly within his pants, was becoming unbearable, even painful. At this rate, he was going to come in his pants before he could do anything else.</p>
