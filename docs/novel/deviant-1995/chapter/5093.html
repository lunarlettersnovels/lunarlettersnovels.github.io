            <p><strong>Chapter 10.1</strong></p>
<p>“…Really? More than Apgujeong-dong?”</p>
<p>“Apgujeong-dong has ‘Yata*’ but those guys usually hang out in groups of two or three. If you want a clean one-night stand, Itaewon is much better.”</p>
<p><em>*Yata (야타) is a slang that describes guys who drive around picking up girls for s3x.</em></p>
<p>As Jieun, with her remarkably good diaphragm control, spoke loudly, Miran gritted her teeth and glared at her.</p>
<p>“Ma Jieun! You might as well advertise it, huh?”</p>
<p>Jieun looked around and then closed her mouth.</p>
<p>“Anyway. You’re saying you want a rehearsal before the shoot. In that case, wouldn’t a foreigner you’ll never see again be better? Nightclubs in Gangnam won’t work. Everyone there knows each other, and if weird rumors start spreading, it’ll be a hassle.”</p>
<p>“Really? But how can I do that with someone who doesn’t even speak the same language…?”</p>
<p>Jieun snorted.</p>
<p>“My Miran C, you’re so naive. Se.x is a universal language. If the eyes and hearts connect, you just do it. You don’t need much talking. Didn’t you and your friends ever pass around adult videos in school? Did those have any dialogue? Just moans, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, seriously, Ma Jieun! Lower your voice.”</p>
<p>“Hey, we’re adults. What’s wrong with talking about S-E-X? In this country, the word ‘se.x’ is more taboo than Marxism was in the 80s. It’s so frustrating. Anyway, if you’re going for a one-night stand, make sure to bring condoms. If you want, ask the pharmacy for pills to delay your period. They say you won’t get pregnant while taking those.”</p>
<p>“Gosh. Could I really get pregnant from doing it just once?”</p>
<p>At Miran’s innocent question, Jieun grimaced and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Ugh. This is why the education system in Korea is problematic. They don’t provide even the level of sex education that I received in elementary school in the US, so you’re 24 and asking these things. Pregnancy is like Russian roulette. Some people don’t get pregnant no matter how much they do it day and night, while others do it once and get pregnant.”</p>
<p>Since Jieun had lived in the US from 5th grade to her first year of middle school, she spoke English quite well and had a liberal mindset.</p>
<p>“Really? They teach that in elementary schools in the US? In our high school sex ed class, they only showed us a scary video about what happens if you get an abortion. They didn’t teach us what we actually needed at a time like this!”</p>
<p>“I know that video. It’s just brainwashing young girls to not even think about having se.x before marriage. They hide the real information, so we have to learn by running into walls.”</p>
<p>“At least we didn’t get direct purity education. My oldest sister said her se.x ed was all about purity.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s so 70s. Miran C, it’s already 1995. There’s no need to put so much meaning into your first experience or your first guy. On that point, I surprisingly agree with Hyuna.”</p>
<p>Miran playfully gave Jieun a thumbs-up.</p>
<p>“Wow, Jieun. As expected of someone who lived in the United States, you’re so open-minded.”</p>
<p>“And you’re surprisingly conservative for someone so young. Gen X disqualified!”</p>
<p>Jieun giggled, exhaling cigarette smoke. Being called conservative was like being told you resembled the old-fashioned older generation.</p>
<p>For their generation, who longed to live differently from everyone else, it was the ultimate insult. As expected, Miran bristled.</p>
<p>“Why am I conservative? I’m open-minded, too!”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? Then shall we go to Itaewon?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go! Why wouldn’t I?”</p>
<p>Provoked by Jieun, Miran boldly shouted. The two, who had been drinking coffee at a small café behind Tower Records in Gangnam Station, immediately grabbed a taxi from Gangnam Road, crossing Hannam Bridge to keep Miran from changing her mind.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Itaewon was a fascinating kaleidoscope of exotic sights. Having never traveled abroad and rarely encountered foreigners, Miran felt as if she were on an overseas trip.</p>
<p>The bustling street was filled with a mix of English signs, U.S. soldiers in uniform, foreign tourists, young locals out for a look, and hawkers selling fake brand watches and bags.</p>
<p>As soon as they settled into the Western bar ‘Cactus,’ which Jieun claimed had the best crowd in Itaewon, two young and handsome foreigners sat next to them.</p>
<p>One was in military uniform, and the other was in civilian clothes.</p>
