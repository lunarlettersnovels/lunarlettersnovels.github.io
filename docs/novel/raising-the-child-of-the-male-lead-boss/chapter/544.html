            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 216 – Reclaiming What Was Lost (2)</strong></p>
<p>Even if they did, she could still pretend not to know anything. The beauty salon was not under her name. Those real estates, she could say her mom bought them for her! What proof did they have!?</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie thought about this and smoothed down her breath.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Yu Yaoyao burst out laughing!  “Misunderstanding? How come, I even kept the sound recordings, do you want to hear them?” she asked innocently, under the guise of wanting to clarify things with her sister, but she was just tightening her grip over her.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie’s face instantly paled, at this Yu Yaoyao drew closer, and asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Where did the money go, when did you borrow them, the transactions were through which banks, and to whose accounts…I remembered everything very clearly, Sis, do you want to take a look?”</p>
<p>She pushed the notebook to Yu Xinjie.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie just took a look, and felt that her brain exploded! Then Yu Yaoyao had indeed been playing dumb in front of her this whole time!?</p>
<p>In the notebook, every single amount was written clearly, some of them she didn’t even remember, but now all the records were reminding her!</p>
<p>Did she make sound recordings?</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie suddenly felt terrified and got cold sweat on her back. She looked at the seemingly harmless, innocent, pure, and pretty face of Yu Yaoyao, and couldn’t help but take a deep breath. She held the notebook tightly, and wouldn’t let it go.</p>
<p>What had gone wrong, that Yu Yaoyao suddenly became so shrewd?</p>
<p>“Sis, I’ll take it back and ask Mom.” Even her fingers were shaking now. Yu Yaoyao chuckled innocently.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, just take it, I have them all in my head anyway,” she reassured.</p>
<p>She didn’t care if it were before when her wealthy husband still got all the money, it would be inappropriate for her to take back the money that the original owner of the body had given away.</p>
<p>But the situation was different now, millions of dollars can buy so many steaks and lobsters for her baby! She giddily thought.</p>
<p>“Hee, Sis, you know how to joke….”</p>
<p>“No, I never joke,” Yu Yaoyao smiled and patted her arms, “There is one thing that I care about….” She said and looked at Yu Xinjie with fierce coldness. “Whoever takes my stuff, I will take it back,” she spoke clearly, and menacingly, “Whoever stole my food, I will let them spit it out!”</p>
<p>While speaking with a smile on her face and a cotton-like tender voice, the ferocious eyes like beasts startled the hand that Yu Xinjie held the notebook with.</p>
<p>“Sis…I’ll go back and…ask.” Yu Xinjie almost jumped up from the chair.</p>
<p>She was in such a hurry to leave that she almost knocked over the dining chair right next to her.</p>
<p>“Oh my, this chair is really expensive, I think it is made out of mahogany, about 2 thousand dollars. Is that right, honey?” Yu Yaoyao turned to her husband, asking innocently.</p>
<p>But Yu Xinjie suddenly felt that she was targeted by a beast in the forest!</p>
<p>“Sis, I’m leaving now! Rest early!” she all but yelled. She moved the chair aside and hurried to leave, but a fork appeared unexpectedly in front of her arms.</p>
<p>She looked up and saw Yu Yaoyao’s beautiful small face, with coldness gleaming in her eyes.</p>
<p>“We only see you once now and then, and you’re leaving like this with empty hands?”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie was getting lightheaded, and quickly thought up an excuse…</p>
<p>“I…I brought a very good bottle of vintage wine with me……for my brother…brother-in-law.”</p>
<p>She had gone through all the hardships for this good bottle of wine. It was a really good wine from a French winery, quite difficult to get even if you have money. You have to know people in the community, and one even needed to understand wine down to a tee.</p>
<p>Originally, she wanted to put it in her wine cellar, and show it off to let her friends appreciate it.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“This cost me tens of thousands!” Yu Xinjie gritted her teeth, wincing as she knew she had to give it up.</p>
<p>“Well,” Yu Yaoyao looked like she was observing the silver patterns on it and frowned, glanced at Shen Yichong, and reluctantly said, “Keep it.”</p>
<p>She doesn’t drink but she knew her dear husband could.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie blinked as she heard it. Was Yu Yaoyao now a bandit?</p>
<p>“The wine is good, but I hope that you and Yichong still have a good mood to taste it.” Yu Xinjie gritted her teeth, threw out a sentence with a sneer. “Perhaps, Yichong’s biggest cash cow is going to fly away soon, Chen Jiao….”</p>
<p>She was halfway through the sentence when she realized something was not right, and abruptly stopped. But the damage had been done. She didn’t stop soon enough.</p>
<p>And every pair of eyes in the living room were now trailed at her!</p>
