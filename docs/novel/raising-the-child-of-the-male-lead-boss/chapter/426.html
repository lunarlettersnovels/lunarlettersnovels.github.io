            <p><strong>Chapter 337 – Shame Comes After Anger (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Ordinarily, ‘Old Iron Art’s’ account on Weibo didn’t attract much attention at all, but Yu Yaoyao had not posted or published any updates for the past week. This had led to the YY fans trying to sate their curiosity by trying to find out any information about her through other people’s accounts. More and more self-proclaimed YY geniuses were appearing every day. They could usually find out just about any detail about Yu Yaoyao from the ‘Seven Years’ crews’ Weibo accounts.</p>
<p>But for the past two days, the actors from the cast had barely been active. It was with great regret that the fans had to find another course of action.</p>
<p>As Yu Yaoyao’s manager, Ni Yi’s Weibo was the first target. It was quickly found and closely followed by the fans. That very morning, Ni Yi’s check in picture was of a tall building. One of the hardcore fans quickly identified it as one of the base camps for magazine photoshoots.</p>
<p>The fans were elated! Their Yaoyao could possibly have gone to shoot for the cover of a magazine. News of this quickly spread around the fan base.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s ‘confinement’ of Yu Yaoyao had unintentionally turned into a gigantic marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Because the fans hadn’t seen any recent updates from Yu Yaoyao, this discovery greatly excited them. Many of them even started trying to guess which magazine it was.</p>
<p>There were less than 10 local magazine companies that were somewhat influential. The fans used the process of elimination and investigated every official website. They ended up finding a few good clues along the way and narrowed the magazines down to three: ‘Beauty’, ‘Men’s Fashion’ and ‘Show’. Now that they had their three main targets, their workload was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Many of Yu Yaoyao’s fans were housewives and female white-collar workers. They either had plenty of free time, or they were intelligent, and resourceful. After less than an hour of diligent digging, the fans finally on the ‘Beauty’ magazine. It was then that they discovered ‘Old Iron Art’s’ Weibo account. The location stated on the Weibo account was the same as the location posted by Yu Yaoyao’s manager earlier that morning.</p>
<p>The account was also following the official account of ‘Beauty’ magazine. This person and the female makeup artists working for ‘Beauty’ were also following each other. The owner of the account regularly posted professional articles about color matching and light sources used when shooting.</p>
<p>The YY fans also discovered that ‘Old Iron Art’ was hinting at something and someone in the post. It seemed as though he was critiquing their Yu Yaoyao!</p>
<p>Five years ago, Yu Yaoyao had been a trainee under Guangxin. Since Weibo had already been popular back then, the fans found Ni Yi’s work Weibo account easily enough. Yu Yaoyao had indeed shot a middle page cover for ‘Beauty’ back then. Even though they were disappointed that they couldn’t see the final product photos of the previous shooting, they confirmed that ‘Old Iron Art’ truly was talking about their Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>This angered the loyal YY fans. They started posting:</p>
<p><em>[Old Iron, use your official account if you are brave enough! What a hero you are, critiquing people using a secondary account…]</em></p>
<p><em>[What nonsense is this? Are people really not allowed to make mistakes? It was five years ago! Can you guarantee that you work perfectly every day and never make mistakes? Why are you so salty? Are you upset because others are making more progress than you? Does it make you feel useless and embarrassed?]</em></p>
<p><em>[You also personally said that she was an intern. How could you blame an intern for ruining the layout? Why don’t you blame your entire team for being useless! Photographer, makeup artist, costume artist, background designer, and even the lighting engineers and the instructions the photographer was given? Everything is important! What are you trying to achieve by blaming a newcomer for such failure!]</em></p>
<p><em>[She went from trainee to teacher in five years. What about you? You’re still in the same place you were five years ago, aren’t you? Oh, congratulations for being stuck in life and blaming other people! Who are you that you think you can be so proud? You want her to grow up? Grow up, my @ss!]</em></p>
<p>It seemed that every fan with a terrible temper had flooded onto the account. But none of them mentioned Yu Yaoyao’s name. In the eyes of the other netizens who were just watching things unfold, these people seemed to be simply standing up against injustice.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei was waiting for Yu Yaoyao to finish in makeup and had been scrolling on Weibo. The more he had read through the comments, the redder his face had become.</p>
<p>“Old Hu, what’s the matter with you? You seem out of it. Are you upset because Teacher Yu didn’t recognize you?” the lighting engineer joked.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk nonsense!” Hu Yiwei snapped as his hand tightened on his phone.</p>
<p>The lighting engineer laughed, “You know I’m just joking. You take your job too seriously. If you hadn’t told me that she was here five years ago, I never would have remembered her,” the engineer said, trying to cheer him up. But if anything, it made him feel worse.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei waited until the engineer left. Once he was alone, he gritted his teeth and started replying to the comments:</p>
<p><em>[First of all, do you all even understand? Taking a photo is different from acting, nor is it equated to a person’s beauty. It requires self-confidence, control of the body, and a strong desire for expression!</em></p>
<p><em>She had none of these!</em></p>
<p><em>I have taken photos of people from the ages of 5 to 50. Trainees have no excuse. She was simply born with no special aura!</em></p>
<p><em>She didn’t know where to put her hands or where to look. She was always in an awkward pose and couldn’t rectify it no matter how much instruction we gave her.</em></p>
<p><em>The more I tried to teach her, the more she resisted, and the more she simply couldn’t relinquish her self-control while we were shooting! Her whole body was stiff, and she hardly fit into the scenes and emotions required by the photos.</em></p>
<p><em>We are not afraid of an ugly person, but we are afraid of someone who seems so ordinary standing in the background, especially if they have a beautiful face! Despite being so beautiful, I could not see anything special in her. There was no extraordinary personal aura to her, at all! Every single muscle in her body was rigid!</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s talk when you’ve seen the photos from five years ago!]</em></p>
<p>The more comments Hu Yiwei responded, the angrier he became.</p>
<p>Ever since he had met Yu Yaoyao five years ago, he still couldn’t understand it. How did a woman with no talent, who was afraid of being the focus of attention even get into the field? It was only when she took part in the ‘Beauty’ photoshoot as a trainee that he had realized she was relying on her husband’s resources.</p>
