            <p><strong>Chapter 423</strong></p>
<p>Chen Jiao went to watch the premiere of ‘Year’ that same day. As he expected, Yu Yaoyao didn’t show up. However, he couldn’t help clenching his fists when he saw her radiant look in her short video playing in the scene…</p>
<p>Many loyal YY fans also went to the scene, including Ye Yun, the vice president of the fan group, who had worked overtime non-stop a while ago and almost cut off all star-chasing work.</p>
<p>She wasn’t interested in art films, especially films with the theme of married women. She thought it would be difficult to resonate for a single woman like her.</p>
<p>But she still asked someone to grab her a ticket for the premiere since Yaoyao starred in it.</p>
<p>Ye Yun didn’t hold any hope for the story itself. She just came to appreciate Yaoyao’s acting skills.</p>
<p>“It’s really a pity that my husband Yaoyao can’t make it here today. I grabbed the ticket specially to see her.”</p>
<p>“She can’t help it… She had already posted on Weibo a week ago and said that she couldn’t come. Mr. Shen wouldn’t let her, sigh.”</p>
<p>A pair of sisters was sitting next to Ye Yun, and they were obviously also fans of Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Ye Yun interrupted as she listened, “She is due soon. It wouldn’t be convenient for her to come. Speaking of it, I saw some people at the door looking strange. It’ll be very troublesome and dangerous for her when she enters or exits the venue..”</p>
<p>The parking space was full when she was going to park, so she had to go to the underground car park of the shopping mall next door. She saw the brawny men with tattoos when she came into the venue through the back door of the cinema.</p>
<p>The two girls suddenly realized that Ye Yun was also a loyal fan of Yaoyao. Otherwise, it would be impossible for her to consider and worry so much for Yaoyao.</p>
<p>They immediately chatted with Ye Yun.</p>
<p>“Right. Safety is still the priority. I was just praying for a miracle. I already expected that Yaoyao would probably not come to the scene.”</p>
<p>“By the way, are you in the fan club? Did you watch Yaoyao’s live broadcast a few days ago? It’s so funny.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun had a lot to catch up on because of her busy work. She quickly caught up with some recent updates of Yu Yaoyao from the video saved by the girl.</p>
<p>They finally fell silent when the organizer began to speak. But soon, the girls yawned listlessly. This theme of the film really cannot appeal to their age group.</p>
<p>“Even if it doesn’t look good, I’ll still give Yaoyao a high score when I go back.”</p>
<p>“I heard that pregnant mothers need to be in a good mood.”</p>
<p>“Right. That’s a must.”</p>
<p>Her good friend also echoed in a low voice.</p>
<p>“I heard that our President bought a lot of tickets for the show and gave them to his relatives. He wanted everyone to go watch it so the box office would look nice.”</p>
<p>“There’s really no way for the box office of an art film to look nice. We could only beg that it wouldn’t rank at the bottom..”</p>
<p>“Anyway, we could all contribute a little. I plan to bring my parents with me on the weekend, and probably my sister and brother-in-law. It’s about marriage anyway.”</p>
<p>The two girls were obviously not ordinary fans. In order to help Yu Yaoyao win the box office, they have mobilized the whole family.</p>
<p>Ye Yun was a little embarrassed when she heard that. She felt that she wasn’t contributing that much as the vice president. She immediately took out her phone and booked weekend tickets for her parents.</p>
<p>When the film started, they were all quiet. They were silently waiting for Yu Yaoyao’s character to appear on the big screen. As time passed by, the whole theater was very dull. This was an extremely realistic work.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao appeared, people were shocked.</p>
<p>Although there were already trailers, her first appearance surprised many people.</p>
<p>The dark circles on her face were very heavy, and even her cheeks were severely spotted. There was even acne on her forehead. She was busy in the kitchen when the child was crying after falling in the living room. Hearing her child crying, she could only hold the spatula while hurrying to hug the child.</p>
<p>Holding her heavy son in her arms,  she cooked and served the dishes while wiping the table. After feeding her child, she had to mop and clean the floor. When her husband finally came home, she also had to warm up the food for him.</p>
<p>Her husband’s face was full of exhaustion after returning home from work. He was already giving her an impatient look after she said a few words, and he absent-mindedly and casually hummed twice in response.</p>
<p>The image of Yu Yaoyao had to change in the film, and fans have long known about it. But they didn’t know she would look so similar to a housewife who had been married for many years in the film, or in other words, an old mother in the family.</p>
<p>“Gosh. She’s kind of like my mother. My mom brought me up by herself.”</p>
<p>“This’s how my sister is like now. Ever since she has a child, she hasn’t even changed her hair style.”</p>
<p>Soon, an inner monologue of Yu Yaoyao sounded in the cinema. She looked in the bathroom mirror after her husband was asleep..</p>
<p><em>‘I don’t know since when I have changed.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘I don’t think about wearing makeup at home, neither do I think about what clothes I should wear every day. All I think about is what to cook, when to pick up my kid, and when will my husband come home. ’</em></p>
<p><em>‘That’s right. Year after year, I’ve become an ugly woman that even my husband wouldn’t want to take another look at. ’</em></p>
<p>In this monologue, her way of speaking was very emotional. She sounded a little helpless, and she seemed to be reminiscing about the days when she was single.</p>
<p>The audience thought this part of the film was very close to reality.</p>
<p>At this moment, many single women who thought they couldn’t resonate with the film at first all thought of their mothers or other female elders. As for the married women, they couldn’t help but grasp the seat support on their side.</p>
