            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 122 – Sofa…play?</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a deep breath and calmly said, “Close your eyes.” He stretched out his hand and covered her eyes which were oozing with attractiveness.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had the urge to struggle again, but then she felt a large, thick towel soon cover her from head to foot. When Shen Yichong looked at her body completely wrapped in the towel, her pink toe not even showing, only then he felt slightly relieved and expressionlessly opened the door.</p>
<p>To Ni Yi, who was guarding the door, he only spat out a few words.</p>
<p>“Bring my phone.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi paused for a moment, then senselessly placed the ginger tea in his hand and his mobile phone. The door in front of him was once again kicked shut.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t the boss’ mood too violent?</em></p>
<p>But soon after, Chen Lin came running from the outside with two bags.</p>
<p>“Is the boss inside? These are the clothes for the madam and the boss!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi looked into the paper bag with surprise when he heard it and his whole fat face was shocked, “You know?”</p>
<p>Chen Lin: “…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi stretched out a hand and wiped his neck, “Sister Yu’s…” and with his other hand in the air, he drew an S…</p>
<p>“Size…”</p>
<p>Chen Lin stared. Before he could speak, the door opened.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong carried wet clothes, and the look in his eyes was worse than ever! There was even a hint of obvious anger which directly made Chen Lin tremble. Chen Lin opened his mouth, wanting to explain, but before he could, he was almost driven to his knees when Shen Yichong brutally slammed the door on him.</p>
<p>He immediately turned to Ni Yi with a cry as if on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>“Brother, don’t you talk nonsense, don’t hurt me! How would I know the madam’s… I, I don’t know anything! The maid bought it!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s fat face froze, then turned to cough embarrassedly. Smiling shyly, he said, “Hehe. I was just casually speaking…”</p>
<p><em>Goddamn! </em>Chen Lin almost strangled him. His boss’ eyes then were almost strangling him! If he really knew the size of the his boss’ wife, then he is surely to swallow death!</p>
<p>Ni Yi patted him sympathetically and lowered his voice. “It’s okay. You should raise your voice. The boss can certainly hear you inside.”</p>
<p>Chen Lin: “…”</p>
<p>Inside the room now, only when Yu Yaoyao drank two full cups of ginger tea did finally her frozen body eased somewhat. Her fingers can finally move flexibly, even her little face can make a smiling expression, no longer stiff.</p>
<p>She can’t help but direct her look towards the other side of the room, where Shen Yichong was busily dressing in a new shirt. She licked her lips that had regained their color.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s head was bowed as he was tying his tie when he caught whiff of a faint fragrance slowly approaching.</p>
<p>Then… his shoulder sank. A restless little hand, like a small snake, climbed up. Even the soft, almost boneless body leaned against his back.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s delicate voice sounded like sin in his ears. “Husband, I can move now… you can continue.”</p>
<p>His hand that held the tie suddenly became blue.</p>
<p>“Where should I lie? What posture do we use?” Yu Yaoyao stood on tiptoe and pressed her body closer, and licked his earlobe…</p>
<p>It was as if a bolt of lightning struck his body. And as if something had been shattered, his eyes held the look of a beast just released. He took a deep breath, reluctantly forcing the impulse in his eyes down.</p>
<p>He grabbed her slender wrist and took her back to the sofa!</p>
<p>“Sofa play…?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao excitedly swayed her hips and her beautiful eyes lit up! And Shen Yichong wished nothing more than to strangle her. He gritted his teeth. “You are still working.”</p>
<p>“Ah, what a pity…” Yu Yaoyao’s lips were slightly parted, and he could feel her breath on him, “Then let’s make an appointment tonight. Sofa play in a hotel. You deserve it…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, his face turning silly upon hearing her words. He fiercely reached out to hold her chin and pressed her down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, please settle down for me.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Kidnapping foreplay?” Yu Yaoyao’s face turned red upon her exclaim. But soon she closed her eyes and her body trembled, an exaggerated panic displayed on her face.</p>
<p>“Do you want to tie me up? Tying up someone else’s hands… oh, I’m afraid… help…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>“Give me… ginger tea!”</p>
<p>She was more tiring than teaching his son!</p>
