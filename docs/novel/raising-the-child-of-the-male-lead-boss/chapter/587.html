            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 166 – A Birthday Doll (2)</strong></p>
<p>He clenched his jaw and looked down, seeing the turbulent curve made by her dress.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment ~ Tantararan~”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao went inside the room and launched a huge gift box hidden inside the bookcase. At that moment, Shen Yi Chong’s black eyes flashed with great anticipation. The huge box was almost as high as his waist. She’d also tied a crooked bow with some decorations on the package.</p>
<p>“Open it now!” Yu Yaoyao blinked all over, looking at him, hoping to see some excitement in his face.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth immediately overflowed with a helpless smile. Seeing that all the cameramen had entered the study and were filming them, he couldn’t help but only look at them. He also glanced at his excited wife, firmly pressed his lips, and took the gift from her.</p>
<p>Everything was new to him. First, she wanted to be an actress and perform in front of the camera, and now she gave him a special gift. Since she wanted him to open the gift now, he just went with the flow.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong bent over and opened the box, allowing one of the cameramen to take a close-up shot of the gift.</p>
<p>His expectation upon opening the gift faded unconsciously. Meanwhile, the cameraman taking the shot was strangely holding his laughter. Zhao Yu glanced at Shen Yichong and looked at the package with a face full of interest.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong backed away for a moment before looking at it again with a scrutinizing gaze. In an instant, he looked completely bewildered and his handsome face was somewhat distorted.</p>
<p>“What is this!?” His steady voice was now out of control.</p>
<p>What he just saw on the package was a delicate doll, almost the same size as Yu Yaoyao, wearing a thin short skirt. This type of doll was something that people wouldn’t want to see because they would feel crooked! Every feature that women should have, was seen on this doll! Slender waist, legs and arms, full breasts, and if one were to look closely, her face was white with rosy cheeks. It’s kind of inexplicably similar to Yu Yaoyao in appearance.</p>
<p>“Husband,” Yu Yaoyao stepped forward and took the doll out of the box. “Look! It looks exactly the same as me~”</p>
<p>“Everything is based on my vital stats and appearance, height 166 cm, measurements of 90, 60…” She was halfway through her blabber when Shen Yichong covered her mouth with his hand.</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” His voice was quite husky, with a hint of annoyance!</p>
<p>At that moment, the cameraman next to Shen Yichong was quite lucky to have been able to record his stunned face, which looked like he’d just discovered a big baby!</p>
<p><strong>“The stoic president went home and received his wife’s gift. A doll used for something more intense!”</strong></p>
<p>This was a headline that no broadcasting station could ever come up with.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu simply couldn’t believe Yu Yaoyao’s extraordinary ideas! He bet that the screenwriters would neither have the skills nor the courage to write such exaggerated scripts! And what she did was so completely out of the ordinary that even the impassive Shen Yichong went mad as a hatter!</p>
<p>“Husband, if I bag the first place in the next challenge of  ‘In the Limelight’, I’ll definitely be cast as a female lead for an upcoming online drama,” she said and sighed in empathy. “Listen, Ni Yi said that in the future I may have to film in foreign countries or distant places. If you want to call me… Uhm, in case you miss me too much, let Yaoyao No.2 entertain you. Okay?” She further added.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face went from dim to black.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, what do you think you are doing?”</p>
<p>For the first time, he called her full name in front of the camera! He couldn’t help it as his blood was now boiling with rage!</p>
<p>Oblivious to the brewing tempest before her, Yu Yaoyao nodded heavily, looked at her husband, and smiled. “Husband, it doesn’t matter. I asked every staff member and they all said they are married.” She looked around as she continued. “Everyone here is an adult, don’t be shy, Husband.”</p>
<p>All the cameramen lowered their heads, even Zhao Yu looked away immediately. Sure enough, they really wanted to laugh at this iconic situation but they knew that President Shen would definitely glower and burn them with his gaze.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t actually understand the nature of these inflated dolls. She just simply wanted to surprise Shen Yichong and rid him of his loneliness. She knew how loneliness felt, she’d lived in an empty snake house for very a long time. She was utterly discomfited with the idea of being alone.</p>
<p>“If I am not at home, Yaoyao No. 2  will accompany you. Got it?” She declared.</p>
<p>“When you miss me, just look at the doll~” She added.</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s right!”  Yu Yaoyao remembered something and immediately turned around to look for a small bag inside the package.</p>
<p>“Husband, you can also change Yaoyao No.2’s clothes~”</p>
<p>With excitement, she showed Shen Yichong the small bag. “I made it when I went to the shop, one is an old-fashioned Chinese Han suit, I would definitely want to wear it, and the others are sailor suit and school uniform, which were recommended by the shop owner. She said sailor and school uniforms are the most popular outfits and had the highest sales volume!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face was darker than the bottom of a wok.</p>
<p>The moment he saw Yu Yaoyao reach out to the doll and about to take off the dress on its body exposing its structure underneath, he felt that his head had blown up. He suddenly grabbed her little hand and held it tightly!</p>
<p>“Don’t make any more trouble!” he said, tersely.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked sullen but still nodded obediently.</p>
<p>“But still, Husband, the clothes of Yaoyao No.2. I will leave it here for you to take off yourself.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt that his cerebrovascular vessel had exploded a little.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was still holding his laughter… leaning against the wall, and knocking on the wall with his fists multiple times. But Yu Yaoyao did not stop.</p>
<p>“The store owner also said that the doll has a very magical function, Husband.” Her face looked excited and her eyes sparkled brightly.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao No.2 can talk, so that means you can also listen to my voice~” She went on. “I haven’t had the time to try it yet since you came home early…,” she said, with curiosity, “Let’s try it!” and bent to follow the instructions indicated on the manual.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t have the time to stop her as Yaoyao No.2 had her chest facing down, and was directly knocked down near the edge of the box.</p>
<p>Under one impact, a clear sigh… a moan of a woman was heard… it rang clearly in the study room.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong : “…”</p>
<p>He still held her small arm. She looked incredibly amazed but still pouted after listening for a while.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem to have the same voice as mine…”  She felt wronged.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s entire being was shocked, his body a little stiff.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu and the cameraman could no longer hold it in, they burst out into laughter without a care for their future.</p>
<p><em>It’s so satisfying to come here and shoot, working with this family is unbelievably fun!</em></p>
