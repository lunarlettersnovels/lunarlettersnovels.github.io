            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 17 – Unexpected Death Flag</strong></p>
<p>Ni Yi almost cried. “Sister, there’s a picture of this?”</p>
<p>“Let me call the company right away!” Yu Yaoyao retorted.</p>
<p>“Sister!” At this point, Ni Yi was beyond exasperated. “Read your cheating love letter posted on social media first! Did you really write it?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eardrums were ringing by the minute and she took her phone a little further away from her ears. “Don’t be so excited. What’s the big deal?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s relaxed grip on the pen loosened and his fist clenched around the paper. He was crazy to believe that she would change her wayward ways. And to even think there he had a flicker of hope that she would finally do her duty as a mother—this agreement inside his hand was mocking him for his delusional thoughts.</p>
<p>Shen Rui, who had been focused on playing the jigsaw puzzle in his tablet, also lowered the device down.</p>
<p>“Stop the car!” Shen Yichong ordered in a cold voice, his jaw was tight and his body tense.</p>
<p>As soon as Yu Yaoyao finally realized the strange atmosphere, she immediately felt the fire around her.</p>
<p>“Wait!” She hurriedly exclaimed, “Hear me out first! Don’t sentence me to death!” hastily taking looking at her mobile phone to drop the call. She looked for the Weibo APP and opened her microblog. Heading over to the ‘news’ section she was immediately bombarded with numerous articles of her earth-shattering love letter.</p>
<p>Another scandal that the netizens had feasted upon. But after she was able to confirm it, Yu Yaoyao merely breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>On the front of the site was an official statement:</p>
<p><b><i>— Big Fish Entertainment: Yu Yaoyao suspected to be secretly in an affair with film emperor Chen Jiao; autographed love letter below! </i></b></p>
<p>Within the clear picture, each handwritten word on the paper could be easily recognized. The news media was even more demented and recorded an audio version of it.</p>
<p>As soon as Yu Yaoyao played the attached voice recording, a delicate but pretentious female voice drifted out.</p>
<p><b><i>— October 20, 2020:</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>This is the 23rd day after I first met you. I had always yearned to know you more; God knows how many days and nights I had been looking forward to meeting you.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Once upon a time, I had always fantasized scenarios of our first meeting, but no matter how many times my imagination runs wild, it was no better than the first time I truly saw you.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I believe that’s what people refer to as fate, and might I add love.</i></b></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao swallowed. “Don’t worry, this is just slander!”</p>
<p>As soon as she defended herself, however, the voice track presented an analysis of the love letter’s credibility!</p>
<p><b><i>According to the investigation on this love letter, on September 27, 2020, it was the first day of filming for the TV show: ‘Grand Hero”. It was in this show that Yu Yaoyao first met the film emperor, Chen Jiao, also consequently working with him for the first time.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>The date is exactly 23 days from when this love letter was written! </i></b></p>
<p>It concluded dramatically.</p>
<p>Sitting between the two adults, the little bun’s small body couldn’t help but tremble at the onslaught of this information. He had wanted to take another look at Yu Yaoyao, but upon hearing the recording, his mouth shrunk, and he quickly lowered his pale, little face.</p>
<p>His little hands balled into fists on his side.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s heart shivered in horror. “This is a mistake! A misunderstanding!”</p>
<p><i>Oh, my God!</i> <i>She wasn’t able to see this recording coming!</i></p>
<p><i>Her death flags have multiplied!</i></p>
<p><i>Yu Xinjie, you’re f*cking talented! I’ll give you that! </i>She could only bitterly curse in her heart. She did not expect that the small steamed bun would hear about his mother’s affair.</p>
<p>“Honey, Mommy didn’t write this,” She meekly said, but Shen Rui made no move to listen to her.</p>
<p>“No, no, no… let Mommy explain this to you.”</p>
<p>But the little bun stubbornly held his head down, slowly turning his round face towards his father. He silently buried his face on Shen Yichong’s arms and allowed his father to carry him in his embrace.</p>
<p>The door opened and Chen Lin hesitantly made a gesture, asking her to get out of the car.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Yu Yaoyao scratched her head but remained seated inside the car.</p>
<p>“I admit, I did write this letter, but—ah!”</p>
<p>The little bun’s head on Shen Yichong’s shoulder suddenly shook and his icy stare swept towards her. Hugging the little bun tightly, he opened the door, resolute to get away.</p>
<p>The air was heavy as if it had solidified.</p>
<p>But the moment Shen Yichong got out of the car, he was instantly pulled back by the corners of his suit by a delicate, but firm hand.</p>
