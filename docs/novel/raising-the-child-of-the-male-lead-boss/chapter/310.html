            <p><strong>Chapter 453</strong></p>
<p>“Ah… the ratings of the program are affected because I’m staying at home,” Yu Yaoyao lamented. She suddenly realized this fact.</p>
<p>She looked at little Sweetheart, who was dressed in pink. She looked like a ball whose body was tender and soft. Her fists were fair, and she was irresistibly cute. Every time when her Little Sweetheart looked at her direction with a pair of watery eyes, her heart would melt instantly. She was so cute that Yu Yaoyao didn’t feel like leaving her Baby Bun at all!</p>
<p>She didn’t want to travel far. Although confinement was boring, she was very satisfied staying with Little Sweetheart every day. Moreover, she could also shop online at home. She loved looking at different cute clothes for her little girl and dressing her up like a princess.</p>
<p>It was like a real-life princess dressing game!</p>
<p>“What should I do, darling? Did we land Director Zhao into trouble?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao originally thought her husband could handle it. But she quickly realized that she might be needed in the show.</p>
<p>In the first episode, Shen Yichong was totally addicted to just doing housework, while Little Bun was only focusing on playing and doing his homework. If it weren’t for Chen Jiao’s arrival, she was sure this episode would have been scrapped. Neither the father nor son had any desire to perform on camera.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao held her forehead, feeling a little helpless. But when she turned her head and saw Shen Yichong’s stoic face, she shook her head. It was too difficult to make her husband liven up for a variety show.</p>
<p>A wry smile appeared on Shen Yichong as he was glanced at her. If it wasn’t for his wife and children, he wouldn’t even be on the show.</p>
<p>“It’s not that bad.” He touched his nose. “Didn’t you say you were super lonely? Maybe you can help think about the content of the next issue for Director Zhao.”</p>
<p>It was a big problem if his wife had nothing to do. Shen Yichong had never been a person who would detain his family, nor was he a husband who would force his wife to go to work.</p>
<p>However, there were many examples of postpartum depression. A few days ago, there was another news of a mother committing suicide. Just now, he had clearly seen the loneliness in Yu Yaoyao’s eyes. Not only did Chen Jiao’s public apology not make her happy, but she even felt pity and regret that she now had no competitor.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong thought so, he became more worried. In any case, he had to make Yu Yaoyao happy. People tend to overthink when they had nothing to do. In this case, it’s better to let her help Director Zhao and indirectly help her.</p>
<p>“You can think of something that you can do without needing to leave the house. This way, you could also help Director Zhao.” Shen Yichong said it seriously. “The current danger the program is facing was also caused by us.”</p>
<p>He had a hundred ways to save the ratings, but he decided to let Yu Yaoyao get creative this time. “I’m going to the company tomorrow. If you can’t think of a way, you can have your friends over.”</p>
<p>She could invite Ren Sitong over. Since she was also a mother of two, her experience might help relieve the psychological pressure Yu Yaoyao had.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took out his phone as he spoke. If Yu Yaoyao wasn’t going to call, he would call Dafu personally to invite his wife to come over.</p>
<p>Earlier, he saw several doctor interviews and several professional analysis reports. Many people said that a woman was prone to psychological problems during confinement and breastfeeding after giving birth, mainly because she had to breastfeed the baby occasionally.</p>
<p>During this period, there was nothing else she could do except breastfeeding. In the end, many women would feel that they have become an instrument who had no meaning of life apart from feeding their children.</p>
<p>When the husband came home after a busy day at work, he couldn’t understand why his wife would be depressed when she was only resting at home. He might even only feel that his wife was complaining of an imaginary sickness.  Since the wife’s emotions cannot be resolved even by their closest person and leaving the child at home just to meet their friends outside is unthinkable, the problems in their heart become deeper.</p>
<p>Most cases of postpartum depression happened this way.</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, Shen Yichong thought it would be better to divert Yu Yaoyao’s attention.</p>
<p>“Okay then,” she agreed. As expected, her eyes were gleaming when she heard what he said.</p>
<p>It sounded like her husband really couldn’t handle it, and Director Zhao seemed to be facing a lot of problems… It looked like she had no choice but to go out, right?</p>
<p>“Alright, darling! Don’t worry, I’ll help Director Zhao~”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squeezed her face when he finally saw her regain the energy she had on the stage.</p>
<p>“Remember not to stress yourself out. Let me know if you face any problem.”</p>
<p>It was also time for him to return to work.</p>
