            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 33 – A Steamed Bun’s Worries</strong></p>
<p>It was not until his footsteps sounded faint did the steamed bun nervously place the picture book down a little, exposing a pair of round, black eyes, carefully watching his father disappear toward the top of the stairs. Once he was out of earshot, he quickly opened the small tablet under the cushion</p>
<p>He closed the video he was just watching and switched the tab to the online primary school math curriculum’s interface.</p>
<p>When all this was done, his little mouth let out a puff of breath and he patted his little chest comfortingly.</p>
<p><em>Whoo</em>. The baby was almost scared to death.</p>
<p>Many times at night when he got up to pee, he would hear his father and mother quarrelling.</p>
<p>Although he could not understand many complex things, he knew that his father thought his mother had many shortcomings and thus, did not like his mother very much.</p>
<p>“If dad knew mom had done something wrong again, he would certainly hate her even more.” Shen Rui, holding the small tablet, frowned and clenched his small fists.</p>
<p>Although his mother used to have a lot of mistakes, ever since she bumped her head, she had admitted these shortcomings to them.</p>
<p><em>And mom said, she actually loves me and even wrote me a love letter…</em>The steamed bun thought. His face was hot, and his short palms stretched out to cover most of his blushing cheeks.</p>
<p><em>Mom also said dad was angry because she didn’t love dad the most. </em>Dad is really…jealous of a five-year-old baby like him?</p>
<p>The steamed bun decided to take good care in hiding his mother’s past, dark news so that his father could not see it. But after a while, his little ass moved a little and he couldn’t sit still.</p>
<p>“Mom read will read chicken legs this time! If she gets scolded by uncle, dad will know, a-and then he will be sad!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a quick shower, later changing into his casual clothes and went downstairs. He found his son walking back and forth anxiously in the living room with his pair of short arms behind him, like a little, chubby, white, old man.</p>
<p>“Dad,” steamed bun immediately flushed and stopped. He was hesitating, but in the next moment he rushed over and hugged his father’s thighs. “I miss mom.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had been in the house for so long before, but would not even play with their son, at least within his line of sight.</p>
<p>Today, nevertheless, is the first day she would be away from her son.</p>
<p>He thought about it and picked up his son. “Your mother has to behave well on her first day at work.”</p>
<p>But as Shen Rui listened, the more entangled his mind became, and he could not help but cover his small face.</p>
<p><em>Oh no! Mom’s script is full of drumsticks! Can she do it?!</em></p>
<p>After a while, he finally thought, <em>It’s no good!</em> He has to go and save his mom!</p>
<p><em>At the very least, when mom is scolded, I’ll stay with her. Should I say something nice to dad?</em></p>
<p>“Dad, let’s go to the set and see…mom is all right?”</p>
<p>The steamed bun even came to know this kind of word in his vocabulary, it can be clearly seen that he had been reading a lot of entertainment news on the internet behind his back.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pursed his lips in disapproval.</p>
<p>The steamed bun’s little head immediately glanced at the ground and quieted down.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t agree to go to Yu Yaoyao’s filming set the way Yu Yaoyao would act would probably drive him and his son to an early death.</p>
<p>But an hour later, the steamed bun remained in the same position: listless, lost; sadly holding the tablet as he was pitifully huddled in the corner of the sofa.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s resolve finally wavered.</p>
<p>He called Ni Yi to make sure that when they went, Yu Yaoyao would only film one last scene, so that the visit would quickly be over.</p>
<p>After some time, he finally nodded to his dejected son, “Let’s go. Dad will take you.”</p>
<p>When they get to the set, it would just happen to be the end of the filming session for that day, and his son wouldn’t be able to see her act like this.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s plan is well though out, but in the end, he did not consider the rapid changes happening with the crew.</p>
<p>Yu Yao used to have only one scene with lead female actress. And Ni Yi had expected this scene to last in less than an hour, but there was a problem!</p>
