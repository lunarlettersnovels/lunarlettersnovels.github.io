            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 114 – How She Changed</strong></p>
<p>He dragged the bar forward again as he skipped the parts of other contestants until the part where someone finally woke the slumbering Yu Yaoyao up. It was also this time the last prop, which was incidentally damaged, was given to her.</p>
<p>“Disfigurement? Assistant director, are you so jealous of my beauty?” Her voice, although soft, held a severe tone to them. Her little face was positively dripping with confidence as a dangerous light flashed through her eyes. It was as if she was born to be on the screen.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s lips couldn’t help but hook up as his eyes flashed a rare trace of appreciation.</p>
<p>Five years ago, he had always felt that her appearance belonged to the big screen by nature. But as if she had gone through a period being dormant inside a cocoon, now her whole body has turned into a butterfly. And he is entirely unable to pick any flaw from the video.</p>
<p>When she came to the stage to perform, Shen Yichong could not help but sit straight on the sofa. He even paused the video a second time as he reached for a bottle of mineral water on the tea table to take a sip.</p>
<p>Disfigurement—she should be an amateur to such a topic.</p>
<p>He pressed a finger to his temple, mentally getting ready before starting the video, his current cold and stern face looking grave. His brows furrowed when he saw Yu Yaoyao hastily getting carried onto the stage. When she woke up, she looked at herself in the mirror with narcissism.</p>
<p>Soon, there was a shrill scream.</p>
<p>From Shen Yichong’s mobile phone, the sound is even more emotional and horrible. It could be heard even clearly from his earphones, especially in the quiet night. In an instant, goosebumps sprang from his arms and veins broke out from his stiff, slender fingers holding the mobile phone.</p>
<p>His handsome yet expressionless face looked like an iceberg that stood erect and was broken by the hull of an incoming ship. The seemingly hard ice and snow crushed in a flash, submerging into the vast ocean and melting into pieces…</p>
<p>In the video, a slender figure knelt on the stage, covering one side of her face. An intense, endless look of grief displayed on her face, as if she had lost the whole world and despaired.</p>
<p>In the past five years, he had never seen this kind of face even when she cried for money or injustice.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, with a tight jaw, made a beeline for the desk to take a cigarette. However, as much as he wanted to take a smoke at the moment, he suddenly realized that he still in the hotel. With a tilt of his head to the side, he saw the mother and son nestled together, sleeping in the big bed. He froze and withdrew his hand.</p>
<p>He knew a long time ago that she was versatile in drama. However, it was the first time he had seen her cry as if bitterly wronged to the extreme.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows twisted as he looked at the video. He didn’t hear the judges’ comments nor the consequent voting that ensued. He was deaf, even as the host opened and closed his mouth.</p>
<p>At present, his mind still stuck to the poignant expression of collapse and despair on her face…</p>
<p>It was not until her voice rang again in the night and the shy and charming smile—one she began to don after being discharged from hospital—became evident on her face did Shen Yichong regain his bearings. Even more so, his heart thumped, anticipating the shameless words that would come out from the woman’s mouth.</p>
<p>Sure enough, he soon heard her delicate and <em>incredible</em> speech at the end of her acting.</p>
<p>“…the thought of my husband seeing an imperfect me breaks my heart to a million pieces, and my if my baby sees his mommy become so ugly, he’ll be driven to horrified tears! Despite my lack of acting skills, everything that has inspired me to this point—can only be attributed to love…”</p>
<p>The phone fell straight onto the sofa as Shen Yichong eyes became filled with astonishment. In the next second, a long stream of single dog comments following this statement appeared.</p>
<p><strong>[This is the food this single dog will have to eat until the program is over?! It’s too sweet; I refuse!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Nourished because of loved…? Mom, I’m sorry your daughter can’t become an actor!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This single dog can’t even watch variety shows! How can this be full of dog food—I’m so jealous!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I envy boss Shen, ah~]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Please guess a song as your performance counterattack: “Because of Love”!]</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked like a devil, frowning at the stupid comments that kept piling on top of another.</p>
<p><em>Because of love? Yu Yaoyao?</em></p>
<p>He took a deep breath and decided to withdraw from the video.</p>
