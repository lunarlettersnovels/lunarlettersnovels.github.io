            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 86 – Two Sides of Separation </strong></p>
<p>Ni Yi swallowed his saliva and hesitantly announced his presence once again, “Boss, sister–I just received an urgent notice from <em>‘In the Limelight’ </em>crew that we will have to do emergency recordings for three consecutive days. Several important players also received the announcement.”</p>
<p>“Elder sister… may have to live onsite the set for now.” As soon as he said this, the little steamed bun was instantly stunned stupid.</p>
<p>He clasped Yu Yaoyao’s hand at once. “Mommy’s hands are still hurt.” As soon as his small mouth pouted to a downward arc, his eyes immediately filled with protest.</p>
<p>Ni Yi touched his nose and looked at Yu Yaoyao for help.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao also felt torn giving up her current state of comfort. At home, she had people to serve her, like her husband; there was also the little steamed bun she could play with. But when she went on set for the program, she had nothing.</p>
<p>She quickly looked at the steamed bun’s face showing his opposition against the idea. And then next at Shen Yichong, who became relieved the moment he heard the news–her heart suddenly thumped.</p>
<p>Her baby is very attached to her, but her diamond husband wants her to leave?</p>
<p></p><center><sup>Chapter By WordExcerpt</sup></center><p></p>
<div data-fuse="22037242891"></div>
<p> </p>
<p><em>This bastard!</em> Yu Yaoyao clutched her forehead.</p>
<p>“Mommy, what’s wrong? Is your head hurting again?” The steamed bun immediately asked nervously.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao shook her head. She stretched out her unhurt left hand and touched his little head endearingly. “No, mommy is thinking about something.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong licked his lip, “You go and live for a few days on the set. It’s only something very normal for artists. I’ll just have Ni Yi urgently find a work assistant to take care of you.”</p>
<p>As soon as he raised his eyebrows, his handsome face slightly showed his relief at the thought that he no longer had to feed or get commanded by a little man.</p>
<p>“Dad–” The steamed bun tried to voice his objection.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong merely cut his son’s statement instantly with a decisive look. “Acting is your mommy’s career and it’s also what she wants to do. We can’t stand in her way, can we? If you were in her place and you get locked at home, not able to do what you want, will you still be happy?”</p>
<p>The words the steamed bun wanted to say immediately got stuck on his throat.</p>
<p>His small mouth opened then he closed it weakly. He opted to hold Yu Yaoyao’s instead with his own small palms, his head held down.</p>
<p><em>Mommy is not happy at home…</em></p>
<p></p><center><sup>Chapter By WordExcerpt</sup></center><p></p>
<div data-fuse="22037344116"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>He immediately remembered her live broadcast from her preliminary competition: her sad mommy on camera who was trapped by a wall and couldn’t make her way out.</p>
<p>The steamed bun, Shen Rui, bowed his head frailly. “Okay.” But, somewhat worry still sang to him as he looked at Yu Yaoyao, “That… mommy should be careful not to get hurt again.”</p>
<p>As long as his mommy is happy, this little baby will wait at home for her to come back~</p>
<p>“Ruirui will count the pudding at home for mommy. Nobody can touch it until mommy comes back to eat!”</p>
<p>Yu Yao immediately looked at the reluctant steamed bun, her heart softening, and then looked at Shen Yichong again.</p>
<p>In many romance novels, both male and female protagonists experience a period of separation. And each time they parted, it later made the indifferent man realize the importance of the woman in his heart, making him miss her and cherish her all the more.</p>
<p>This short farewell will win her the wedding!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes flashed and declared, “Then I will stay for three days!”</p>
<p>Not knowing his sister’s real motives, Ni Yi Was only relieved, “Okay! I will inform the group now.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>At the moment, thousands of miles across the ocean, inside a student dormitory, several girls gathered around the bed inside the bedroom and chattered to the girl at the desk.</p>
<p>“Xinjie, your sister seems to be very good! You used to say that your sister’s acting skills were not good, but I really got a fright with her performance, ah!”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie almost broke the lipstick in her hand.</p>
<p>“Oooh…this brother-in-law of yours is also very fierce. Why didn’t you introduce him to us?”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie’s face almost twitched. Taking a deep breath to calm herself, she only managed to squeeze out a reluctant smile. With a succinct reply, she mumbled, “There will be opportunities in the future.”</p>
<p>She took her cell phone and clicked on the link shared by her roommate. And with just one look, her eyes lit up with irrational anger and intense jealousy!</p>
<p>After not answering her phone for so long, she was desperately trying to get through the announcement. With so many hot searches recently, the number of her fans has drastically risen.</p>
<p><em>Yu Yaoyao still wants to return?</em></p>
<p>Yu Xinjie bit her lip and looked at the official blog of the<em> In the Limelight</em> program, her eyes burning.</p>
<p><em>Doesn’t this Meng Xinran have more fans than her? Yet, she was actually trampled under Yu Yaoyao’s feet?</em></p>
<p>Yu Xinjie looked at her and decided to go to her official account. Taking advantage of her roommates’ lack of attention to her, she sent a private message.</p>
<p><em>[A Jewel: I have evidence of Yu Yaoyao’s cheating on hand, and a picture of her man at night.]</em></p>
<p>The fiasco with the suicide attempt and the gossip about Chen was a fail; the usual things had done to Yaoyao for amusement had actually backfired on her. The entertainment outlet she had sold her ‘evidences’ only accused her of cheating them out of her money and selling them fake news.</p>
<p>After Yu Xinjie finished typing, she nervously looked at Meng Xinran’s account and locked her cellphone. She waited as minutes passed…receiving no response. She immediately turned on the computer and copied a blurred picture out from a folder.</p>
<p>She sent the picture out together with a message:</p>
<p><em>[A Jewel: Yu Yaoyao meeting privately with someone in a five-star hotel.]</em></p>
<p>The rest of the family is hers—this elder sister of hers included!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p><em>Sneeze!</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao loudly sneezed while she was lying on the sofa.</p>
<p>The little steamed bum instantly looked over in worry, and hurriedly pulled the blanket from the sofa to cover her thighs.</p>
<p>“Dad, did you already put the hot water away?” The steamed bun quickly clattered to the second floor and went to supervise the worker for his unsatisfactory performance.</p>
