            <p><strong>Chapter 441</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong and Shen Rui were each filmed by a camera and appeared on the live broadcast screen at the same time. Wearing a headset, Zhao Yu deliberately asked the two sides to ask questions and answers asynchronously, in order to collect a wave of different answers from the father and son.</p>
<p>And it didn’t take long before the father and son had a huge disagreement on the question about the baby girl. Their respective self-confidence made the audience in the live room laugh out loud.</p>
<p>“How did you find your little sister/girl loves you more?”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu raised another treacherous question.</p>
<p>Little Bun hardly needed to think, “I’ll accompany my sister whenever I have time. I would sit next to her to play with her, read stories and talk to her. Now, as soon as I walk closer to the room, she will look at me with her eyes. My little sister sure likes me.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong next door was also very confident, “I turned down all the work arrangements, and had Chen Lin completed the largest acquisition project along with the investment department, just so I can accompany my Little Sweetheart at home every day. I change her diapers, and I take care of her at night. I’m also the one in-charge for feeding her at dawn.”</p>
<p>He gave a bunch of examples like his son.</p>
<p>“Now, as soon as I hold my daughter, she will smile at me. She sure loves her daddy the most.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu soon commanded the staff in the next room to ask another question, “It seems that your father/ son thinks Little Sweetheart likes him the most, not you.”</p>
<p>Everyone in the live broadcast room was almost suffocated from holding back their laughter. Zhao Yu did this deliberately.</p>
<p>Little Bun suddenly faced the camera with bulging cheeks. A trace of stubborness flashed through his dark black eyes. “How is that possible?” he began treacherously, “Before my little sister was born, I talked to her on the phone through mommy’s belly every day, and I picked out many beautiful dresses for her. Now that she is out, I even let her play with all my toys. Uncle director, my father is so much older than my little sister, and there is a generation gap with him and my little sister. She would also babble and sing when she sees me, but she won’t do that when she sees daddy.”</p>
<p>Everyone in the live broadcast room laughed at what he said.</p>
<p>And when it was Shen Yichong’s turn, he didn’t forget to embarrass Shen Rui.</p>
<p>“Liking Shen Rui? At best, she doesn’t hate him. Little babies like to be touched and hugged. The feeling of being in the mother’s womb makes her comfortable. Shen Rui can’t even carry the little girl. He can only look at her by the side, making his face familiar to his sister.”</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he also faced the camera with an extremely solemn face, as if he was declaring sovereignty.</p>
<p>“Little Sweetheart likes me the most.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu covered his mouth and chuckled. In fact, he also sent a staff member to Yu Yaoyao. If she was able to, she would watch the whole live broadcast and do a short video interview afterwards.</p>
<p>After the father and son were interviewed, they also knew each other’s proud answers from the comments in the live broadcast room. Since then, they were competing against each other throughout the day.</p>
<p>After the guests arrived, this competition even spread to the guests. Surprisingly, the guests invited by the program group this time turned out to be two heavyweights.</p>
<p>One of them was Gu Qianqian, the latest best actress award winner. The other guest that shocked the audience was Chen Jiao, who had a lot to do with Guangxin and Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Having Chen Jiao on this show made many people in the live broadcast very upset. Almost all the YY fans hated him. Many of them were unable to accept the fact that the program team had invited him.</p>
<p><em>[He is not welcome!]</em></p>
<p><em>[What is he doing? He obviously left, and now he wants to be back? Who and what is this acting for?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Hypocrisy! Realizing that you can’t stand alone, you’re back to hug your ex-boss’s thigh?]</em></p>
<p><em>[If it weren’t for Little Bun, I don’t even want to see this person!]</em></p>
<p>Chen Jiao couldn’t see the comment, but his facial expression was not very good. After all, he only came here for Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>No matter what, he wanted to ask her again. If she was willing to accept him, he could forgive her even if she had given birth to two children with Shen Yichong. But if she was not willing… then they would be enemies forever. If he were to have a conflict with Shen Yichong in the future, he would no longer take her situation into consideration.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, when he finally convinced Zhao Yu, and even paid a great price to join this variety show, Yu Yaoyao was not there!</p>
<p>“My wife needs to rest, and she’ll be at home for these two days.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong directly pierced the bubble of his hope.</p>
<p>There was a twitch on Chen Jiao’s face, but he forcefully put a smile on his face, “Mr. Shen, it’s okay as long as we have you here. We haven’t had heartfelt communication for a long time.”</p>
<p>He and Shen Yichong also needed to make things clear. Ever since Xu Hong was dismissed by Guangxin, he had been wanting to cooperate with the others. But he found that several crews that favored him and wanted to invite him to play the leading role were all gone, and they were even already looking for other actors!</p>
<p>Was this accidental or was this Shen Yichong’s doing!?</p>
<p>Chen Jiao wanted to make things clear with Yu Yaoyao mainly because he was becoming helpless after being suppressed by Shen Yichong. But if his opponent didn’t have the intention to let him live, he could only fight until the end.</p>
<p>Although Shen Yichong’s face was a little cold, he had always looked like this. The audience in the live broadcast room did not find anything unusual.</p>
<p>“Since you’re here, let’s follow our old rules of having the guests do the chores. You may go fishing.”</p>
<p>He was too lazy to even talk nonsense with Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>And Little Bun Shen Rui had already brought out the fishnet for him, “Go, Uncle Gangster. There are four of us for lunch, we need two fishes,” he instructed.</p>
