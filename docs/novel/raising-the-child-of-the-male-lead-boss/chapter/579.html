            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 175 – Her Logic (1)</strong></p>
<p>Chen Jiao looked confused for a moment. He suddenly felt delighted and moved, thinking that she could do this for him.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu didn’t find any anomaly in his speech and nodded. “Yes, but let’s not mention the title of the movie. After all, this is not a movie promotion meet. The ending is tragic, and it’s not really popular, therefore not many have watched this movie so far.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao nodded and turned to the big screen. Looking at the small black room, his peach blossom eyes narrowed looking for Yu Yaoyao who was not visible because of the angle of the camera.</p>
<p>Soon, the host proceeded to Shao Qing and asked for his assessment of Yu Yaoyao’s performance, “What does Mr. Shao think?”</p>
<p>Shao Qing reached for the microphone; his expression was somewhat solemn. “I want to ask Yu Yaoyao a few questions, can I?”</p>
<p>The host was startled and apparently did not expect the question he raised.</p>
<p>Arguably speaking, asking questions was not in the rules of the competition. But when he saw director Zhao Yu’s gesture from the corner of his eyes, he nodded immediately, “Okay, then we’ll call the contestant in the black room.”</p>
<p>As soon as the angle of the view was switched, everyone, who was just recently stunned by Yu Yaoyao’s extraordinary acting, was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>In the little black room, the goddess Yu Yaoyao had already settled down. Her smooth and defined legs resting on the stretcher of the reclining chair. The high-heeled shoes she was wearing earlier were thrown somewhere inside the room.</p>
<p>Holding the glass, she took a sip of it… drinking the remnants happily.</p>
<p>Everyone wondered what happened to that pain and sadness seen in her face a while ago. Now, her glamorous little face was full of excitement, with cheeks turning red.</p>
<p>As soon as the call went through, Shao Qing and the host had yet to utter a word. Thus, everyone could hear a little, charming voice coming from the little black room.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was sitting comfortably, turned back and asked the staff behind. “What kind of beverage is this?”</p>
<p>“It’s sweet and delicious~” she said, her lips had drink stains on them.</p>
<p>The staff, who was unaware that the call was already connected, immediately answered. “It’s a fruit juice named Guozhen.”</p>
<p>“Guozhen?” Yu Yaoyao’s eyes immediately lit up, making the audience inside the auditorium hold back themselves from laughing.</p>
<p><strong>[I thought she was backstage, silently wiping her tears…]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This might be another performance coming from the goddess… hahaha!]</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched at the sight of his wife. Little Bun, on the other hand, took his tablet and quietly spoke, ‘Guozhen’. Soon, he called the attention of his father and then pointed at the screen.</p>
<p>“Dad, let’s buy some of this.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong said in return, “Let’s make freshly squeezed fruit juice for your mother, instead.”</p>
<p>The little bun held his chin and thought, but a moment later he grunted. “Dad, I also want to try drinking this…Guozhen.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: ” … ”</p>
<p>As of now, the three judges laughed out loud. Shortly after, Shao Qing regained his composure and took the microphone.</p>
<p>“I still want to ask the most common question. When you were performing just now, were you thinking of something? How were you able to carry out this challenge perfectly? I’m really curious, because ten years ago, I didn’t have the confidence to demonstrate such abundant emotions and precision.”</p>
<p>When he heard the word <em>‘precision</em>’, Zhou Qiu nodded. To put it bluntly, the director had the biggest influence among the members of the production team. The performance of actors largely depends on the director’s instructions. An actor who can accurately express the right emotions that a director has in mind is rare and needless to say, certainly the director’s favorite among the artists cast in a drama!</p>
<p>And Yu Yaoyao apparently had done just that. She’d emoted this extremely complicated but meticulous sobbing scene to the T. The richness of her emotions lay not only in crying, but also in her powerful control over her every look, micro-expression, and body movements!</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu also looked at the big screen with interest. “I too want to hear Yu Yaoyao’s answer.”</p>
<p>He’d just recently discovered that each time this woman performed, she used her own unique imagination and understanding of the character.</p>
<p>Even the famous screenwriter, Liu Yazhi, who was known for her bad temper and meticulousness in the industry, was also impressed by her.</p>
<p>Everyone was quiet, almost holding their breaths, anticipating Yu Yaoyao’s answer.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao, as seen on the big screen, was obviously shocked. Hearing the voice from a speaker made her almost jump off the stool. She looked distressed, her hands shook and a few drops of Guozhen spilled on the ground.</p>
<p>The staff at the side drew the microphone towards her and motioned her to answer. She picked up the microphone bitterly.  Zhou Qiu smiled. “Just tell us about what you were thinking while performing, especially how you were able to control your expressions.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao tilted her head as if trying to recall. “The challenge said, drink a total of five sips of Guozhen. I thought that beverage would be very difficult to drink. The last time I drank something like that my tongue was sore and numb, and I felt a burning sensation in my throat. So, when I held the glass, I really didn’t want to drink it.”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu tilted his head,mulling what Yu Yaoyao just said.</p>
<p><em>Based on her answer, the grief and frown she expressed was because she didn’t want to drink it?</em></p>
