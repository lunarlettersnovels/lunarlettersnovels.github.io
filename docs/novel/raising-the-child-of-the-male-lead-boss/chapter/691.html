            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 60 – Her Ill Past</strong></p>
<p>At this moment, Yu Yaoyao behind the screen, who was appreciating her beauty and wiping her tears, suddenly covered her mouth and exclaimed, “I almost forgot. I should look at acting topic at the back of the door.”</p>
<p>This remark broke the silence on her live channel, and the keyboard warriors were woken up from their stupor.</p>
<p><em>What was that? Had they just lost their minds? </em>The group of people stared at their screens and stared blankly.</p>
<p>Soon, fans of the other channels rushed in. With these new streams of people unsuspecting of what had transpired earlier, the string of curses on her comment section continued again in an instant.</p>
<p>By this time, however, Yu Yaoyao was already behind the door, reading the plastered words.</p>
<p>She looked at it and merely chuckled.</p>
<p>Before, when she was admiring her beauty in front of the screen and talked to herself in appreciation. Now, her unexpected, light laugh at the live broadcast is like a sudden spring breeze; a hundred flowers blooming. Her rippling laughter, dazzling eyes and tantalizing red lips, almost lit her whole small face into absolute brilliance!</p>
<p>The new keyboard warriors who had just joined her channel were also struck in an instant!</p>
<p>The number of people joining steadily increased: 139…194…231…the jumping digits proved that the live broadcast wasn’t hanging, yet the whole comment section was silent!</p>
<p>Half a second later, several comments suddenly rolled out!</p>
<p><strong><em>[Wow! This sister is a bit… beautiful!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[Is this the face of a married woman who already has a child? Who specifically said on Weibo that the contestant on room 1 is a hideous aunt!? Come out and fight me! You are obviously blind!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[That beautiful giggle… oh, this person’s heart has been shot…]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[Call an ambulance, someone needs some emergency treatment asap!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[In other words, I can see this contestant dared to choose the first position; with this extraordinary beauty, even if she doesn’t speak, I’d still stare at the screen!]</em></strong></p>
<p>Soon Yu Yaoyao laughed as she read the paper on her hand and slowly unfolded it to show everyone through the live broadcast:</p>
<p><strong>Please act as a poor person.</strong></p>
<p>All of a sudden, it threw everyone in the channel into disorientation.</p>
<p><strong><em>[ A poor person? Isn’t this topic a little difficult for her? She’ll be eliminated!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[What a pity! Let me just stare at the screen for ten minutes and then go out…]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[If this is how a poor person would look, then my girlfriend’s face…well, it’s probably lamentable!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[Hey previous commenter! Do you want me to die from laughing? I’m here to scold the contestant; would you stop making me laugh?]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[+1. I suspect someone wants me to die from laughter and steal all my money!]</em></strong></p>
<p>Ni Yi looked at the live broadcast and laughed too. But soon, his heart began to beat in worry again.</p>
<p><em>A poor woman, </em>can his sister perform this character?</p>
<p>She was married into a rich family, she had an extremely handsome, powerful and rich husband, a lovely baby. Even though she had recently come back to the entertainment circle, she had unlimited resources at her fingertips thanks to her husband who is the boss of the entertainment company.</p>
<p>And even at home when he went to pick her up, he saw how she lived a privileged life.</p>
<p>She didn’t need to do any housework. Every day, she just fancily laid down like a true rich, madam. Someone would bring to her anything she wanted; she didn’t even have to leave the door to do errands, this cumbersome task was left to the housekeepers!</p>
<p>It can even be said that she is the envy of all women who want to have a comfortable and luxurious lifestyle all over the world! What she wants, she gets! There is nothing is missing!</p>
<p>The only drawback to everything thus far, is probably the unlucky fact that she was infamous in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was worried and heard Yu Yaoyao’s voice drift out from his earphone.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll start.”</p>
<p>Her soft and charming voice immediately stole the attention of everyone. And the paper in front of the screen was slowly taken away. After she uttered this sentence, her beautiful face once again reappeared on the center of the screen.</p>
<p>Her skin is flawless, not a blemish or pimple in place; even the pores of both cheeks could not be seen. Despite having no beauty filter applied on screen, viewers are still blown away by her beauty.</p>
<p>Although her beautiful face was smiling at the moment, but there was no smile in her eyes. As she looked at the camera, her bright eyes dimmed down quickly.</p>
<p>“Do any of you know how it feels to be hungry for months in a row?” As she spoke, she bit her lower lip and shook herself as if remembering the most terrible and darkest experience.</p>
<p>The keyboard warriors watching her live broadcast immediately typed out rows of scathing replies:</p>
<p><em>‘Deception!’ </em></p>
<p><em>‘Pretentious!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘You think we’ll believe that!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘A lie! Your husband is so rich!’</em></p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao’s eyes merely trembled as if her gaze was fixed at a distant place. Before she had become human, she had been thrown into the zoo by the demon law enforcement of the monster circle.</p>
<p>But that was only the beginning of a long nightmare.</p>
