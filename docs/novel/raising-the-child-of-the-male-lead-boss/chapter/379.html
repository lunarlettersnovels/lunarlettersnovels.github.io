<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>But the director had been very confident in the new version. He even went as far as to show him several other movies and dramas that had become popular in the same way. He had also assured Chen Jiao that the characters would be more vivid and attractive after the edit.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao slammed his fist on the seat.</p>
<p>His main focus had always been on acting. He didn’t know anything about the data in the film industry. He had believed everything the director had said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chen Jiao had thought Shen Yichong was just making up excuses to hide the fact that he was running out of money… He had thought that was why Shen Yichong was trying to find problems with the script.</p>
<p>But now… He thought back to what Shen Yichong had said on the phone. He could care less about who snatched away his investment plan.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s heart fluttered frantically.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had known for a long time that he and Wansheng had invested in ‘Allure’. He had also known that this seemingly successful project would fall apart. That was why he didn’t care. He knew that no matter who the investor was, they would face great losses.</p>
<p>He didn’t even care when ‘Emergency Moment’ was snatched away…</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyes stung. “Xu Hong, you bastard! Are you certain Shen Yichong wants to invest in ‘Emergency Moment’? Are you trying to land me in trouble? Did he find out that you double-crossed him? Is that why he gave you fake information?”</p>
<p>He was so full of regret.</p>
<p>But it was too late now. The investment agreement had already been signed. If he did not pay the fund, he would have to pay the penalty for breaching the contract.</p>
<p>And what would the Wansheng Group think of him?</p>
<p>They had followed him blindly and invested in ‘Allure’. And it was going to fall apart. They had trusted him enough to also invest in ‘Emergency Moment’. If that also ended in failure…</p>
<p>“No, Brother Jiao! I honestly heard Mr. Shen saying that he wanted us to contact the producer for the investment the next day!” Xu Hong said defensively. “This TV series will make money for sure! He even signed the investment application that we submitted!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao took a deep breath. “If we make a loss on this TV series… Xu Hong, Wansheng will teach you a lesson.”</p>
<p>Xu Hong promised again that the show would make money, but he sounded less sure of himself now.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao felt a terrible headache coming on.</p>
<p>The head of the film investment department of Wangsheng group invited him to have dinner that evening. He was the person who had communicated with them for these two investments.</p>
<p>During this meal, it was likely that he would be questioned, just like how he questioned Xu Hong. They would want to confirm the source and accuracy of the investment information.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao could do nothing but grit his teeth and agree. He soullessly looked at the growing flood of negative reviews on the Internet, thinking about what to say to Wansheng that night.</p>
<p>Later that evening when he went to the French restaurant, he ran into the people he wanted to see least in the world; Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong walked into the restaurant, tenderly holding his wife around the waist. Yu Yaoyao was smiling up at him, and he was looking down at her so lovingly.</p>
<p>The two of them looked perfect together.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao gritted his teeth when he realized they were going to pass by his table without noticing him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chen, although we made a mistake on ‘Allure’, we still have ‘Emergency Moment’, which is a theme supported by the government. This is a profession motivated film. I’m confident that we can get a good return. You always hear about the tense relationships between doctors and patients. I think the film is perfect for this hot topic.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao clenched his fist when Shen Yichong had noticed him.</p>
<p>“Guangxin also expressed interest in investing in it. Luckily, Wansheng is a step ahead.” Chen Jiao raised his head and looked at Shen Yichong arrogantly as he spoke.</p>
<p>He wanted to embarrass Shen Yichong in front of his wife!</p>
<p>Having your investment plan snatched away by others wasn’t anything glorious to be shared.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao narrowed his eyes. Sure enough, he heard Shen Yichong’s footsteps slow, and then pause beside them.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked down at him and nodded to Chen Cheng, the manager of Wansheng’s investment department. Then he looped both arms around Yu Yaoyao’s waist. “The loss on ‘Allure’ is estimated to be more than 50%. I heard Wansheng invested 200 million Yuan into the project, and that Mr. Chen personally invested 20 million. I know that the Wansheng family is quite well off, but Mr. Chen, isn’t that equal to about two years’ worth of your income?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s expression stiffened.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, since Mr. Chen likes emergency medical films, I’ll let you guys have it. Think of it as a gift. Or pocket money, if you will,” Shen Yichong continued.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao squeezed the fork in his hand. Pocket money!?</p>
<p>This boastful Shen Yichong!</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s head hurt with anger, but he understood what Shen Yichong was doing.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong did want to invest in the medical film, but Guangxin would treat them as a minor investment.</p>
<p>The reason why he hadn’t rushed into action and had only contacted the producer the following day was because the profit margin of the project was not tempting enough. He felt that the drama would never become a hit like ‘Youth Without Regrets’.</p>
<p>The fact that Chen Jiao and Wansheng were a step ahead of Guangxin didn’t cause them any losses. They were waiting for him to make a fool out of himself!</p>
<p>“I’ll make the move first.” Shen Yichong nodded and smiled at them. Then he led Yu Yaoyao to their table.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Once she was seated, Yu Yaoyao scrolled through the hot search on Weibo while she waited for Shen Lin to bring Little Bun to the restaurant.</p>
<p>She was surprised to see how much criticism ‘Allure’ was receiving. This was totally unexpected!</p>
<p>“Darling, you’re so good at this, did you already expect this to happen?” Yu Yaoyao asked, looking at Shen Yichong in admiration.</p>
<p>The way he had roasted gangster Chen back there was brutal. Her flattery unknowingly made him as proud as a little kid.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he replied as he reached out to touch her forehead.  “You don’t have to worry. As long as our child doesn’t spend money like he is a billionaire, we won’t starve to death; even if we don’t work. When you get sick of filming, you are more than welcome to stay at home.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes squinted as she smiled. “Darling, you are the best! But you’re so outstanding that I want to be just as good!” She didn’t want to go back to the days of just sleeping and eating like she had done in the zoo. “If there comes a day where I choose to stop filming, I want to be at your side. I could be your secretary!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was stunned for a second.</p>
<p>Shen Lin overheard the conversation as he brought Little Bun over. He immediately broke out into a cold sweat at the thought that he might lose his job.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a call came in just in time and stopped Yu Yaoyao’s dream of being a secretary.</p>
<p>“Boss, the call was from Director Zhao of ‘Wife’. He wants to arrange a time to record the last episode of the season. He asked if it was possible for us to go to the cottage now?” Shen Lin breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>His job was temporarily secured.</p>
<p>“Give them the location of the restaurant. We’ll meet them here and I’ll buy them dinner after the last episode has been filmed,” Shen Yichong said with a smile as he watched his wife’s expression while she looked over the menu.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was close enough to hear the conversation. His face twitched in irritation.</p>
<p>On average, it would cost about 5000 Yuan to feed one person at this restaurant.</p>
<p>He was nowhere near as rich as Shen Yichong. Perhaps he would never be as rich, no matter how many roles he played, or how many awards he won.</p></div>
