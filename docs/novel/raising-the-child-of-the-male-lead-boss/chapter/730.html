            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 21 – A Broken Vase</strong></p>
<p>Ni Yi placed a hand on the top of his chest, his earlier worry still refusing to ebb away. But after a while, he received a notice from the ‘Golden Age Empress’ crew asking Yu Yaoyao to report to the site in the next week.</p>
<p>In the face of this unexpected message, Ni Yi could only mumble. “Sister… don’t tell me you did this intentionally?”</p>
<p>Her Weibo post not only showed that her relationship with the boss was not broken down but also sneakily placed Director Li Bo on the hot seat. At the same time, while taking advantage of the previous site traffic she had from her hot searches, she was able to promote the new show and herself.</p>
<p>This is really killing three birds with one stone, and it has also saved the production team on hefty promotion fees. Now Li Bo unexpectedly wanted her to appear on the set!</p>
<p><i>Everyone has been shot down!</i></p>
<p>“When did sister get so smart?” Ni Yi exclaimed, “Is this a miraculous side effect of hitting one’s head?!”</p>
<p>But after some time he smiled and shook his head. “The boss was probably around and helped her out. Sister is truly on cloud nine!”</p>
<p>In just a few days, she was able to occupy the hot searches repeatedly! Originally, she was out of the acting scene, being at home for four years. She had only 20,000 to 30,000 Weibo followers, many of whom became dead fan accounts over time.</p>
<p>But now, her followers shot up to an astounding 120,000!</p>
<p>Ni Yi was currently studying this spectacle when he was suddenly interrupted by a call from Yu Xinjie.</p>
<p>“Little Jie.” He answered cordially. Supposedly, as Yu Yaoyao’s manager, he should not be in charge of her life affairs. But at the moment she didn’t have a personal assistant, therefore that work was passed to him.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie’s urgent reply came seconds later, “Brother Ni! What is wrong with my sister? Why isn’t she answering my calls?!”</p>
<p>“Oh, haven’t you gone online? She was admitted to a hospital and was also slandered on the net. After all that, she has no energy to deal with anything anymore. Wait for a few days until she gets her bearing back; I will ask her to call you back by then.”</p>
<p>As Ni Yi was about to hang up, he said, “I’m going to send the script to your sister. I’ll talk to you later.”</p>
<p>The voice on the other end of the line became shrill, “Script? What? With elder brother Chen?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Ni Yi replied.</p>
<p>“She had an affair or could be in the middle of it. How—I mean, even if my sister released a picture of her ultrasound, people who don’t know the real truth will still suspect her. The director of the show should care about the reputation of the actors, right? Wasn’t that all true?”</p>
<p>“It was all proven fake!” Ni Yi replied a bit heatedly. He thought Yu Xinjie’s tone was a little strange, but he didn’t really care. After all, this little sister was studying abroad and might be acting a bit standoffish, or it might be due to cultural differences.</p>
<p>He smiled and nodded, “Although gossip on the net can confuse anyone, the director is not a fool.”</p>
<p>There was a sudden clang at the other end of the line as if something had been smashed.</p>
<p>“Little Jie?” Ni Yi frowned.</p>
<p>The breathing on the other side was a little heavy, audible over the cheap speakers, but it soon returned back to normal. “Oh, it’s nothing. The cat just broke a vase.”</p>
<p>“Oh, huh? You can keep cats in your dorm room?” Ni Yi was surprised and remarked, “Sure enough, foreign countries have a very open-minded stance on things.”</p>
<p>But Yu Xinjie wasn’t paying attention to anything he said. “Brother Ni, did my sister tell you anything? For example, is she going to divorce my brother-in-law?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s smile widened a bit more. “Nothing. She just posted a picture. Currently, their family of three is in a good relationship.”</p>
<p>“Little Jie, information online is unreliable; too many people are asking for trouble.” Afterward, he said in a more serious tone, “You shouldn’t believe anything you see on the net; you should always place your trust on your sister.”</p>
<p>“No, but my sister said—”</p>
<p>“I know.” Ni Yi interrupted. “She asked me just recently to send her wedding photos to the director. And she’s not divorced, mind you.” As a parting remark, he said, “You study at ease!” before the call was dropped.</p>
<p>Someplace far away, bright, red fingernails almost dug into the wooden table. The broken pieces of the vase were scattered all over the floor, the pink lilies trampled to pieces.</p>
