            <p><strong>Chapter 347</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was laughing so hard at Shen Yichong’s funny praise that she couldn’t even get up from the bed.</p>
<p>Just after they’d returned to the hotel, Little Bun had given Shen Yichong his tablet. On there, he had displayed the online school for essay writing he had found, as well as other praises he had found online. Then he’d patted his father on the shoulder in what could only be described as encouraging. After that, he had ignored Shen Yichong further and run to Yu Yaoyao’s arms.</p>
<p>“Daddy, you can’t leave this room until you have finished writing your essay!” he said in delight. He sniffed at Yu Yaoyao’s sweet perfume, and then lifted his face to her with a smile. Little Bun took the opportunity to have his mother to himself.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong rushed to the corner of the room. He was holding a pen and a paper, ready to write praises to Yu Yaoyao. It was his first time writing such things. While he listened to the mother and son laughing happily, he read through the examples his son had found for him:</p>
<p>‘At first I didn’t believe it; only now do I know that the existence of a single person can make me feel as though I have a fairy godmother.”</p>
<p>‘The world may not be worthy, but you are… I love you.’</p>
<p>‘Even the 40-degree heat can’t melt me, but your smile has melted my heart. Sorry, mom. I’m in love!’</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was speechless. His son was only five years old; he shouldn’t be seeing such things!</p>
<p>After struggling for half an hour, Shen Yichong finally put away the tablet. He rolled up his sleeves and, with some difficulty, started writing his very own praises. Although his ears went red from embarrassment twice, some of what he wrote were his sincere thoughts. He could never have expected that Yu Yaoyao would laugh out loud after taking a single glance.</p>
<p>She had only looked at it for a second before she started rolling on the bed with mirth. Towards the end, she even got cramps in her calves.</p>
<p>As Little Bun was reading out what he wrote, his love letter full of coy praise turned into an ‘adult’s only’ letter.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s jaw tightened. He stretched out his hand to take the paper in his son’s hands away.</p>
<p>“Don’t, don’t, don’t… darling, don’t take it away,” Yu Yaoyao wheezed. She held her belly which ached from laughter and stretched out her hand to grab his arm. “I want to keep it as a souvenir. I will put it in a photo frame.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s expression relaxed a little at that.</p>
<p>“That way, I can laugh at it forever!”</p>
<p>His expression fell flat again.</p>
<p>Although Shen Rui didn’t know what was going on, he mimicked Yu Yaoyao’s way of giggling, holding his tiny belly like her was.</p>
<p>The family of three fussed and laughed for a long time. They only stopped when it was finally time for dinner.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was halfway through finishing her dinner while admiring the love letter Shen Yichong had written for her, when she suddenly raised her head, her eyes transfixed on the writing. Her expression was daze as she stared down at it.</p>
<p>“Ya…”</p>
<p>Love letter…</p>
<p>Once she managed to calm herself, a long-forgotten memory surfaced.</p>
<p>Oh god!</p>
<p>There was something from that author!</p>
<p>The expression on Yu Yaoyao’s face twitched as she was overtaken by embarrassment.</p>
<p>The original owner of this body had had a past relationship with Chen Jiao when he was younger! Now it made sense! He was her unattainable person at the beginning of the book. That was why she was so devoted to him!</p>
<p>The fond memories from her childhood, coupled with the lack of care in her later life, were cherished forever in her subconscious. They had even been magnified to an image she herself had created. But the original memory of this body had become weakened since Yu Yaoyao had taken over it.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao has been using her familiarity with the plot of the novel to overcome the difficulties. As a reader, she really didn’t understand that Chen Jiao’s unattainable person was not Ling Shuang, but the original owner of this body!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was speechless. “Oh my God, what a plot twist…” she managed to whisper to herself.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Shen Yichong said as he looked up and stretched out a hand to wipe the sauce from the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao coughed, “Oh, it’s nothing. Darling, I’m just thinking about the plot in my script…”</p>
<p>It was better not to tell Shen Yichong about this matter. She wasn’t quite sure if her guess was correct.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pressed a hand to her forehead as her heart raced.</p>
<p>In the original novel, she never saw any plot that connected Chen Jiao with the original owner of the body. She had also once guessed that the original heroine, Ling Shuang, was working secretly with Yu Xinjie. And was Little Bun’s death really an accident?</p>
<p>The author of this book had never clarified these things, even at the end.</p>
<p>Many readers had scolded the heroine and the female supporting role of this book for being cheap and bitchy. The majority of the commenters were complaining, saying that the author had skewed values and morals.</p>
<p>The book had ended hastily, and it had only briefly explained what seemed to be the ending of HIM.</p>
<p>Now that Yu Yaoyao thought about it, she thought that this author was really… What a terrible ending!</p>
<p>How toxic!</p>
<p>The author and the novel were both toxic!</p>
<p>Looking back, Ling Shuang as the imposter had not been a good choice. The girl was not just a little badass; she had been the big boss all along. She had been even more scheming that Yu Xinjie, who had been creating havoc on the frontline!</p>
<p>Brother Chen Jiao, the guy that had seen the poisonous little flower as a treasure, had indirectly killed his real unattainable person, and finally married the sister, who was a sinner…</p>
<p>God! She couldn’t even begin to point out all the crazy subplots!</p>
<p>Was Chen Jiao a fool? Hadn’t he just made a big joke of himself?</p>
<p>Originally, Yu Yaoyao had felt that the most tragic and stupid character was the original owner of her body. But looking at it now, it seemed that Chen Jiao was an idiot, tragic character all along! Had he found out the truth, seeing how he had spoken to her today? Would he fall apart if he knew the whole truth?</p>
