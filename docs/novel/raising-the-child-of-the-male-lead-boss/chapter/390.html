<p><strong>Chapter 373</strong><u></u></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>After “Chaos” had been out for two weeks, the Box Office data on it was calculated. In the first week it reached 1.2 billion. As a large-scale historical film, it was not as thrilling as an action film, nor as funny as romantic comedy films. So, the grossing data for it was considered a fairly great result.</p>
<p>But the results for the second week were even more surprising. “Chaos” reached 1.8 billion, beating every other commercial film in the same period. In its second week, it rose to rank second out of similar films.</p>
<p>The cumulative Box Office results reached 100 million over the course of the two weeks, and a large part of the audience was amazed by Yu Yaoyao’s debut on the big screen.</p>
<p>Many people who weren’t her fans before, and even theatre audiences who hadn’t watched the variety shows, were all interested in her beautiful, expressive face. Many film critics praised the magnificent scenes, beautiful pictures and compact plots, and there was plenty of praise for Yu Yaoyao:</p>
<p><em>[Is this the Internet celebrity Yu Yaoyao? Her performance is shocking!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I have not paid attention to the influencers, but I’m really impressed!]</em></p>
<p><em>[A person who can perfectly express the mood of a girl and a woman, even in death. Very superb acting!]</em></p>
<p><em>[YYY is really a surprise! Looking forward to more of her works!]</em></p>
<p>With these favorable comments on the Internet, Yu Yaoyao’s commercial value was constantly improving; just like the head of Guangxin’s business department had said.</p>
<p>The daily invitations to endorsements, sponsorships, and even companies’ annual meetings made the little girl in the business department sick of phone calls. Not to mention the various scripts and variety show invitations Ni Yi had received.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao was previously promoted through hunger marketing. Since people have seen her work on the big screen, her popularity has increased. But I think this is just consuming her future popularity prematurely. The next big screen works, or TV series on the small screen, will never be able to go as big as ‘Queen of the Prosperity’ and ‘Chaos’.” This particular conversation was being had by a suit-wearing, bald man in an Audi parked in a parking lot.</p>
<p>As he spoke, a trace of jealousy flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>During the whole conversation, he was also very vigilant. From time to time, he looked to see if there was anyone passing by outside his window.</p>
<p>“Mr. Xu Hong, are you saying that I shouldn’t make additional investments in her?” The voice speaking through the earpiece belonged to no one else but the actor Chen Jiao. He chuckled as he said, “I think you are misunderstanding something. I wouldn’t invest in her, even if you’d told me not to. Mr. Shen would not allow me to share in the profit. So, you don’t have to worry about that. I just want to hear what other interesting projects you have from today’s investment meeting. Like are there other valuable, or potential projects that Mr. Shen wants all of you to follow up?” He spoke in a way that was so convincing, that it was nearly bewitching.</p>
<p>Xu Hong’s old face twitched at his words. “Yes, of course there is. Yu Yaoyao’s value will wear out one day. After the public is tired of her beauty, they will look for a more fresh, pure style. Such a style was once popular. When the public’s taste changes, it will be popular again!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao took a deep breath once Xu Hong had finished speaking. “A girl who can still be called pure and innocent… Is it…?”</p>
<p>Xu Hong didn’t explain. “Brother Jiao, the two of us are now…”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao chuckled lightly, “Of course, we’re friends with the same thoughts. I followed you and invested in “Allure” once before, and I have now added another 10 million Yuan. When I have a return, I will remember you as a friend. Let’s play by the old rule. I will give you 1% of my profit if there’s any, but I want you to invest your capital with me as well. Let’s get straight to the point.”</p>
<p>Xu Hong’s eyes lit up, pushing away his frustrations at being scolded every time he attended investment meetings. “At today’s meeting, we discussed a total of 20 scripts. Among them are two works by Gu Qianqian, the heroine of “Chaos”; a play that performed well this time. There was also a web drama adapted from a network novel, “Oriental Fantasy”, “President of Love”, themes of emergency doctors. We still have to follow up on the other dozen scripts and decide what to invest in next week.”</p>
<p>“Gu Qianqian?” Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>“Yes, she almost hasn’t had any failed projects since her debut. She’s only one step away from being the best actress. If ‘Chaos’ goes smoothly and pushes her to the nomination for the best actress award, or even other awards, her next film will definitely be very popular!” Xu Hong said with certainty. “In her next two movies, one of her roles is that of a teacher in the mountain area. She would be the second female lead. Although it is an art film, the theme is very down to earth, and it will obviously be supported by the Ministry of Education. The other is a comedy, where she has just been cast to be the female lead. From past Box Office records, this is the theme that has always easily won the championship. Even if she does not win the best actress award, the results from Box Office will be great. Tomorrow, we are going to discuss investments with the producer for the comedy,” he paused after he finished speaking.</p>
<p>He was disclosing the company’s confidential information. If he was found out, his dismissal would be a light penalty, but he would most likely be subjected to civil penalties as well. But when he thought back to how Shen Yichong had scolded him at the meeting, how the man hadn’t even cared about his dignity, he couldn’t help but want to teach him a lesson.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow? Who is the director?” Chen Jiao asked. He had a good feeling about this.</p>
