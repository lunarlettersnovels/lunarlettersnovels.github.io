            <p><strong>Chapter 433</strong></p>
<p>Little Bun repeated the number three times, and everyone in the venue could hear it clearly. And not only that, even everyone in the live broadcast room recorded the phone numbers.</p>
<p><em>[Hehehe, if I call that number, can I talk to Little Bun?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I also noted it! Perfect!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Hehe, Mr. Shen is estimated to be getting a headache!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen: My son’s homework is obviously far from enough, increase his homework load!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I want to invest! Let’s do crowdfunding to invest in a short film for the little baby!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Shen Rui: Because my little sister is about to be born, I need to earn milk powder money for her in advance. I also need money for her beautiful skirts~ Daddy is not good enough, the family can only rely on me~]</em></p>
<p><em>[Ni Yi: What happened? Why am I getting so many calls!]</em></p>
<p><em>The YY fans in the live broadcast room were all laughing and joking. They were completely excited.</em></p>
<p>Even passers-by thought that Little Bun was very interesting. There were also many fans from the other artists who were thinking to now be a fan of his. It was unprecedented to have a child of an artist to speak on behalf of his mother at this kind of award ceremony. But fortunately, Little Bun was considered sensible. After saying the number, he took the initiative to say goodbye to Uncle Qi Hang.</p>
<p>“I’m going to see if my little sister is out. Uncle, you can call back later for a chat!</p>
<p>Qi Hang was stunned for a second. He still wanted to chat?</p>
<p>“Okay. Go, good boy. See you later.” Qi Hang also said bye to Little Bun. Little Bun even politely waited for Qi Hang to hang up first.</p>
<p>In the comment section, people were commenting that seeing Little Bun made them want to give birth to a son. The fans who didn’t know him were asking if he had ever been on TV before, and if there’s any videos they could watch. The YY fans immediately showed them the way to watch Yaoyao’s new and old variety shows.</p>
<p>The awards ceremony soon continued.</p>
<p>But at this moment in the hospital, Ni Yi, who was walking back and forth, quickly discovered something was wrong.</p>
<p>Just now, he went out to answer a phone call from the company. Then, he went to the corner to confirm that Yu Yaoyao’s award-winning testimonial video was intact. Finally, he returned to the door of the delivery room and waited with Little Bun.</p>
<p>However, his cell phone started ringing just a minute after he came back. Ni Yi looked down and found that it was from an unknown caller. He frowned and went to the corner to pick it up.</p>
<p>“Hello? Hi, is this Mr. Ni Yi? Are you Yaoyao’s manager?” It was a girl’s voice that sounded a little timid.</p>
<p>This phone of Ni Yi was specifically for work.</p>
<p>He immediately answered, “Hello, I am. You are…? If there’s any work appointments, please…”</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, there was a scream with excitement on the other end of the phone, almost smashing his eardrums.</p>
<p>“Sister, sister!! This is the phone number of Yaoyao’s manager, ahhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Brother Ni, is our Yaoyao giving birth now?”</p>
<p>“Are you in the hospital? Where’s our baby?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was dumbfounded. Why did this sound wrong? This didn’t sound like a call for work?</p>
<p>“Which baby?”</p>
<p>How did she know that Yaoyao was giving birth to a baby? Ni Yi was at a loss.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao suddenly said that her stomach hurt when they were all watching the live broadcast of the awards ceremony at Shen Yichong’s house. Then, the group quickly rushed to the hospital.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was so busy that he was sweating profusely. There were many reporters waiting nearby, and he needed to stop them with the security guards to prevent them from entering the hospital. He was finally getting a break now, so he didn’t know what happened during the live broadcast.</p>
<p>“Our Baby Rui!” The female voice on the other end of the phone got even more excited. “Can you let me talk to him? Please, please!”</p>
<p>“What..” Ni Yi’s scalp went numb suddenly.</p>
<p>Was this a fan?</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I’m afraid it’s not convenient. We are all in the hospital. Please contact me later. Thank you for your concern.”</p>
<p>After politely rejecting her request, he then said goodbye to the other party and hung up the phone.</p>
<p>“What happened? Is it possible that someone has leaked my phone number? Looks like it’s someone’s relative?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi frowned and muttered. He shook his head and walked back to the waiting area for the family members, but his phone rang again before he even sat down on the stool.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was taken aback. He picked up the call immediately.</p>
<p>“Ni Yi? Our Baby Rui asked to call you on this number. Is he there? Could you please pass him the phone? Please!”</p>
<p>Here we go again!</p>
<p>Ni Yi looked down and saw that it was a different caller ID! “Xiao Rui asked you to call?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes!”</p>
<p>“Um… I’m sorry, he’s not here. I’ll hang up first since I have something on. Thank you for your concern.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi hung up again.</p>
<p>He thought to himself that the fans these days were so smart. How did they know his number?</p>
<p>He turned his head and glanced at Little Bun who was sitting obediently on a seat outside of the delivery room, looking worried and nervous. Then, he shook his head. How could he blame a child for the phone calls he got?</p>
<p>Xiao Rui was obviously here, and he was very well-behaved. How was it possible that he was the one who got people to call him?</p>
<p>Ni Yi felt that the fans were a little out of control! They wanted to put the blame on the others when they weren’t even well-behaved!</p>
<p>And when he wanted to enter the live broadcast room to take a look at the awarding situation, he saw a comment, “Congratulations to Yaoyao for winning the best supporting actress award”…</p>
<p>The corners of his mouth rose instantly. He was about to share this joy with Little Bun and Shen Lin who were present, but his phone rang again in less than half a second!</p>
<p>“Mr. Ni Yi? I’m looking for Shen Rui?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi frowned! Again!?</p>
