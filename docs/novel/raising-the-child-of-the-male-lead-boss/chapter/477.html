<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 286 – Follies of Youth (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>She acted out the scene with the casting director. She took care of her expressions, which was muddled first, and she burst into tears when she was woken up. She did everything according to the storyline. She didn’t need to look at the script because she had memorized every line.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said the Director, “Cut.”</p>
<p>Director Ma looked elated. “Shuang, you really understood the script thoroughly,” he said approvingly, “Your reactions seemed real and natural. Excellent job!”</p>
<p>He asked for the opinions of the scriptwriter and the casting director, both of whom seemed very impressed at her acting. They commended her for taking the time to memorize the script. “The youthfulness that you portrayed was very convincing,” the casting director said, “The innocent complexity of a young girl was clear in your acting.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang thanked them. She had practiced her expressions and reaction in front of the mirror countless times. She was glad her hard work hadn’t gone to waste. She had worked extra hard when she knew of Shen Yichong attending the audition. Maybe he was impressed too. She lifted her head to look at Shen Yichong, and her gaze fell on Yu Yaoyao. She was sure that the youthfulness she portrayed could never be expressed by a married woman with a child. She smiled smugly.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, Mrs. Shen,” said the Director, “What are your opinions?”</p>
<p>“I have a different opinion,” said Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“I object,” said Yu Yaoyao at the same time.</p>
<p>Director Ma was surprised. He had asked for their opinions out of politeness. He didn’t really think Shen Yichong would have any suggestions on the acting; he was just a businessman, not an artist. Yu Yaoyao was a different matter. She was a successful, formidable actress.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s confidence wavered. She ignored Yu Yaoyao and looked at Shen Yichong with hope. “Mr. Shen,” she said, “I would be delighted to hear any differing opinions that could improve my performance.”</p>
<p>Director Ma looked doubtful. However, Shen Yichong seeing Yu Yaoyao practically jumping in her seat with her hands raised like an elementary kid couldn’t hold back his smile. “Well, if you don’t mind,” he said, “I will let Yu speak first.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Yu Yaoyao immediately, “The scene felt a little off. It wasn’t very convincing.”</p>
<p>Director Ma was stunned. He opened his mouth, then closed it again. He never expected anyone to give criticism so boldly. She was indeed an accomplished actress and qualified to give feedback. “Mrs. Shen,” he said, “Have you even read the script?”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang was seething in anger. <em>How dare she? She can’t just denounce my acting because of personal prejudice! </em>She was visibly shaking.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Shen,” said Director Ma, “The scene is on page 36, if you could just—,”</p>
<p>“Call me ‘Yu Yaoyao’, if you don’t mind,” said Yu Yaoyao, “And I don’t need to read the script.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang gritted her teeth and looked at Director Ma. The Director frowned. “Mrs. Yu Yaoyao,” he said, “Do you have any other actress in mind? The suitability would depend on the script itself.”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” Yu Yaoyao said, “Miss Ling has already explained Summer’s journey for me right before the scene.” She looked directly at Ling Shuang. “Before Summer comes to her senses, wasn’t she in the darkness with no hope for anyone or anything?” she asked, “Summer feels like her world has ended. So, Summer would look desolate and hopeless. But the youthful vitality and vigour in your acting told a completely different story.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang froze. The casting director let out an ‘ah’ in realization of this. Ling Shuang, in order to impress, had focused more on the character’s youthfulness instead of her hopelessness.</p>
<p>“That was what I was thinking as well,” said Shen Yichong, “I thought the character didn’t look desolate enough considering what she has been through. Despair is important to portray the transformation from naivety to maturity powerfully. The scene did not evoke it.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s confidence was gone. She felt so angry that she felt like her eyes would lose focus. She gritted her teeth in anger. “Mrs. Shen,” she said with mock respect, “You are a very proficient actress. Please provide me a small demonstration, if you would be so kind. So that I can gauge where I went wrong.”</p>
