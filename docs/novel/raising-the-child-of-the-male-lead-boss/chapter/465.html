<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, though, had become a lot more sensible. She reached the hotel where the meeting for the script-reading was supposed to happen. Even Ni Yi could see that she had become more serious about her job. Usually, she would have slept or watched some Korean Drama in the nanny car. But not today, she had read the book on professional acting throughout the journey, making notes and highlighting important parts.</p>
<p>She seemed a little sad when they reached their destination. “So soon?” she said, “I haven’t even finished a part of this theory.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi smiled. “It’s alright, sis,” he said, “The theoretical knowledge is usually hard to grasp. No need to rush to understand it.” He glanced at the assistant in the seat next to him. Xiao Xiaoxiang immediately stepped out to help Yu Yaoyao. She tidied Yu Yaoyao’s bangs and straightened her dress before she got out of the car.</p>
<p>“Sis, Brother Wei Ming is playing your ex in the drama,” explained Ni Yi, “You already know him. Ask him any questions you have. Today, you will be following the director’s instructions in everything. But if you can’t ask the director regarding any doubts you have, you can ask Wei Ming. I have already talked with him.”</p>
<p>Wei Ming had played the male lead of the play Yu Yaoyao was in: ‘Queen of the Flourishing Age’. It had been her very first play. She had had to play an intimate scene with him. They hadn’t had contact since then. But Wei Ming had a good impression of her and had also provided very positive feedback on Yu Yaoyao’s acting. After Ni Yi was finished explaining things to her, she carried a small bag and walked to the conference room in the hotel.</p>
<p>“Sis, I will take care of your luggage,” said Ni Yi, “I will book a room for you and leave them there. After you are done with the meeting, I will show you to the room.” Ni Yi also forwarded Shen Yichong and Shen Rui’s suggestions and advice from this morning to her phone. He had apparently made notes.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao thanked him and assured him that there was nothing to worry about and proceeded to the meeting. She had arrived pretty early than the designated time, but the Director and Wei Ming were already there.</p>
<p>Wei Ming waved at her as she approached. “Yaoyao!” he said, “This time you are my ‘wife’ again. It must be fate. Here, sit next to me.” He greeted her with a smile and gave her a bottle of water. “How is your progress with the script? I heard you just got it a week ago. Let me know if I can help with anything. Our scenes are against each other anyway.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hugged her bag and turned away from him. She was half a step away from him with a solemn face. “You cheat!” she said angrily, “Why did you do this?”</p>
<p>Wei Ming was speechless. Yu Yaoyao raised her small face, full of pain and doubt and looked at him. “You left your wife and your children just so you could have fun somewhere else,” she said angrily, “What about me? How can you call yourself a human being?” She pushed the bottle of water away from her. “I don’t want your water, give it to your mistress.”</p>
<p>Wei Ming looked stunned. Director Qi Hang burst out laughing. “That’s good!” he said, “Yaoyao is already absorbed in her character. Wei Ming should indeed be seated with his mistress.” He chuckled.</p>
<p>Wei Ming smiled. “Oh yes,” he said, “Where is my mistress?” He said looking around, jokingly. Qi Hang was laughing, and Wei Ming was touching his nose helplessly. Yu Yaoyao laughed too.</p>
<p>She turned to Wei Ming. “Brother Wei,” she said, “I do admire your acting.”</p>
<p>Wei Ming smiled and waved his hand. “You flatter me,” he said, “Mr. Shen will teach me a lesson for that. I am safer if you hate me. I am actually a bad guy in the drama anyway.” He joked.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao laughed. “He just sent me a message,” she said looking at her phone, “Told me not to get started unless the Director says to start.’</p>
<p>Everyone laughed at that. “He really does know you very well,” said Wei Ming.</p>
<p>After a while, the actors arrived slowly. Director Qi hang did the honor of introductions. “Female lead, sis Cai Fang,” he said indicating the actors, “male lead, Brother Lu Cheng….”</p>
<p>The drama was focused on family ethics. The female lead and the male lead are married but are suffering a mid-life crisis. Their marriage and their work are in jeopardy. While the second female and second male lead are also married, but the husband betrays the wife and the family of three suffers a blow from this. The drama puts special focus on the female lead and the second female lead who, after trying to mend their broken lives, find their own value by supporting each other.</p>
<p>“Well, then,” said Director Qi Hang, “Let’s get started and follow the reading in sequence. If you have any problems, please feel free to raise them with me. The assistants will read the part of the narrators for now.”</p>
<p>They all sat around a round table and started the session. One of the members of the crew recorded the session on his phone. This was for updating the progress of the shoot and for marketing. People enjoyed the ‘behind-the-scenes’ as much as they enjoyed the movies. Many young actors opt out from the script reading process as they have other matters to attend to. Some may be spokesperson to many brands, and therefore busy. While others requested to be absent from script-reading because it didn’t bring much exposure for them.</p>
<p>As days passed by, many crews eventually gave up. But senior artists called on various crews to pay attention and pick up the reading sessions again. The reading sessions were indeed very important because it paved the path for smoother acting on the main shooting day. It also deepened the understanding of the actors regarding their roles and characters.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao diligently did her part as well. She listened carefully to everyone present reading the script. She read her part very professionally as well. Her phone on the table vibrated. Several texts popped up along with a few voice messages:</p>
<p><strong>[Sis, mom said you must come home for dinner today! If you don’t, don’t blame me and mom for getting upset and doing irrational things! Actresses must also be filial to their parents. You can’t just abandon your family after marrying a rich man.]</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao clicked on the ‘translate to text’ button near the voice messages so she won’t disrupt the reading. The texts were all about calling her home for dinner. She rolled her eyes. <em>Go home, my ass! </em>She turned off her screen. For five years, her stepmother had never asked her to dinner, not even when she was sending money to them. Now that she stopped giving them money and maintained her distance, she was being called home for dinner. She seethed in rage.</p>
