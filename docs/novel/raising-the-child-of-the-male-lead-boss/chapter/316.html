            <p><strong>Chapter 447</strong></p>
<p>Chen Jiao was shocked by the candid thoughts of his heart. He did so much just to get praised? Was he… a fool?! Without a doubt, he was a complete fool!</p>
<p>And now that he thought about it, he felt that he was extremely stupid.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was worth more than 100 million Yuan. Whether it was connections, qualifications, vision, and funds, he was well-known in the industry. As an actor who had only been popular for several years, how could he be able to beat him? Even the real estate giant Wansheng Group had given up fighting against Guangxin. Yet, he was still barking at the wrong tree! And what could be the benefits of fighting against Shen Yichong?</p>
<p>Chen Jiao felt dizzy, He wanted to win over Yu Yaoyao before. This time, he even came only for Yu Yaoyao. But… she had given birth to Shen Yichong’s second child, and she just got out of confinement! Wasn’t this enough to prove that the husband and wife were still in a good relationship? What was he still messing around for?</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s face was as white as paper! Shen Yichong also turned his head and paused in his step because of his outburst. It was just that Shen Yichong’s face and expression were twisted, as if he had heard something unthinkable.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? You don’t want to be free?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao suddenly didn’t know what to say. Why did he sound like he was scolding him for being so cheap!?</p>
<p>But recently, he has done so many things against Shen Yichong. Thinking about it carefully, all his actions were indeed to make Shen Yichong regret his choice. Regret that he didn’t cultivate him well at the time, and even gave up on him in the end? Of course, Shen Yichong snatching Yu Yaoyao away was also a very important factor.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong, who was standing in the corridor, merely raised an eyebrow, “Go to bed. It’s late, and you should go back tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao felt his chest become tight for a moment. This person just never listened to him! Then what was he doing in his room? Every time, he would stir up the conversation, and leave without making things clear!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong obviously did not intend to continue talking with him. Now that Chen Jiao had established his own studio, there was no point in discussing the right and wrong of the past. Everyone must continue to move forward.</p>
<p>Moreover, Chen Jiao had been rekindling his love for Yu Yaoyao, and Shen Yichong obviously did not want to have a close friendship with a man who tried to hook up his wife. Continued to be friends so Shen Yichong could invite him over to chase his own wife in the future? Shen Yichong directly killed this possibility!</p>
<p>While Shen Yichong left without looking back, Chen Jiao was so depressed that he could vomit blood. He felt that he was going to be suffocated to death by the unspoken words in his heart.</p>
<p>He stayed in the corridor and did not go back to his room for a long time. After all, he wouldn’t be able to sleep anyway if he went back to the room. But not long after he was standing in a daze in the corridor, the door to a room opened with a creak. A small black head cautiously poked out after a while.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao came back to his senses when he heard the sound from behind. Whether it’s the crew of the program or Gu Qianqian, he obviously didn’t want to face them now. He immediately turned around, lowered his head, and walked back to his room while looking at the ground.</p>
<p>However, his downcast gaze coincided with the short-legged Little Bun’s gaze! Chen Jiao was immediately embarrassed and nodded at the boy that acted mean to him. He raised his foot and was ready to leave.</p>
<p>But Little Bun opened his mouth unexpectedly. “Uncle Gangster, you can’t sleep either?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyelids jumped wildly. He persuaded himself not to mess with the kid before pulling out a reluctant smile. “Yes.”</p>
<p>He didn’t pause his steps. But soon, Little Bun sighed heavily behind him. Chen Jiao’s scalp felt numb; he was already freaked out enough by the kid from this afternoon!</p>
<p>Little did he expect, a childish voice would sound behind him when he was about to open the door of his room.</p>
<p>“Uncle Gangster..I’m sorry.”</p>
<p><em>‘Huh?’ </em>Chen Jiao’s hand hovered over the doorknob. He looked back in surprise. He saw Little Bun Shen Rui with bulging cheeks, his dark eyes staring at him. Little Bun’s face was pinkish, and his two little hands were pinching the pajamas at the side.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t sleep just now, and I overheard you talking to daddy,” the little bun said. Chen Jiao was taken aback.</p>
<p>“I didn’t overhear it deliberately, but you guys spoke a little loudly.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s mouth twitched. “Go to sleep, kid. Is there something you want to do other than sleep?”</p>
<p>“I miss my mommy and my little sister, so I can’t sleep. Are you also suffering from insomnia?”</p>
<p>Little Bun did not plan to leave. Instead, he walked a few steps towards Chen Jiao. He reached out his hand and wanted to pat on Chen Jiao’s back. After finding that he was not tall enough, he gave up. But he still raised his head and glanced at Chen Jiao sympathetically.</p>
<p>“Uncle Gangste.. I didn’t like you before because my mommy said you always like to mess things up,” the little bun began. “But I just heard you talking to my daddy… Uncle, you seemed pretty miserable… My daddy is very fierce, I understand.”</p>
<p>Little Bun raised his clear black eyes as if he could empathize.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, I also thought about cutting off my relationship with my daddy. He behaves like that sometimes. It’s annoying.”</p>
<p>Little Bun’s acted as if he understood.</p>
<p>He looked at Chen Jiao, “But my daddy would not give in if you provoked him in a hard way. If you were to fight with him, you would only get your a*s smacked in the end.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao: “…”</p>
<p>He was no longer a kid. How would he get his ass smacked!</p>
