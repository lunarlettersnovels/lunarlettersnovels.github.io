            <p><strong>Chapter 407</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was now rich. Everyone knew that.</p>
<p>Wei Ming was speechless when she said what she did. He was there to be a guest; he couldn’t understand why the mother and son were acting like this. It wasn’t until then that he was reminded that she might be the most valuable person in the industry now, and she was married to a man who was a major investor.</p>
<p>“Well… Yeah. I was just telling you what I know. I don’t know the specifics.” Wei Ming wiped his sweat.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded and said, “I’ll ask Xiao Sisi myself.”</p>
<p>She didn’t think too much about it before she continued to ask Wei Ming to share all kinds of jokes and gossip.</p>
<p>Wei Ming had just reached the point where he’d rather die than continue, when Shen Yichong reappeared after finishing his conference call.</p>
<p>Wei Ming was relieved. If Shen Yichong were to ask him to clean up the guest room, he would instantly go without any complaints.</p>
<p>After Lu Cheng finished washing the dishes, he consciously went to the backyard to do some weeding. There was nothing more uncomfortable than being forced to share jokes with Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>The two men didn’t even want their screen time now. They just wanted to be left alone.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu felt a headache coming on when he saw only the family was left in the living room.</p>
<p>After Wei Ming left, Yu Yaoyao didn’t ask Shen Yichong to tell her more stories and jokes. Instead, she asked him about Da Fu. “Darling, why didn’t Xiao Sisi tell me that she’s facing trouble? Why didn’t she come to me knowing that her husband was short on money?” Her heart was all knotted up at the thought.</p>
<p>This was the relationship between humans.</p>
<p>There was nothing best friends couldn’t talk about. She began to look forward to having this kind of friendship.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong covered her with a blanket and stuffed a cushion behind her. “She maybe doesn’t even know about it. And if she does, it must be hard for her to talk about.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Yu Yaoyao blinked. “Ah… Men are prideful.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. “Da Fu previously refused to star in a few big production roles, and he wanted to become a behind-the-scenes director instead. Many people in the industry were not too optimistic about that choice of his. Now that he is encountering difficulties in his first movie, I have no doubt he is under immense pressure. He has always been stubborn and independent. He’s not one to ask for help, even if he is facing troubles.”</p>
<p>“Will he sacrifice everything to prove himself?” Yu Yaoyao blew out her cheeks.</p>
<p>This kind of methodology didn’t sit right with her. Life was so short and fragile. There were more than 100 ways to die, and people faced unknown threats every day. What was the point of trying to prove oneself?</p>
<p>Staying alive was what was important! Being comfortable was the best! Only if one was alive could they prove themselves.</p>
<p>And in addition to this, this guy had to take care of his wife and child. What was the use of being stubborn?</p>
<p>“No. This won’t do. I’m calling Xiao Sisi!” Yu Yaoyao shot to her feet.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong jumped up to support her. “Finish your milk.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao reluctantly drank it, while holding out her hand to her husband.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong immediately handed her the phone.</p>
<p>The live broadcast was still recording. Everyone was shocked to see Mr. Shen’s actions.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen showed meticulous care in every move he made. He already knew what his wife wanted before she asked for it.</p>
<p><em>[The boss goes home and becomes a dog…Who would have thought?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I thought I saw Mr. Shen’s tail wagging!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen: How dare Da Fu make my wife worry? My wife should only be worried about me! Not even milk can distract her now.]</em></p>
<p>The people in the live broadcast room were entertaining themselves by making all kinds of jokes.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao finished her milk in one gulp and handed the empty cup to Shen Yichong. Then she got up from the sofa and called Xiao Sisi.</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room could see her going up to the second floor, and Shen Yichong, who was carefully following behind her, ready to support her at any time.</p>
<p>After he escorted her to the room, he turned around in relief.</p>
<p>The fans in the live broadcast room were now a little surer about their previous speculations.</p>
<p>Was Yaoyao really pregnant?</p>
<p>Mr. Shen being so nervous didn’t look right at all!</p>
<p>But the paparazzies merely said that he was ill, and that he was infertile…There was no news that mentioned Yu Yaoyao’s pregnancy.</p>
<p>Bullshit paparazzies!</p>
<p>The longer the fans watched the live broadcast, the more they felt the paparazzies were being ridiculous!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao really did seem to be pregnant with a second baby.</p>
<p>When they watched Wei Ming gossiping with Yu Yaoyao just now, they couldn’t help but laugh. Now that they thought about it, they felt it was actually a very important message!</p>
<p><em>[Do you guys remember what Baby Rui said just now? He said he would read story books every day while Mr. Shen was in charge of keeping Yaoyao happy. The former indicated prenatal education, while the goal of the latter is to keep the pregnant women in a good mood, right?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Did anyone notice that Mr. Shen barely had meat during his dinner? He was mostly eating vegetables. When I was pregnant, my husband also didn’t have much of an appetite because he was so nervous.]</em></p>
<p><em>[I watched all the unedited versions of ‘Wife’ back then. Mr. Shen never asked Yaoyao to drink milk… Now that has all changed. What do you guys think?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Our Yaoyao didn’t have a single snack since the start of the broadcast… Can you guys believe that?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I just noticed our Yaoyao’s belly is bulging a little. I thought her stomach had expanded because she’d eaten too much.]</em></p>
<p>Everyone’s speculations were now in full swing.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had no idea that the truth had been discovered. She finally got in touch with Xiao Sisi.</p>
<p>Her husband was indeed short on investment funds, and the project had been stagnated. They also couldn’t start making the special effects as they had no funds to start with. But Xiao Sisi hadn’t wanted to ask Yu Yaoyao for help when it came to money.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, this is not about money. The investors are not optimistic about his project. Why would the project be lacking funding otherwise? He will just have to face reality. The probability of being successful on the first project as a director is quite low. He doesn’t need to chase such a difficult goal. He could just start with an easier one. You can’t reach the sky in just one step.”</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao had other ideas. “Show me the script. I’ll show my husband.”</p>
