<p><strong>Chapter 317 – Slave Husband (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t even need to think, “If you want to run a beauty salon, I will get Chen Lin to find a good location downtown. I will also ask him to get experts in for the decoration, equipment, and staff to manage the project,” in other words, he didn’t even care about the shop that was run by Zhao Mei.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao understood the implied meaning, “Yes, we want the money. Darling, is this because he wants to fool me? It was said to only take three days. And another thing, where is the promised apology?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong gently stroked her head and handed her a drumstick, “I will let Chen Lin manage it. The apology will be released tonight,” as he was talking, his phone started ringing. He glanced at the caller ID before picking up, “Li Tao, what’s the matter?” he paused as he listened, “Well I’m off work now.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong wasn’t exactly sure what the other party wanted, but after he’d listened for a little while longer, he frowned. “You want me to meet up for a drink? I’m not coming, I’m busy,” then he hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao took a bite of the drumstick and blinked. She pursed her oily lips and said, “Li Tao? Is that pudding Xiao Taotao?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded as he refilled her bowl with more chicken soup.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes immediately narrowed, “He wants to meet up with you?” after careful recall, they had never seen each other again after the last pudding advertisement. She still remembered that Shen Yichong said that Xiao Taotao was his friend, and that she could bring home as much pudding as she liked. Unfortunately, they didn’t stay in contact after the shooting was finished. The pudding and biscuits that had been sent to her were finished long ago.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately became interested, “Why does he want to meet you today? You guys haven’t seen each other lately.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a paper towel and wiped the corners of her mouth, “Before this, he had just taken over his father’s position, and he was busy with the company’s affair. His schedule only recently cleared up. When he heard about what happened, he asked about the situation, seeing as his family is also a big customer of Yu Jianghai.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hesitated before she said, “I see,” and she did understand. When she realized her soup had been refilled, she lowered her head and took another mouthful. Once she’d swallowed, she spoke again, “Xiao Taotao isn’t bad at all. He cares about me. Tell him I appreciate his concern. I just want to know when their small puddings will have new flavors. Our son and I have been waiting for so long. I mean, look at the chip manufacturer, for example. I heard they are mailing me two boxes of their two new flavors. The puddings are too slow! As a spokesperson, this makes me a little anxious!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, “I will let him know,” he picked up his phone and sent a rather short message to Li Tao.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long until Li Tao, after failing to invite Shen Yichong for a drink, got the latest news on Weibo. It came from Yu Yaoyao’s makeup artist from the crew of ‘Seven Years Itch.’ She had sent a picture of the dressing room to a friend, who had posted in on Weibo. And just like a bomb, it sparked heated discussions.</p>
<p>The photo in question did not include the face of any artist or actor, but it did capture two small wooden tables in the corner. They were covered in various sized bottles, cans, and cute lunch boxes. Pasted on the bottles and cans were little notes that read:</p>
<p># Herbal tea (For the throat, after crying scene)</p>
<p># Pear juice (Before meal)</p>
<p># Milk (Requires heating)</p>
<p>#Chinese date &amp; wolfberry (After meal)</p>
<p># Lemon juice (After four o’clock in the afternoon)</p>
<p># Sparkling Water (Three times in a day)</p>
<p>Then, on the lunch boxes:</p>
<p># Egg roll (After the first scene in the afternoon)</p>
<p># Cut apples (After the first scene in the afternoon)</p>
<p># Mango (After lunch)</p>
<p># Small glutinous rice dumplings (Only give when hungry, only one at a time)</p>
<p>Netizens were shocked by the meticulousness of these notes.</p>
<p>The makeup artist did not directly reveal the artist’s name. It was only mentioned in the chatlog that these were personally prepared by a popular actress’ husband. The affection of the husband for his wife, combined with the careful preparations by no ordinary work assistant, made the group of netizens scream with jealousy.</p>
<p>When Li Tao saw the post, there were already a lot of comments.</p>
<p><em>[Looking at the outline of the handwriting, it is quite domineering!]</em></p>
<p><em>[My husband cannot even be one-tenth of this person… I’m jealous!]</em></p>
<p><em>[How lucky is this actress!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I find the note that says, ‘Only give when hungry,’ funny. This style of writing… Looks familiar!]</em></p>
<p>Li Tao wasn’t paying attention at first, he was just casually scrolling on Weibo. But as soon as he reached these few comments, he stopped. Immediately, he scrolled back and enlarged the picture. Then he looked carefully at the writing on the labels.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw the handwriting, he said, “Damn! Isn’t this Brother Yichong’s writing?” he was just refused a drink by Brother Yichong because he was busy.</p>
<p>Li Tao could not help but smile bitterly after looking at the labels. He had to wonder<em>, Is that dude going to be a slave for his wife? No wonder he has no time!</em> He was struck with the sudden feeling that there was no humanity when the opposite sex was involved!</p>
<p>Lately, Li Tao had been busy as there had been a lot going on. He usually only got into bed after midnight. After all his busy days, the spokesperson of their group had suddenly fallen into a family dispute. Out of loyalty as Shen Yichong’s brother and his appreciation for Yu Yaoyao, he had even asked the marketing department to speak up for her.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it had now proved his thoughts right.</p>
<p>Now, at the most important time, he wanted to invite Brother Yichong out for a drink to convey his message to his sister-in-law to put her more at ease. He’d wanted to tell her that his whole company team would stand by her side and support her. He could even support her as a friend and cut off the relationship with the Yu’s.</p>
<p>He never expected Brother Chong to turn him down by saying, “I’m busy,” before he could even finish his sentence.</p>
<p>“Brother Chong would rather do this than… drink with me?” Li Tao stared blankly at the bottles and lunch boxes in the picture.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to complain, he received a text message:</p>
<p><em>Your sister-in-law said she appreciates your concern. In addition, the production of new small pudding flavors is too slow. Lay’s has mailed her the new flavors. Please work harder!</em></p>
<p>As soon as read he’d the message, Li Tao jumped up exclaiming, “Damn, Brother Chong! He is indeed a slave to his wife, he cannot be saved. I…I’ll expose you to the netizens!” he rolled up his sleeves and created another account called, ‘Bro is a Slave for Wife.’ Then, he rushed to the comments and started his revenge:</p>
<p><em>[Number one slave for wife, Mr. Shen. Give it a thought, everyone.]</em></p>
<p>This single comment made the comment section boil.</p>
