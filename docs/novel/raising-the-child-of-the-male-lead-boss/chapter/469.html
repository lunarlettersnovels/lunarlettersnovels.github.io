            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 294 – Adore (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>On the day of the show, many celebrities were invited but the chief designer for ADORE, James and president for China branch, George had an eye out for Yu Yaoyao. Eventually, they saw a very beautiful woman walk to the seats on the front row. She took a seat and grabbed a book from her bag and began reading. James and George were stunned, as were the designers and other celebrities.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody could accuse her of disrespecting the designers and the models because the show hadn’t started yet. She looked very focused and attentive. The sky-blue lacey dress she wore was inlaid with glittering crushed diamonds. The two diamond-sprinkled shoulder straps loosely hung from her shoulders. It emanated a laid-back but elegant look.</p>
<p>She was so engrossed in whatever she was reading, neither the people walking around, nor the flashing cameras around her could disturb her from her concentration. After a while, she put a finger on her chin, and scrunched her eyebrows, as though she had encountered a very serious problem in whatever she was reading.</p>
<p>When the show finally started, Shen Yichong held her hand. She put the book back in her limited-edition bag and directed her attention towards the front. When the show ended, James made his way towards her. “Ms. Yu?” he enquired.</p>
<p>Many people had begun to leave now. Some stayed behind for a while to snap some pictures with the designers or the models. Some reporters were busy interviewing the designers. But Yu Yaoyao was silent. She was back to her reading when the show ended. Now she looked up, having been interrupted by James.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t know English, and James didn’t know Chinese, but it was just as well that translators were present. He had come prepared. Besides, Shen Yichong’s English was pretty decent.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao politely stood up from her seat, along with her husband. They greeted each other warmly. James commended her on her taste of fashion. She thanked him. “Ms. Yu, I saw your eyes twinkling when the show began,” said James jokingly, “Was it because the show was beautiful, or you couldn’t forget about whatever exciting thing you were reading?”</p>
<p>The joke was lost on her. Yu Yaoyao looked embarrassed and hid the book behind her. “I am so sorry,” she said, “The clothes were so beautiful. I have only seen such beautiful dresses on TV.”</p>
<p>This was Yu Yaoyao’s first live show. She had never seen clothes as beautiful as these in reality before. When she was a snake in a zoo, people rarely dressed up for a visit.</p>
<p>James laughed out loud. This was such a down-to-earth and pleasant reply. He had watched her when the show was going on. Her face would light up at certain outfits. She looked full of longing when that happened. She was indeed a straightforward and interesting person.</p>
<p>“This book,” said Yu Yaoyao, showing it to him, “is about professional acting. I was reading it to prepare for my role on an upcoming TV show. I am so sorry if you found it disrupting, I was trying to finish reading it because I have promised my husband that I would at least finish half of it before I begin shooting. But as soon as the show began, I couldn’t focus on these drab words. The beautiful outfits pulled me out of these pages. The pink and golden tones are especially exquisite. They made me feel very nostalgic.” Her eyes were glittering.</p>
<p>James had heard praises from many people over the years. Each year ADORE got in touch with many celebrities in search for a new spokesperson. Each year, he would be showered in praises, many of them hollow. But the way Yu Yaoyao praised with such naivety and honesty with eyes glittering made him feel honored. He chuckled.</p>
<p>The translator relayed his words to her. “Ms. Yu,” said the translator, “Mr. James said you might as well have been his confidant in the way you praised the dresses. If it wasn’t for the fact that these designs have been brought to China for the first time, he would have assumed you took a peek at his desk.”</p>
<p>The translator waited for Mr. James to finish talking before continuing, “He, as a chief designer, would like to formally invite you to be ADORE’s first three-year spokesperson from the Asian region. He appreciates your imagination and has watched your reality show. He admires your bravery, especially regarding the insects, which even he feels queasy to touch. He also is very impressed by your wisdom and decision-making. He thinks you are very knowledgeable, even in your young age. If you would be so interested, he would like to contact your manager with the details. He also invites you to come with him to the backstage so you can admire the designs and outfits to your heart’s content. He also offers you three sets of any outfit you choose as a gift from his part. If possible, he would like to design a dress especially for you.”</p>
<p>As the translator finished relaying Mr. James’ words, the reporters who were getting them on camera looked stunned. Even Shen Yichong, who was always calm, was surprised.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie who was watching everything on-screen at home couldn’t take it anymore. She rushed to the next bedroom with her phone in hand.</p>
<p>“Mummy, have you seen?” she asked, “Yu Yaoyao is ignoring us! Now that she is rich, we mean nothing to her. You should remind her that no matter how rich she becomes, it’s you and dad who took such pains to raise her! She shouldn’t be allowed to forget her roots!”</p>
