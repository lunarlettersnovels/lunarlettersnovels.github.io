            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 57 – Between Two Extremes</strong></p>
<p>“Sister Yu is good at acting, there’s no need to be modest,” a sweet voice suddenly drifted out, as the door opened.</p>
<p>It was Meng Xinran who came out with a smile.</p>
<p>“My sister and I have acted in the same project before. And sister Yu’s acting skills are even better than mine. She deserves the first place.” Meng Xinran broke into her trademark pure and gentle smile.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she had a sign on her chest labelled ‘18’. In other words, she had chosen the 18th ranking for this program, which is considerably a safe choice, neither too humbling or supercilious; the middle between two extremes.</p>
<p>Even when she gets eliminated first, the audience would still say that she was hardworking and innocent, her strength merely just average, but she still finally fought hard.</p>
<p><em>Devious! </em>Ni Yi looked at her guiltless smiling face and suddenly felt goose bumps rise on his neck.</p>
<p>This Meng Xinran is clearly a poisonous, small white lotus! Moreover, she is adamant to stomp on Yu Yaoyao!</p>
<p>If Yu Yaoyao chooses the first position for this competition, how can she still have face when she immediately loses on the first round?!</p>
<p>Ni Yi took a deep breath and said, “Sister…let’s choose the last one.”</p>
<p>This was an acceptable option for someone who has only returned to the entertainment circle after five years of hiatus.</p>
<p>But as he said this, the last contestant arrived, and came forward to the deputy director to choose her position. She even came alone, unaccompanied by her manager, which spoke quite a few meanings.</p>
<p>“Director, photographers, everyone! I-I am Zhao Xiaomeng!” She nervously stuttered during the last half of her sentence as her face turned deep red in embarrassment.</p>
<p>And after she had learned the situation concerning the available rankings, her face turned pale as a sheet. “Th-then, can I choose first? Director, I-I-I only acted in supporting roles, I didn’t even formally study in an acting school. The first position, I-I c-certainly can’t…”</p>
<p>“Many actors are better than me…” as she said this concluding remark, she burst into tears.</p>
<p>Ni Yi sighed. This truly was a very cruel and unfavorable situation for newcomers. There’s no doubt that she’ll be put on the hot seat. After all, most of the people who came to participate in this competition already have their own steady following of fans.</p>
<p>So, if an amateur actress, without a large fanbase, took the first place, it would be expected that she would be lambasted to death by the fans of the other contestants, who think their idol deserves the top spot</p>
<p>But he cannot relent and be soft-hearted now! If he gives her his sympathy, then they will be finished!</p>
<p>Therefore, despite his inner turmoil, Ni Yi, as kindly as he could, suggested, “Miss Zhao, you could discuss with the Director and have the photographers take a picture of you being the last to arrive to prove that you were truly forced to choose the first place.”</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng bit his lip and could only nod helplessly, “Then…I’ll go to the first room now.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao suddenly spoke, “What are you crying about? Do you prefer to choose the last place and share a room with three other contestants that you don’t know? Then you can go ahead.”</p>
<p>She turned to Ni Yi and resolutely said, “I’ll choose the first position, and this way, I get to live in a big room. ”</p>
<p>Ni Yi, the anxious manager was struck with horror!</p>
<p>“Sister, please don’t kid with me! We have already decided on the last place. We all agreed with the Director. Yes, that’s right!”</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng eyes, which lit up, instantly dimmed again.</p>
<p>Yet Yu Yaoyao did not hesitate to take the sign from Ni Yi which said ‘88’ and placed it on Xiaomeng’s hand, “Here, take it.”</p>
<p>“Sister…”</p>
<p>“I don’t like living with others,” she merely reasoned.</p>
<p><em>I’ve been roommates with other snakes for 100 years already, I’m tired of it!</em></p>
<p>I’ve lived with other snakes for 100 years and I’m bored!</p>
<p>“Besides, I also think I am number one.”</p>
<p>Before Ni Yi could even stop her, Yu Yaoyao had already taken the first sign from Zhao Xiaomeng, whose eyes were already red.</p>
<p>“Where is the first room?” she asked the deputy director.</p>
<p>Ni Yi really wanted to kneel down! He begged, “Sister, sister, please–if you fall to the bottom, people will definitely roast you! Even with all the money I have…I still don’t think the first place is possible. Sister, you are different from the fresh talents…”</p>
<p>He became extremely anxious just thinking about their imminent downfall!</p>
<p>Amateur actors with raw talent can be especially young and fearless. Although Yu Yaoyao started in the acting world five years ago, she had a bad acting record for being scolded after foolishly reading the numbers in the script!</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao patted him firmly on the shoulder, “Don’t panic. You can’t also accompany me inside, right? All right, see you after work! Just cheer for this B List actress.”</p>
<p>In the end, unable to stop her, Ni Yi could only surrender. And Zhao Xiaomeng beside him, was also at a loss on what to do at the unfurling scene.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao has already walked with graceful steps towards the room where the sign ‘number one’ was hanged on the door.</p>
<p>Ni Yi watched her enter, leaning limply against the wall and covering his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng bowed to him. “Thank you, thank you…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “…”</p>
