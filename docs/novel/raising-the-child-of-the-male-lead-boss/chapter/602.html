            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 150 – My Husband is a Bully (3)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao lowered her head and followed his slender finger referring to the part of the script that he wanted her to practice.</p>
<p>“That much?” she instantly complained.</p>
<p>“Why? Do you want more?” Shen Yichong stood up and glanced down at her testingly. “You are playing a supporting role and you can’t even bear to finish the script amounting to half an hour’s time.”</p>
<p>Her lips drawled to a sly smile, “Then you can wash the dishes slowly for half an hour.”</p>
<p>“Wash the dishes for half an hour?” Shen Yichong mouth twitched at the outrageous demand.</p>
<p>But there were only three bowls and cups to wash. Furthermore, they had a dishwasher at home. He thought of it for a while and nodded reluctantly. Since Yu Yaoyao somehow never disappoints the director or the photographer of a photoshoot, he decided to agree with her.</p>
<p>Just when everyone thought that she would start reading the script seriously, in the end Yu Yaoyao couldn’t stay still and focus on the task as she was told. A few moments later, she closed the papers firmly and looked towards where her husband was.</p>
<p>As soon as her little head glanced back, she snuck a peek on Shen Yichong with his back face to her in the kitchen. Realizing that he was standing in front of the sink, occupied with washing the dishes and his attention fully occupied, her full, red lips stretched to smile like a cheshire cat.</p>
<p>Initially, she was dutifully reciting her script with her waist flat down on the couch. A few moments later, she speedily tiptoed towards a small cabinet, where one of the cameramen was standing. She smiled at him, then bent over to open the tiny door.</p>
<p>From the inside, she took out a bag of grape-flavored jelly, escaped back to the couch and laid out the script as if nothing had happened. She read a line and opened the bag. Thereafter, she read two lines and stuffed her mouth with the jelly. Then after reading three more sentences, she had already emptied the small bag of gummies.</p>
<p>Satisfied, she wiped the corners of her mouth with the back of her hand and squeezed the empty bag in her hand. To eliminate the evidence, she stood up and threw it into the trash can beside the sofa.</p>
<p>But suddenly, footsteps could be heard from behind her back and a displeased low voice sounded over her head.</p>
<p>“Was there an action included in the script?” Yu Yaoyao suddenly froze, still standing. But since she was frightened by the unexpected appearance of her husband, she lost her balance and clumsily tumbled towards the coffee table.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his sinewy arms grabbed her from behind, preventing her from embarrassing herself in front of the camera. She turned her head to see who had been her savior and discovered that it was her husband who had saved her from an untimely accident… now fixing her with a very solemn look.</p>
<p>“I, I…” She swallowed the lump in her throat and carefully studied her husband’s face.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, with his arms around his wife, lifted his other hand that was holding the crumpled bag he just picked from the floor.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s a piece of garbage I found on the ground! What are the odds!” she immediately tried to reason.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the cameramen who were filming the couple for content suddenly laughed..</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao became flustered and tried to explain more. “I was about to throw it away. Husband! We should become healthier and practice CLAYGO!”</p>
<p>CLAYGO was an abbreviation which means to clean as you go.</p>
<p>To which Shen Yichong only replied, with a smirk on his face, “Well, why do I smell gummies from your mouth?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao suddenly covered her mouth in horror, making some of the production staff burst out in laughter and giggles till their shoulders almost shook. Even Director Zhao Yu was beaming at the seams with the warm scene before him.</p>
<p>But then, Shen Yichong’s steely gaze landed on them, putting a stop to the cameramen and the director’s giddy mood. Only after they had settled down did he withdraw his gaze and look back at Yu Yaoyao with a gloomy expression.</p>
<p>“Have you finished memorizing the script?” He held out his hand holding the bag. Yu Yaoyao bit her lower lip and took the crumpled trash from her husband’s hand.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face turned darker. “Script!” He said, looking at Yu Yaoyao while pointing at the papers laid out on the table, forgotten.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Yu Yaoyao quickly turned back to the sofa and hastily took the papers into her hands.</p>
<p>“Again,” Shen Yichong stared at her with an impassive expression. “Start from the very beginning of your script.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao opened her mouth to protest, but she soon gave up, and quickly turned her eyes to the script she was holding.</p>
<p>“The first act was… I was lying on my bed eating the grapes my maid had fetched for me. And drinking goat’s milk and… I then went to eat some snacks for the sake of–” She enumerated in order.</p>
<p>The cameras carried by some of the staff began to shake, several of them trying to fight the laughter that was bubbling inside them. They tried to maintain a steady hold on their electronics while managing not to succumb to giggles at the unfurling scenario.</p>
<p>Despite not finishing with her statement, Shen Yichong had already taken the script from her hands, rolled it and then knocked it on her head. “It says melon, not grapes!”</p>
<p><em>Pffft!</em> This time, Zhao Yu was unable to hold back his laughter any longer!</p>
