            <p><strong>Chapter 385</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>For the final filming of ‘My Wife and I’, Zhao Yu wanted the theme to be warm and memorable. He knew the actual life situations of the family were different, but by combining the personalities of husband and wife, he knew they could find a solution.</p>
<p>But he had never expected Shen Yichong to create such a difficult problem to solve by asking them to finish the shooting in a French fine-dining restaurant.</p>
<p>The nice, warm scene had now become the perfect way for him to show off his wealth. One glance at the menu was enough to confirmed this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duck Liver Lollipop: 500 Yuan</li>
<li>Creamy Blue Lobster: 1500 Yuan</li>
<li>Black Truffle Steak: 2000 Yuan</li>
</ul>
<p>Zhao Yu’s eyes widened that further along he read:</p>
<ul>
<li>86-year-old Red Wine: 12 000 Yuan</li>
</ul>
<p>Old Zheng, the cameraman, nearly choked when he saw the prices. After he had taken a shot of the menu and the prices, he moved onto Yu Yaoyao’s shooting.</p>
<p>Director Zhao took a big breath.</p>
<p>The program group had been able to come quickly since the restaurant was quite close to their office. By the time they had arrived, Shen Yichong had already given the restaurant owner a heads up for their arrival, and they were cleared to shoot as soon as they got there. The only condition was that they didn’t disturb the other guests.</p>
<p>A meal at the prices on the menu may not be a big deal for the rich, but it made the recording team sweat a little.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t long until Zhao Yu heard Yu Yaoyao start complaining in a sad, frustrated voice.</p>
<p>“Darling, why is the steak so expensive?” Yu Yaoyao knew more about the world now. She was no longer that naïve person who had no idea how to manage her wealth. “The one Little Sisi brought me only cost 100 Yuan!”</p>
<p>She had barely finished speaking before Little Bun, who was sitting beside her, started calculating the difference between the two prices on his fingers.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled. “They’re not the same. It tastes good, you should try it.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had also saved a lot of money recently. Her shopping sprees had slowed down, and she now earned more than she spent. She had saved enough for her to be able to comfortably spend for several lifetimes.</p>
<p>This was partly since she always stayed home when she didn’t have to film. As a cold-blooded animal, she didn’t like to go outside when it was too hot or cold. She preferred to stay indoors under the aircon.</p>
<p>Unless Little Sisi took her out.</p>
<p>Then again, she also liked to hoard assets and money. This could have been due to her hibernation habits from the past years. She liked to hide any surplus and save it for later.</p>
<p>So of course, the sight of the five-figure meal horrified her.</p>
<p>But in the end, she ordered the steak. After taking one bite she discovered that the food was delicious. “Oh my God! This beef is amazing!”</p>
<p>She couldn’t stop eating. Even once she had finished all her food, she couldn’t stop thinking about it. She licked her lower lip and narrowed her eyes as she recalled the taste. “It had a strong milky flavor, and it was salty and fragrant. It tasted like fresh, delicious mushrooms, only it wasn’t. This really levelled up my expectations for the taste of beef. Gosh! Darling! I think the cells in my mouth are dancing!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong blinked, staring at her in silence.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was utterly speechless.</p>
<p>Little Bun followed her movements as he ate his own food. He made a serious face as he chewed and squinted his eyes a little.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu couldn’t believe what was happening. It felt like they were doing a free advertisement for the restaurant!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t seem to notice his concern and remind quite cheerful in front of the camera. “Darling, these caviar noodles are delicious.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you like them,” Shen Yichong said, before he turned to the waiter and spoke to him in French.</p>
<p>Almost no one in the room understood.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu could only smile bitterly. He didn’t know what Shen Yichong had said, and he didn’t dare ask.</p>
<p>They didn’t have to wait long before the male waiter returned, carrying two round, metal boxes, each one baring a different lable.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at Yu Yaoyao with a smile. “This is white sturgeon caviar that’s more than 60 years old. And that one is caviar mixed with 22k gold,” he said as he gestured to the boxes in turn. “Try them. If you like it, we will buy some and take it home.”</p>
<p>The corner of Zhao Yu’s eyes twitched. While his paycheck as a director wasn’t bad, he knew he would never be able to afford a luxury like that. But it wasn’t the first time he was hearing about food like this.</p>
<p>Top-class caviar could cost hundreds of thousands per spoon.</p>
<p>The direction of this show was really… Nouveau riche.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao refused. “Darling, I don’t want to take any home. I’ll just taste it. How many baby fish were killed to make this single box?”</p>
<p>When she peered into the box, she saw the densely packed black, translucent caviar. It looked like thousands of tiny, shiny pearls clustered together. The moment she laid eyes on them; her body started to shake violently.</p>
<p>There had only been a few in the pasta before, so she hadn’t had such a visceral reaction. After all, in nature the food chain was harsh. Those at the top didn’t sympathize with those at the bottom. But looking into the densely packed boxes at all those eggs, the thought of just how many fish had been killed just so they could eat the roe made her skin crawl.</p>
<p>As a woman, the thought was just too much. It was savage.</p>
<p>Chills raced up and down her body as she looked at them. “Darling, forget it. Send then back,” Yu Yaoyao said as she covered her eyes.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was a little surprised.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had always been a foodie. She didn’t really care about her figure, and she was forever violating the rules on set… Like sneaking food in and doing other unexpected things. He thought she would enjoy something like this. But apparently, he was wrong.</p>
<p>When he asked her to rest at home, she refused and insisted on working. He always let her enjoy her food, but she held back because she felt her behavior was pitiful.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed his thin lips tightly together. His dark, gloomy eyes stared out at Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>She had already pushed the caviar away. She was looking down at the big lobster in front of her now, clearly trying to decide whether she should start with the left or the right leg.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her head and glanced at him suspiciously. “What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, just…” Shen Yichong reached out and touched her pinkish face, “You’re so cute.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blushed, “Darling…”</p>
<p>But before she could finish speaking, Little Bun came close to her right cheek and said, “Mummy, I also think you are cute.”</p>
<p>The affectionate bubble between the couple burst at that moment.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pinched between his eyebrows when he saw his son was about to wriggle his little butt onto the dining table.</p>
<p>“I won’t eat this caviar either, Mommy. I’ll leave it all for Dad,” as Shen Rui said this, he pushed the caviar in his small dish towards Shen Yichong, apparently finished flattering Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>The expression on his face looked as though he were saying, “I am a good baby. My father is the bad guy”.</p>
<p>It made Shen Yichong laugh.</p>
