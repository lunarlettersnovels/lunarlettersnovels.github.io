            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 133 – Don’t Make Your Husband Jealous (2)</strong></p>
<p>Not only was Yu Yaoyao wearing such short trousers, she even pulled up her revealing her waist. It was incredibly glaring to the eyes!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao said, “But I’m so pretty here…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows knotted. “What’s the connection between exposing your legs to the internet and your recent pudding endorsement? It’s too much of a conflict, so delete it at once.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi bowed his head in confusion. <em>A conflict? If sister is too sexy, it will affect her advertisements to be filmed at home…?</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the culprit was on the verge of breaking down. “I can’t eat pudding if I wear shorts?! Aren’t you too much!?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao lamented piteously. She looked anxiously towards the bedside table in the room, close to her side, where a single pudding was left. It was all the little bun had saved for her so she could feel better.</p>
<p><em>Ah. This shortage of supplies is worrying!</em></p>
<p></p><center><sup>Chapter By WordExcerpt</sup></center><p></p>
<div data-fuse="22037242891"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>If she ate this last pudding, there would be no more!</p>
<p>And since she was currently ill, her management was stricter. She can’t even sneak out of the hotel to play.</p>
<p>“Ah, fine. I’ll delete it.” Yu Yaoyao felt forced to submit to her voracious appetite. She removed the post and showed her phone to Shen Yichong obediently. The latter’s cold eyes suddenly melted after seeing the screen.</p>
<p>He nodded with satisfaction, “You will have more projects in the future. You should pay more attention to your public image.” Then he added, “I watched the episodes for <em>In the Limelight, </em>your performance is not that bad.”</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong saw her sad, pouting face, he unexpected blurted out praises for her—and he had never complimented Yu Yaoyao before.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes suddenly flashed. When Shen Yichong had given her compliments, she realized that he felt good when she confessed her issues to him. And that, in turn, meant the ice block actually liked her.</p>
<p>Standing on the stop, she gave a small, delighted smile.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shen Yichong was looking at Ni Yi and wasn’t able to spot the quick joy on her face.</p>
<p>“I’ll go with you to the filming for the pudding advertisement tomorrow,” He said</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>
<p></p><center><sup>Chapter By WordExcerpt</sup></center><p></p>
<div data-fuse="22037344116"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Seeing his wife’s foolish expression, Shen Yichong suddenly felt gratified, “The director is a friend of mine for many years.”</p>
<p>As he expected, in the next second, he saw Yu Yaoyao’s face instantly change. As if the gray clouds had suddenly vanished, her little, pink face was shining brightly like the sun. Even her tender cheeks swelled like a squirrel munching on grain. Some bangs on her forehead also stood on ends, like her son’s hair, as if she had just woken up from slumber.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong found himself stretching out a hand to press her messy hair down. As his warm palm touched her head, and he saw her big, watery eyes, his heart felt instantly moved.</p>
<p>“If you see something you like tomorrow, you can take it back home.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Yu Yaoyao jumped in excitement and kissed him directly on the chin. “Husband, you are indeed the most powerful, and I love you so much!”</p>
<p>Contrary to the times she had kissed him where he would push her away, this time, Shen Yichong merely turned around and waved his hand dismissively in the air.</p>
<p>As he turned back and saw her cheerful face, his lips couldn’t help but tug at the corners.</p>
<p>“I’m going to work in the living room… You should sleep a bit more. Advertising isn’t a competition, and it would mostly take five minutes—maybe until the director is satisfied. Close your eyes and rest your mind for today,” he reminded her just before he went out.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao made a strangled sound at his reminder—one of his rare pamperings, and ran towards him, softly slamming into his back. Her delicate, jade-like arm encircled around his muscular waist and reached for his abdomen under his suit.  As the latter turned around, she followed him like a persistent koala clutching to a tree.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s smile became warped… as he felt the soft mass behind him, he became frozen in a few moments. Then, he took her hands and said,</p>
<p>“Go rest.”</p>
<p>“Okay, husband. I’ll wait for you to come back…”</p>
<p>Her delicate voice sounded just below him like a fragrant wind blowing his ear numb.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes suddenly became dark, but Yaoyao was only ignorant as she pulled away from him.</p>
<p>Does she think he’s some kind of monk? And after she teases him, it’s suddenly over?</p>
<p>“Wait.” His rough voice called her back. He fixed the charming woman behind him with a deep gaze.</p>
<p>At this point, the unfortunate bystander, Ni Yi, felt he had already become one with the wall and pretended to be deaf to everything.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao was happily opening the wardrobe to pick out her sleeping attire. This time, she must not be too lax, she must let this man fall for her charms once and for all!</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Late into the night, Shen Yichong came back while Yu Yaoyao was lying on the bed in her black silk pajamas. She had just finally coaxed the little bun, laying beside her, to sleep.</p>
<p>“Husband…” She whispered, calling him as softly as she could.</p>
<p>“The baby is asleep now. You can wait—ah, be careful, don’t move the bed so much…”</p>
<p>However, as soon as she had finished speaking, the sky whirled before her eyes! Shen Yichong flipped her body around like a pancake and held her down.</p>
<p><em>Oh, my! This pose!</em></p>
<p>Then, suddenly ‘<em>Pa! </em>A loud slap rang in the vicinity. And Yu Yaoyao immediately let out a soft cry!</p>
<p>Did Shen Yichong just… slap her bottom!?</p>
<p>“I told you to delete it, but you put me on the hot search!”</p>
<p>After finishing his work, he wanted to take a long rest and see how his company artists were faring, when he saw a lot of accounts tagging him online.</p>
<p><strong>[Yu Yaoyao V: I’m sorry, my husband told me to delete my recent post! I have her attached a new post. My husband helped me measure my legs! Yes!]</strong></p>
<p>It was a side view picture stealthily taken on a mirror as she leaned on her husband!</p>
<p>The netizens became stirred again. And now Shen Yichong had many titles… jealous boss Shen and an overbearing husband who only wants his wife to take a picture with him!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao innocently looked at him, “Husband… didn’t you tell me I should be careful of my public image and make sure it has no conflict with my contracts? Well, if I take a picture of you with me, then I’m endorsing it as a loving family eating pudding together!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s hand suddenly halted mid-air.</p>
<p><em>Family…</em></p>
