            <p><strong>Chapter 270 – Reunited</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>The crowd cheered as Yu Yaoyao crashed on Shen Yichong’s back and tightly wrapped her arms around his waist. She buried her face in his coat. “Hubby, I found you…,” she said, still panting from running so much. The noise from the cheering crowd was overwhelming, but he heard Yu Yaoyao so clearly.</p>
<p>He grinned and turned around to pull her in his embrace. His cold and solemn demeanor had melted away by Yu Yaoyao’s soft calls. “Thank you for finding me,” he whispered. His heart was beating thunderously. He was so glad to see her. Yu Yaoyao buried her face in his chest, finding comfort. He reached out and turned her face up to him. He leaned down and kissed her deeply.</p>
<p>The fans went crazy. Even Director Zhao showed a smile on seeing the couple together. He had allocated forty-eight hours for her to find him; she had done it in eight! But these eight hours had been much more difficult for the couple as well as the fans who had witnessed the times when the two were within reach and had passed each other, unknowingly. The fans, after the anxiety and frustration, had finally seen them together. They couldn’t help getting teary-eyed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao were still locked in the kiss when they heard a childish, impatient voice. “Daddy!” Shen Rui said happily, “mommy!” They broke apart as they saw Little Bun bounding towards them, holding the hand of a staff. He had been so impatient that he hadn’t waited for his mom and decided to come here with the staff. He had gotten worried when he heard the loud crowd from afar. But he had seen his parents in an embrace as he reached the bridge and gotten angry, thinking that his father was bullying his mom.</p>
<p>Shen Rui puffed up his cheeks, thanked the staff, and rushed to his parents by himself. He was flushed from the walk. His little legs trotted hurriedly through the remaining distance in his light-yellow onesie. He tried to run a little as he reached the foot of the bridge. Everyone found him so cute and pouty, they were urging him to be careful as he ran to his parents. “I will be careful,” he said to them, “I won’t fall. I have to get there fast. Dad is bullying mommy again.” He ran faster.</p>
<p>The crowd couldn’t help but feel affection for this little kid who thought he could do anything to protect his mother. It was such a sweet and heartfelt gesture. Director Zhao chuckled. “Mr. Shen,” he teased, “Why not wait a little more before you try to ‘bully’ her again?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled at Director Zhao. He then looked at Shen Rui, who had rushed over to them, finally. Leaning down, he picked Little Bun up and placed a kiss on his forehead. He wrapped his other arm around Yu Yaoyao and pulled her close.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at people around them shyly, her lips still a little red and sore from the kiss. But her heart was full and happy. She had felt such comfort and safety in Shen Yichong’s embrace. Her smile grew wider thinking about the kiss.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to Yu Yaoyao and family,” Director Zhao declared. “You took a total of seven hours and forty-three minutes to find your husband. This is the fastest that anybody has managed until now. Next up, the task is …,” the Director trailed off, maintaining an air of suspense. He then smiled. “The next task is for you to enjoy your time here as a family of three,” he said, “We will meet again in about forty hours. Goodbye!”</p>
<p>“Aw, make a second baby tonight,” shouted one of the fans from the crowd. “Don’t work tonight, Mr. Shen. You have a baby to make,” said another. The crowd erupted in laughter and requests for a new member in the family.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen laughed awkwardly. “Alright,” he said, looking down at Yu Yaoyao, who was blushing furiously. She looked so embarrassed that Shen Yichong chuckled. The moment was interrupted by a rumbling noise, adding to Yu Yaoyao’s embarrassment.</p>
<p>“I am hungry,” said Yu Yaoyao, pitiably raising her head to look at Shen Yichong. Shen Rui looked down at his mom sadly. The levels had taken a toll on both mother and son and left them hungry and exhausted.</p>
<p>“Let’s go eat some seafood, alright?” Shen Yichong said to Yu Yaoyao warmly and patted Shen Rui on the back. “We will eat as much as we want without any worry. Let’s go!” he said to Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Shen Rui looked at them both and pouted. He thought his parents were too focused on each other. “I am hungry too!” he snapped, “I want seafood as well!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong laughed. “Alright, Seafood, it is!” he said, ushering them both along.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That day, all social media platforms had pictures of the Yaoyao couple. Many fans noticed that their favorite celebrity had liked their posts when they had ardently defended Shen Yichong:</p>
<p><strong>【Y has liked all of my posts that defend Mr. Shen from the allegations before! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Oh! I’ve also been liked by her! I’ve been noticed! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【I’ve locked this ship and eaten the key! 】</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was so unpredictable that she always provided more surprises for fans to love her. No matter how bored you got, she would always do something entirely unexpected and humorous.</p>
<p>At this moment, George, the CEO of the Chinese branch of a casual luxury brand, named Adore, was enraptured by the happenings in Weibo. He knocked on the door of James, Chief Designer of the company, who was in the same hotel.</p>
<p>“My dear James, I have found a treasure,” he said, “You might want to take a look.”</p>
<p>George showed the social media posts about Yu Yaoyao to James. “You are releasing a Spring and Autumn style next year, are you not?” he said, “I think she would be very suitable for your project. She has an Eastern type of beauty and she is very intelligent and gentle. I think it is time we go to China to find her and propose a deal.”</p>
