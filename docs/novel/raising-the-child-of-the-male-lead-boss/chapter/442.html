<p><strong>Chapter 321 – A Coy Little Bun (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>After 11pm that night, Ni Yi’s phone started blowing up with various calls from several different endorsers and interviewers.</p>
<p>In the past, due to her tears and melancholy, Yu Yaoyao was painted as an emotional woman with a tragic past. But now, she had managed to abruptly transform herself from one who had succumbed to a melodramatic, dog-blooded drama into a smart, successful, and beautiful woman. She was a proper female artist with a high IQ and EQ, as well as a cute, iconic smile of her own! Seemingly all at once, her current upward flow, coupled with her having solved the issue of her blood-sucking relatives, had opened various people’s eyes towards her endless potential.</p>
<p>“The first female lead of the movie? If I’m not wrong, it’s the one where the lovely white lotus tries to overthrow the hedonistic yet charming President Ba, right? Okay, I’ve noted it down.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Zhao, a script tailored for my sister? The setting of the female president is, um…” Ni Yi said.</p>
<p>“Well, Director Zheng, the role of an influential sister in the fashion industry? The script calls for a strong female character. Got it.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Brother Zhou, the heroine is an assassin? It’s only towards the end we realize she sacrificed herself to save the world?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi noted down all the offers he received as he answered the calls.</p>
<p>Some scripts made him scream ‘Kyaaaa!’ in his heart, while others were so outlandish, he couldn’t keep his disgust down or digest it. The night showed no sign of coming to an end.</p>
<p>What’s more, even Director Zhao Yu called, “I want to book Yu Yaoyao for the second season of ‘My Wife and I’ before it’s too late! Any level of remuneration you demand is okay, Xiao Yi!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi wiped his sweat. Zhao Yu even knew Yu Yaoyao’s nickname for him!</p>
<p>“Also, since the first season of ‘Wife and I’ is drawing to a close, I’m planning to customize a special, tailor-made segment specifically for Xiao Yu and Shen called, ‘Welcome to My Home.’ You know, sort of similar to that other program being run on the other channel. Of course, we’ll have to modify it quite a bit and make something new out of it…” Director Zhao Yu said.</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s lips curled as he listened, to even call it a tailor-made segment was laughable! Director Zhao Yu was shameless. Clearly, he didn’t have any dignity. “Though President Shen may participate with Yu Yaoyao, do you really think he’s going to allow his young son to be part of the crew? You’re talking about the impossible, there’s no way you’ll be able to persuade him,” Ni Yi said.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu replied immediately, striking at the key points, “The children are going to be on their winter vacation soon. There’s no need for him to go to the kindergarten to study during this period. As soon as today’s episode was broadcast, President Shen’s son’s popularity skyrocketed and almost surpassed his own among the voices of the netizens, despite having his face censored with a puppy sticker. As for handling that matter… I hope President Shen will accept the new terms.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was taken aback and quickly replied, “Director Zhao. I’m not Boss Shen’s agent, I’m only responsible for my sisters’ affairs.”</p>
<p>“Your family’s big boss always complies with Xiao Yu’s wishes, doesn’t he? Who in the industry doesn’t know who dons the pants between those two? All she’s gotta do is coax him a bit, and President Shen will turn into soft mush.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was speechless. Director Zhao dared to say these words, it had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>Besides Director Zhao, there were also many calls from various TV stations and web programs inviting Yu Yaoyao to take part in variety shows. The traffic she had received as a small-time reality show actress had elevated her to success and fame. Many major platforms were seduced by the promise of big gains from the show’s vibrant explosion.</p>
<p>The calls continued to come in one by one, showing no signs of stopping. Everyone wanted their piece: Cooking shows, talk shows, wilderness survival shows, competitive game shows… There was even a new-generation talent show, which requested that Yu Yaoyao sign a contract as a judge.</p>
<p>It was only in the early hours of the following morning that Ni Yi’s cellphone was finally able to catch a break. By that time, the company’s mailbox was full of different plans, scripts, publicity campaigns and more. His notebook was full of proposals that were made to him through a night of non-stop phone calls.</p>
<p>Ni Yi finally felt what the life of a gold level agent of an experienced artist was like.</p>
<p>Despite battling the entire night, he went back to the company the very next day and started discussing the pros and cons of various scripts and variety shows with the Marketing and Strategy Departments before choosing a select few for Yu Yaoyao to take a look at.</p>
<p>“Actually, ‘Welcome to My Home’ looks pretty good,” Bi Lei, the head of the Marketing Department said as he glanced down at the proposal. “The success of both ‘Stage’ and ‘Wife and I’ proves Zhao Yu’s ability to direct acclaimed variety shows. His style is very popular and aligns with the general consensus of the audience. The post-production edits are very tasteful, and of great quality, capable of bringing the viewers to both laughter and tears. Secondly, the success of the later half of ‘Wife and I’ not only brought Yu Yaoyao great popularity, but also brought with it a great number of invitations from both television and the big screen. In addition…”</p>
<p>Bi Lei paused in the middle of speaking, a subtle expression taking shape on his face, “Because of President Shen’s involvement in the show, Guangxin’s share price has also performed very well recently. Some of the TV dramas that the company has invested in are yet to be broadcasted, but as an extension, the public has expressed high expectation and anticipation for them by default.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi raised a hand to interrupt, “Director Zhao hopes for President Shen’s son to come as a regular guest on this new show. There’s a high chance that President Shen will disagree. Moreover, this show’s concept is somewhat similar to ‘My Wife and I’ and the themes mostly overlap. This may not bring more breakthroughs for my sister later on.” He often followed Yu Yaoyao around, both in and out of filming, and had a decent understanding of President Shen’s attitude.</p>
<p>Bi Lei frowned, “Then choose a script first. Variety shows can be used as a supplement to the script. If the script chosen is of a serious and literary kind, I suggest that you continue to maintain daily variety shows and display a down-to-earth attitude to the general public. If the script chosen is comedic and calls for a cheerful and outgoing character, balance it out with talk shows and serious in-depth interviews so they complement each other.”</p>
<p>The Marketing and Strategic Department finally reached a consensus on the issue. Ni Yi found this conclusion to be reasonable.</p>
<p>However, when he took these carefully selected plans and went to report to Yu Yaoyao at the hotel room, he encountered a problem. He was only halfway through elaborating the various proposals when the little bun, Shen Rui, who had finished school early that day, arrived at home.</p>
<p>The little bun pinched a corner of Ni Yi’s clothes with both of his tiny, chubby hands and looked at him pitifully through his eyelashes, “Uncle Ni, among these, are there any jobs where I can work with Mommy? Other kids get to go out and spend time with their Mommy and Daddy for winter vacation. But I… I don’t really like to play outside, and Mommy works, can I also go there with her?”</p>
<p>When Ni Yi heard this, his heart hurt. His relatives’ child always got to spend all his vacations and weekends with his parents, playing everywhere. This little bun was barely 5 years old, an age at which children still relied on their mothers the most. But… Sister Yu was always busy with work. Upon entering the cast, one had to remain on set for at least a month.</p>
<p>“Um… Let me think about it…” Ni Yi said mysteriously.</p>
<p>The little bun’s eyes lit up when he heard this. When he saw that Ni Yi didn’t react to his expression, he stretched out a little white index finger and pointed at the elaborately decorated ‘Welcome To My Home’ proposal with Zhao Yu’s set design on the cover, “This playhouse looks big!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was struck speechless.</p>
