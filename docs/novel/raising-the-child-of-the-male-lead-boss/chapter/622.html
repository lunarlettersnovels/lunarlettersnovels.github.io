            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 130 – My Husband is my Iron Fortress</strong></p>
<p>The netizens who were thriving at the constant drama, all felt a turmoil of emotions at the unfurling scenarios. Upon seeing this microblog they couldn’t help but utter exclamations for Shen Yichong.</p>
<p><strong>[Big boss Shen, this person just robbed your place as husband.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Jealous, jealous, jealous…]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I’ll be here till the day boss Shen collapses!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Although clearly this is a very serious matter, I still can’t help but laugh… @ Shen Yichong, are you going to find this big brother as well?]</strong></p>
<p>It was as if they were woken from their stupor after their jests died down. This Meng Xinran, whom they all believed to be a small white flower of the entertainment industry, has become unrecognizable in their eyes!</p>
<p>Such a sweet-looking girl is insidiously black-bellied and hypocritical and would even go to crude attempts to blackmail someone. <em>What an extremely sinister heart</em>, they all thought.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s cruel deeds exposed to the internet became lambasted by the community.</p>
<p><strong>[You disgusting villain, get out of the entertainment circle!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[There’s no escape from all the evidence presented. I wish you reborn with even one good thing inside your brain in the next life!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[What kind of idol have raised such a group of malicious fans! I can feel second-hand embarrassment for criticizing ‘my wife’!]</strong></p>
<p>Resilient, Meng Xinran’s fans still quarreled with this group. Yet, as the two sides fought in intense arguments with each other, none refused to back down. As her fans insisted the post ‘<em>My wife has been recently good’</em> showed fabricated evidence and nonsense, several official big verified accounts then swept the internet with their overwhelming support for Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p><strong>[Li Bo Verified: While I was working with Yu Yaoyao’s </strong> <strong>in the </strong><em><strong>‘Golden Age Empress,’</strong></em><strong> I chanced upon meeting Mr. Shen and his child who were visiting the set. Upon first glance, the couple had an excellent relationship, and the family is complete.</strong> <strong>I hope some people will stop spreading false information, hurting others in turn.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Zhou Qiu Verified: After seeing with my own eyes Yu Yaoyao’s childlike performance, I wholly believe @Yu Yaoyao. And who are hypocrites also perform deceitfully.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[In the Limelight Freshman Group Verified: All clips and screenshots attached on this post genuine. An artist’s talent and work ethic is their sole foundation; without this, even a building that reaches to the heavens will collapse.</strong> <strong>Once again, Meng Xinran’s withdrawal has nothing to do with Yu Yaoyao, but her own problem.]</strong></p>
<p>Rising stars of the <em>In the Limelight </em>competition and the crew from <em>Golden Age Empress </em>all tweeted their side, rallying their support behind Yu Yaoyao. Even the spectators were busy eating their popcorns, was given another shock.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran, who starred as the main actress in Li Bo’s new play, didn’t receive the support from the director. To add insult to injury, Li Bo remained mute about her performance, going on to praise Yu Yaoyao only. <em>In the Limelight</em> cast even went as far as to suggest Meng Xinran had a problem with her character. Pointing this directly as the reason of her withdrawal from the competition.</p>
<p>Everyone hadn’t yet the time to leave comments under these heavyweight supporters to scold the gossipmongers when an even more shattering statement greeted them!</p>
<p><strong>[Shen Yichong Verified: ‘</strong><em><strong>My wife has been recently good’</strong></em><strong> is true. Furthermore, it is official news that Guangxin Entertainment will halt all of Meng Xinran’s projects, and will sue her for misconduct and a serious breach of contract in the name of the company. Lastly, for slandering my wife @Yu Yaoyao, I will file a suit against her under my name.]</strong></p>
<p>And attached under this massive company statement, were two letters from lawyers.</p>
<p>As soon as the last boss came out, all the popcorn eaters cried excitedly.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t Shen moving at lightning speed?! For a boss who rarely appears publicly, he is here finally! He is the madam’s iron protection!</em></p>
<p>Not given a moment to breathe, the microblog greeted them with another statement.</p>
<p><strong>[Shen Yichong V: #</strong><em><strong>My wife has been recently good. </strong></em><strong>My wife’s career is as unshakable as that of her company.</strong> <strong>If you want to come and slander her, you can try.]</strong></p>
<p>The popcorn-eating group, and even the newly established fans of Yu Yaoyao were soon thrilled. This tweet was a blatant declaration of his wife’s supremacy! The big boss Shen, who is rich and powerful, has finally shown his domineering side!</p>
<p>These groups who followed after Yu Yaoyao immediately waved their flags in victorious cry and cheered for their boss Shen!</p>
<p><strong>[Chief Shen! How many times are you going to make my YY dizzy tonight?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I heard that my sister YY is recovering from an illness, let’s all lighten up a bit.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[When will we get a second cub!? I am going to tend this hot search every day. Shen, you have to be fast!]</strong></p>
