            <p><strong>Chapter 438</strong></p>
<p>He would usually only check it out when he was free, but notifications were turned off for most of the time.</p>
<p>Both Ni Yi and his assistant were also in the group so that they could monitor it if needed. Luckily, there hadn’t been any major trouble so far.</p>
<p>But today, many people were actually tagging him.</p>
<p><em>[@‘My wife is doing pretty good recently’, come out and get your red envelope.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Where is he? You’ve also worked hard writing a clarification article for Yaoyao. Now that Yaoyao has given birth to a baby, the group owner and management have also given out red envelopes. Come get yours!]</em></p>
<p><em>[‘Plate of Small White Flower’ sent you an exclusive red envelope.]</em></p>
<p><em>[‘I am the president’ sent you an exclusive red envelope.]</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Shen Yi Chong squinted. Many red packets in the group were actually sent directly to him.</p>
<p>For a while, Shen Yichong didn’t know what to say. He had complicated feelings. His youngest daughter was born. Theoretically, he should have given out red envelopes in the group, but now it was the other way around. Everyone was sending him money instead.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s fans… they were really different. Shen Yichong was a little emotional.</p>
<p>His notifications were constantly jumping. He had no choice but to receive the red envelopes before they continued tagging him.</p>
<p>In the end, he received nearly 200 Yuan.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt sensitive. It was the first time he received a red envelope in a group. During the New Year holidays, or when the company projects made a lot of money, he was usually the one who gave red envelopes to the employees in the company group. Even at home, he was the one who gave red envelopes to his wife and son. Since childhood, his parents were divorced. They never spent much time with him during the New Year, let alone gave him New Year red envelopes.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong suddenly felt a little warmth inside his chest. He had a good understanding of human relationships, but he had never liked to associate with people. Apart from business dealings and work partners, he had few friends with whom he could chat with.</p>
<p><em>[You finally got up? I thought you were gone!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Right. I also didn’t see you at the awards ceremony yesterday. Did you get too immersed in it?]</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled lightly. He looked at the group list and found that the ‘Plate of Small White Flowers’, who had previously contacted him to write the draft, was also online.</p>
<p>Chen Lin said that he sent her a solicitation message on Weibo, but she rejected them. Not sure if she thought that was a scam, or was she really not interested. He shook his head. Then, he sent red envelopes to the group.</p>
<p><em>[My Wife is Doing Pretty Good Recently: Sharing happiness.]</em></p>
<p><em>As soon as the red envelopes appeared in the group, everyone was snatching them! In an instant, someone with fast hands screamed in joy.</em></p>
<p><em>[Damn! I got 130! Are you a rich dude?!]</em></p>
<p><em>[What the..I got 86! Bro, you still lack friends?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Holy! ​​Are you an invisible billionaire?! 500 red envelopes! ! ! I also got 109 Yuan, oh my god, how much did you give in total!?]</em></p>
<p><em>[‘My Wife is Doing Pretty Good Recently’, how old are you, are you single? Are you still missing a girlfriend or wife? Or do you need a buddy?!]</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled. He turned off his phone and did not reply. He disinfected his hands and sat next to his baby daughter again. Then, he smiled foolishly at his little girl.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ye Yun, the vice president of fan management, slowly felt that something was wrong. She was also quick and got one of the red envelopes. She got lucky and received 156 Yuan.</p>
<p>Just like what everyone in the group said, this low-key person was probably really a billionaire. People who had already drawn their red envelopes had received an average of about 100. 500 red envelopes simply meant that at least 50,000 Yuan or more had been sent.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people would choose an auspicious number when they gave out red envelopes. So, it was likely to be a large total of 66666 or 88888 Yuan.</p>
<p>He spent so much money just on red envelopes that were given out for fun?! Who could this be? An ordinary fan!?</p>
<p>Ye Yun frowned. She was also a middle-level manager. Although her financial conditions were not bad, she would still have to think about it before giving out a red envelope that was worth 6666 Yuan. Even so, it would usually only be given to her subordinates.</p>
<p>Just who could this person be?</p>
<p>The last time she asked for his help on Weibo, he also didn’t reply until the next morning. Was it because he was resting at night, or was it because he was working overtime? Could he be an elderly, white-collar elite, or a boss?</p>
<p>The more Ye Yun thought about it, the more interesting this person became. She found the private message she sent to him last time. At the time, she sent a lot of messages, but he only replied with an ‘ok’.</p>
<p>But she soon saw the message sent to her by another stranger in the private message record.</p>
<p>It was Chen Lin from Guangxin. He sent her a lot of messages asking her if she would be interested in working for Guangxin, as a manager in the marketing or strategy department. But she did not accept it at the time.</p>
<p>On one hand, she was very busy with work and had no time to interview for new positions. On the other hand, she also felt that she had to separate her interest from work although she was chasing a star. But now that she saw it again, she felt that something was fishy.</p>
<p>The time gap between this person’s text and the time ‘My Wife’ replied to her was too close!</p>
<p>As she continued to investigate, she found the time ‘My wife’ spent online… Then, her eyes grew wider and wider.</p>
