            <p><strong>Chapter 194 – Blossoming Feelings</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: SM</em><br>
<em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>“Indeed, this character has this kind of weakness controlled by desire.” Zhou Lin added.</p>
<p>Just that one sentence and Shen Yichong, who was here to visit his wife, wore a dull face.</p>
<p>This was the first time Yu Haiquan saw the boss come over and visit his wife. When he looked at him, he saw his dark expression. He immediately stepped back and kept his distance from Yu Yaoyao. Zhou Lin was taken aback as well, but instead, greeted Shen Yichong and noticed the ‘My Wife and I’ cameramen recording.</p>
<p>He laughed, and quipped, “Shen Yichong always comes to declare sovereignty, huh? You’re just in time for the kissing scene. After the filming, I will return your wife to you.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows wrinkled then glanced coolly at Yu Haiquan.</p>
<p>“This…” Yu Haiquan hadn’t had the time to explain.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was taken away directly by the makeup artist and Shen Yichong went to her recliner and began to read her script.</p>
<p>Yu Haiquan looked wistfully at Zhou Lin.</p>
<p><em>Director, you are killing me! You just said something like undressing her that really pissed off the boss! </em></p>
<p>“Why? This is not wrong. It’s normal. You’re just acting together. You are both doing this because that’s what’s in the script.” Zhou Lin stared at him without remorse.</p>
<p>“That’s not true, Director..” Yu Haiquan really wanted to cry right now.</p>
<p>“Go to the dressing room now and change clothes! I have no time to teach you professional ethics!”</p>
<p>The professional ethics of an actor dictated that they play roles, no matter what it was, in accordance with the script. On the set, the scene would take precedence. Even if the male and female lead were just friends or had a significant other, or even if one of the characters was married, the filming of intimate scenes was to be played as per the script. Especially in the past few years, filming fake kisses had gone out of fashion.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao did not make a request to refuse filming kissing scenes earlier so she had to complete every detail of her part of the script. Even if Shen Yichong was present, Zhou Lin did not hesitate to shoot this section as planned, nor did he avoid looking at the man.</p>
<p>However, after Yu Yaoyao had changed into a palace dress and stepped out, she spotted Shen Yichong at a glance. She screamed a little and put her hand over her face.</p>
<p>Her face is hot!</p>
<p>It’s also as red as rose!</p>
<p>Her heart was throbbing quickly!</p>
<p>The crew of ‘My Wife and I’ comprised quite the many. To boot, the filming area was occupied by too much staff. Shen Yichong sat beside Ni Yi, his assistant Chen Lin was behind him. But she still saw her husband sitting there at a glance.</p>
<p>The handsome man wearing an elegant trench coat with a black scarf around his neck showed a trace of seriousness on his face. He looked much more handsome than Yu Haiquan who was her on-screen partner.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao quickly stretched out her hand and touched her chest. Her tiny heart was beating rapidly.</p>
<p>“Well, Yaoyao don’t look at your husband! Come over and let’s finish this scene. Then we can call this a day!”</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao did not hear Zhou Lin’s words, her cheeks were pink, and she felt that her entire body was lost in the presence of her husband.</p>
<p><em>Ah, I didn’t think when he held and kissed me last night, it would make me a little bit shy today…</em></p>
<p>She turned around anxiously and asked the makeup artist who helped her drag the skirt behind her, “Do I look good right now?” She brushed her long hair and the gold veil on her face. “There’s no place that needs improvement, right?”</p>
<p>The makeup artist nodded. “Everything looks good.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was relieved.</p>
<p>When she walked in front of the camera and heard the instructions of the director about kissing, her face turned red quickly. She tried to recall what had happened last night. She’d thought that she was sucking a person’s lips in her dream… It seemed like his mouth tasted like mint. She quickly glanced at Shen Yichong and found that his black eyes were looking at her as if he were studying her wholly. Mortified by his gaze, she moved away in panic.</p>
<p>Her heart seemed to be palpitating. She opened her lips slightly. Zhou Lin scowled when she didn’t answer him.  But when he turned to look at her, he noticed her pink cheeks. He smiled and nodded.</p>
<p><em>This girl is very dedicated. The filming has not yet started but she is already immersed in the character of Yu Ji.</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was now standing next to Ni Yi, slightly furrowed his eyebrows, his cold eyes swept towards Ni Yi. “Did she cause trouble again?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi felt guilty and didn’t dare to look at him. Instead, he just shook his head. “No, she was praised by the director.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned and looked at the camera. Before, whenever he visited her on the set, she would run to him and fall into his arms like a little quail and hold him desperately. Today… not only did she not rush over, but she fled away the moment she caught sight of him.</p>
<p>He looked back at the cameraman of ‘My Wife and I’. At first, he didn’t like to hug her in front of many people. But now that she didn’t care about him while she’s filming, he inexplicably felt that something was missing!</p>
<p>And while he was lost in his thoughts, he discovered that Yu Yaoyao was already hugged by a young male actor! He had read the script long ago and knew that there was too much physical contact such as hugs and kisses, but when he personally saw things in motion, he couldn’t help feeling anxious.</p>
