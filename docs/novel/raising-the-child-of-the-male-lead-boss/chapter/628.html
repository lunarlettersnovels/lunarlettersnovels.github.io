            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 124 – A Mother Feeding Her Family</strong></p>
<p><em>It isn’t the case?</em> They couldn’t understand how she could be so miserable, looking piteously at the waiter who handed out their packed lunches. Her sniffed with a bright, red nose, leaving everyone blank.</p>
<p>But the staff currently felt even more upset than her. He felt as if he had just bullied a sensitive, beautiful woman. In the end, he could only say, “There are still three uneaten meals left. If you like, you can take them with you to eat at home.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s crying suddenly halted. As if the sun had finally appeared in her being, she lit up. Just a moment ago, she was expressing her grief, and in the next second she was already elated!</p>
<p>Clearly, tears were still swirling in her eyes, but her red lips had already widened in amazement. She couldn’t even wait to stretch out the little hand grasping the plastic bag.</p>
<p>“Is it a delicious chicken leg? Or the sparkling braised pork?” As she spoke, she snapped her mouth as if she were swallowing saliva. Her face was still extremely pale, but her eyes glistened in contrast.</p>
<p>There was a complete silence, but soon, some people filled the air with their laughter.</p>
<p>The chief director didn’t resist laughing either. “Whatever it is, you take it with you! If you can’t come in tomorrow, I’ll have the packed lunch delivered to your hotel room as long as you can eat it.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately stopped crying and exclaimed. She held out her hand to receive the packed lunch but momentarily paused her movements.</p>
<p>For a moment, she seemed to be in deep thought, and finally she grinned and stretched out her fingers. “I want five.”</p>
<p>A frown was instantly on Shen Yichong’s face.</p>
<p>“Since I’m not in good health, I’ll take one. Then another for little Yi, little Chen Lin, and for my husband… I’ll take two.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong deadpan face broke, he was startled to see her serious face.</p>
<p>His share? <em>What the hell is this?</em></p>
<p>The chief director chuckled, “Boss Shen has a good appetite.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded earnestly in reply, “He has to do some physical work tonight, which should be a bit tiring, so he’ll need to eat more tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The chief director was startled, but immediately burst out laughing. All the men in vicinity understood!</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, please write down the details!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk nonsense.” Shen Yichong didn’t talk to liven the atmosphere. His big hands directly held the back of her neck, the delicate and smooth texture of her skin against his strong palm making him feel quite dazed.</p>
<p>In that second, Yu Yaoyao looked up at him and gave him a soft smile. “I know there’s still my baby’s share, but he needs to eat the meal cooked by the nanny for children that’s easier to digest.”</p>
<p>The gloomy expression on Shen Yichong’s face melted.</p>
<p><em>She is more reliable than before and know that I think about my son…</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao saw the stirrings of a smile appear on his mouth, but it disappeared so fast that she thought she had only been hallucinating. But there was an unmistakable warmth—his temperature is higher than it usually was.</p>
<p>“You have symptoms of vomiting. So, you’ll have to follow your son and eat porridge that is easy to digest. Many thanks to the director, but we won’t be taking home the packed lunch.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao suddenly jerked and froze. It was a bolt of lightning from out of the blue!</p>
<p>She sat in her place limply prompting Shen Yichong to lift her up. He took the plastic bag from her hands and had it discarded.</p>
<p>Sadly, none of the meal was going to return to her stomach.</p>
<p><em>No more box lunch? Porridge…?!</em></p>
<p>“No…” she began to wail.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk, stay calm.”</p>
<p>As if afraid of her vomiting a second time, Shen Yichong asked Ni Yi for some hot water. He didn’t give her another chance to speak. Holding her by the waist with his large arm, he took his leave, leaving the staff and other contestants.</p>
<p>But as soon as they left, the chief director excitedly howled at his groundhog. “Did you capture that on camera? Don’t tell me you turned it off right after she vomited!”</p>
<p>It was a pity that she heaved her lunch and cried because of it. But when she heard the offer, she wanted to take three more lunchboxes and finally laughed. Such was Yu Yaoyao’s essence who could make people naturally smile.</p>
<p>Once broadcasted, it would put their show on a super bright spot!</p>
<p>“I got it!” Being with her for days, photographer Lao Zheng has finally understood Yu Yaoyao’s personality.</p>
<p>She appears like a ditzy person, but he found it was never an act since she does it was an unconscious act on her part. He can’t relax his guard anytime, in fear that she would do something strange that was worth filming and seeing.</p>
<p>Lao Zheng also added with a hint of excitement on his face, “I also took some pictures of the interaction between the two couples.”</p>
<p>He listened to their conversation, like a proud grandfather, finding it adorable.</p>
<p>The chief director slapped his thigh merrily, “Good job!”</p>
<p>However, the staff were a little worried. “Isn’t boss Shen a private person?”</p>
<p>“What are you afraid of? Just blur his face!” The chief director shook his head dismissively.  “By the way, Guanbo put out a trailer immediately! Hurry up and edit Yu Yaoyao’s scenes later!”</p>
