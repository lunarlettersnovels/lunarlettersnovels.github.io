            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 214 – Untimely Visitor (3)</strong></p>
<p>His head got a little confused, and could not handle so much information.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, knowing that his son’s addiction to asking why came again, and now he could not satisfy him easily.</p>
<p>But it was necessary to let his son understand some problems.</p>
<p>Overprotection sometimes was a kind of hurt and deceit.</p>
<p>“Your mom’s dad, your grandpa, divorced your grandma, and when you mommy was a child, he married a new wife, and that is the grandma you know now….”</p>
<p>Shen Rui opened his mouth and looked at Yu Xinjie.</p>
<p>“So Auntie is the child of Grandpa … and new Grandma.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded and peeled the shrimp for him.</p>
<p>But Shen Rui lost his appetite even when looking at his favorite shrimp, he glanced at the second floor and got anxious.</p>
<p>“Daddy, you can’t marry a new wife, I don’t want a new mommy!”</p>
<p>“If you have a new baby with another person, no matter if it is a brother or sister, I will ignore him, and I won’t play with him!”</p>
<p>“If you marry another person, and don’t want my mommy, Rui doesn’t want you too, Daddy!”</p>
<p>Though the child meant no offense to her in the middle of his tirade, it was the truest feeling.</p>
<p>And in that one sentence made Yu Xinjie’s face worse than eating a fly.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie clenched her fists.</p>
<p>She remembered when she was little, her mother came to pick her up at the elementary school, and Yu Yaoyao’s mother came.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s mother slapped her mother right in front of the school entrance.</p>
<p>The next day, all the classmates asked her, did her mom steal someone else’s dad, if she is a child of a mistress, if she is an unlawful daughter, someone even said that her mom is dirty….</p>
<p>More and more people gave her peculiar looks at school!</p>
<p>That was when she swore that she would take everything away from Yu Yaoyao, and make her and her mother regret it!</p>
<p>The ones who were being despised, and lost everything, must be them!</p>
<p>“Rui, you’re still young so you don’t understand.” Yu Xinjie gritted her teeth, “Adults’ world is complicated, your dad may like someone today, but it might be different tomorrow.…”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She was still yelling at Shen Rui, and suddenly heard the man’s calm voice.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie stared at the man at the dining table.</p>
<p>From her angle, she could only see Shen Yichong’s dropping face, as before, his face was tranquil and … cold.</p>
<p>But his voice was conversely soft.</p>
<p>“As long as your mommy’s here, daddy won’t marry other people.” He rubbed his son’s head and promised him assuredly. “Let alone have a child with another woman.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong peeled another shrimp for his son and put it into his small bowl.</p>
<p>“Here, eat it.” Shen Rui took a serious look at his dad, then finally nodded in relief, and while putting the shrimp into his small mouth, he looked braggingly at Yu Xinjie who had just yelled at him.</p>
<p>“My dad is not going to marry a new wife, I only have one mommy!” he announced triumphantly.</p>
<p>“Then maybe your mom….” Yu Xinjie couldn’t help but feel as mad as hell when she was cut off immediately.</p>
<p>“Shut up.” Shen Yichong told her, frowning in the process. The tone of his voice stopped Yu Xinjie, making her choke on her rage.</p>
<p>When did things become completely different?! She’d only been gone for one semester!</p>
<p>And this man was defending that stupid woman Yu Yaoyao?! No! She won’t allow it!</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and looked at the camera on her peripheral. He must have said it all because of the TV show!</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie pretended to slap her mouth, “Oh look what am I talking about in front of a child, how silly am I! My sister loves her son the most!”</p>
<p>The cameramen might not know, but Shen Yichong and Shen Rui all knew, she was talking the opposite!</p>
<p>Especially Shen Rui, Yu Yaoyao never hugged him before, every time she came to visit, the kid never dared to approach Yu Yaoyao, having a dodging look like an abandoned child!</p>
<p>Haha!</p>
<p>Even though he was born in a rich family, so what? He had no maternal love and low self-esteem, even in kindergarten, he was being scoffed at by other people!</p>
<p>Even worse than her!</p>
<p>To blame, blame Yu Yaoyao for her sin!</p>
<p>“My little Rui, it’s about to be your birthday, is your mommy going to buy you cake and toys?”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie knew too well how to hurt the heart of this kid. She knew that what she just said would increase the suspicion between them and Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>However, she made a mistake this time!</p>
<p>Soon a delicate and joyful voice passed down from the second floor.</p>
<p>“Sis, I’m going to take the money from you, for the toy that I’m getting for my baby Rui~”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s voice arrived before herself.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie raised her head wordlessly and saw Yu Yaoyao happily walking down the stairs, twisting her waist, and holding a small red notebook in her hand.</p>
