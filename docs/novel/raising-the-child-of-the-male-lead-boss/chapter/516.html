            <p><strong>Chapter 247 – Another Little Bun (2)</strong></p>
<p>Director Zhou immediately jumped on the safety mat, “Little Yu, you are pregnant?! Why didn’t you tell me earlier? The jump…why did you attempt it?!” he thundered, and glared at Shen Yichong, “Neither husband nor wife thought it appropriate to inform me in advance?”</p>
<p>If the director and the crew were notified, emergency precautions would have been placed. The reporters needed nothing more than this. This was icing on a cake! A fuel to the fire that was already burning.</p>
<p>They directed their cameras at Gu Qianqian’s shocked and confused face at that very moment. They would hound her and create massive headlines blaming her for Yu’s miscarriage, if it was even true. Gu Qianqian looked at Yu Yaoyao and felt an intense hatred. If she could push her off that safety net, she would fall off. What a scandal that would be! <em>It would possibly rank number 1 in today’s hot topic, </em>thought Gu Qianqian vehemently.</p>
<p>The reporters whisked their phones out and called the headquarters to alert the staff and writers. They lowered their voice while reporting, but Gu Qianqian heard them, nonetheless. Everything she heard was so terrible.</p>
<p>One of them exclaimed excitedly, “Hey, Editor-in-Chief here. I have a hot topic here. Gu Qianqian embarrassed Yu Yaoyao in the scene. Yu Yaoyao is even suspected of having a miscarriage because of the fall and the stress. No, they haven’t gone to the hospital yet, she has a stomachache…”</p>
<p>Another blabbered in his phone, “Do you hear me, Old Zhang? Yu Yaoyao is almost unconscious. She looks pale. Get that on paper. Suspected of miscarriage.”</p>
<p>Yet another one droned, “Yes, yes, Lil’ Chen. Yu Yaoyao might be admitted to the hospital, might have lost a child. The director asked Gu Qianqian why she slapped Yu Yaoyao without warning. She is the culprit of one dead body and two lives… put that in. I will go to the hospital later.”</p>
<p>The reporters made no effort to verify the information. This was how the tabloids worked. Even if they were to correct the headlines and the published articles with the right information later, the damage would already be done. It would have garnered massive attention, and the correct information wouldn’t matter. Even if some reporters weren’t going to frame Gu Qianqian before, they now jumped the wagon and painted her as the evil, heartless baby-killer.</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian couldn’t take it anymore. She had her reputation at stake. “Don’t talk nonsense,” she shouted, “I didn’t hit her!” She never meant anything like this to happen. She had envied Yu Yaoyao and vented her anger in the scene, but she never wanted to have any kind of animosity with her, let alone cause her to have a miscarriage!</p>
<p>“The slap was part of the script,” she lied, “The Director was present! I didn’t actually hit her. I was merely acting; I didn’t hit her for real!” Gu Qianqian was trying to demonstrate how they did it in the scene.</p>
<p>“We just do it like this,” she said, waving her hand around, “Actors don’t physically slap one another. And Yu Yaoyao caught my hand, anyway. I didn’t even touch her!” But Gu Qianqian had raised her right hand, the one she said was injured. The reporters caught this in an instant.</p>
<p>“Ms. Gu, didn’t you say that hand was injured? Were you lying?” Gu Qianqian broke into a cold sweat and heaved erratic breaths.</p>
<p>“It has stopped hurting a bit…,” she said, her face flushed. <em>Yet another heading for them to taint my name, </em>she thought.</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth, “Did any of you call an ambulance for Yu Yaoyao?” she asked. That helped distract the reporters from her.</p>
<p>“Boss, I am already on the line. Please remain calm,” said Ni Yi to Shen Yichong, holding his phone to his ear.</p>
<p>Chen Lin jumped up and snapped, “I’m going to get the car ready. I will drive. An ambulance might take some time to reach here.”</p>
<p>“No need…” Yu Yaoyao cried out weakly but was ignored.</p>
<p>Little Bun didn’t understand anything. So, he dearly held his mum’s sleeve and cried, “Mum, don’t worry. Little Rui is here with you.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at his son with an aching heart. He looked at his trembling wife. <em>Baby… </em>he thought, <em>but how? </em>They hadn’t been intimate with each other for a long while.</p>
<p>Director Zhou rushed in and slapped Shen Yichong over the head with rolled script papers. “Oi, stop daydreaming! Hurry and take your wife to the car. You can drive her till you catch up with the ambulance and move her into it.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong picked her up in his arms and looked at her tenderly. She raised a hand weakly…</p>
<p>“Wait… I am not—I just… my bun-bun hand warmers… the heat pack… fell…,” she said.</p>
<p>He froze, “What?”</p>
<p>The reporters and the paparazzi were all dumbfounded.</p>
<p><em>Bun-bun… heat pack?!</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at Director Zhou, confused. He then looked at his wife in his arms, the corners of his mouth twitching.</p>
<p>“You… where did the heat pack fall?” he asked.</p>
<p>After a long pause he heard her reply feebly, “Now it’s on my thighs….”</p>
<p>Speaking of which, she must have made a confusing error… the human language was still complicated as ever to a snake spirit after all.</p>
<p>“Don’t call the ambulance, please. Everyone is thinking too much…,” she said softly, a shy expression on her face. Shen Yichong rubbed the bridge of his nose. He didn’t know how to face Director Zhou.</p>
<p>“I just thought of Rui and accidentally called it a bun-bun,” she said sheepishly. Her pale, crying face had given Director Zhou a scare. He couldn’t process what he was hearing for a while. Nobody made a noise; the set was as silent as it had ever been.</p>
<p>Ni Yi hung up. Everybody was stunned and stared at Yu Yaoyao. Only Gu Qianqian clenched her fist, her face a picture of rage.</p>
