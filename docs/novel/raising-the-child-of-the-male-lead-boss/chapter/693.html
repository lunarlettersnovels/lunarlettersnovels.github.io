            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 58 – Preliminary Chaos</strong></p>
<p>All the artists entered their allocated rooms and leaving Ni Yi, and some a few managers who didn’t feel at ease.</p>
<p>The director in charge of the outside field immediately picked up the microphone to announce the rules for the preliminary part of the competition, “For the first preliminary match, there will be a live broadcast for 8 hours followed by a short video summary of the first 24 hours.”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow morning at 9 o’clock, the ranking will be revised according to the latest number of votes, and the lowest 20 will be eliminated.”</p>
<p>“Re-ranking!” Ni Yi, who was leaning on the wall, looked even more ghastly as cold sweat spouted from his forehead instantly.</p>
<p><em>A live broadcast?!</em></p>
<p>“Finished…finished…” he could only sag the wall pitifully. His sister’s fanbase already has a low number of fans. Among the 88 other artists present, at least more than half of them had far more fans than her.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, they will fall from the first place in just a short time… to become the lowest-ranking contestant!</p>
<p>While he was having a mental breakdown, the outside field director diligently continued to tell the rules.</p>
<p>“Behind the door for every room, there will be a prearranged topic for the contestant to perform. Everyone can freely use the items inside the room or in their luggage as props. Furthermore, there will be a group of acting coaches to watch the live broadcast and evaluate. If a contestant’s performance is deemed <em>irrelevant </em>to the topic, the coach will punish by deducting 500 votes from said contestant. Now the countdown is ten minutes! Everyone may arrange their respective rooms in ready for the broadcast. If there is confusion, you can ask the assistant director or staff.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi panicked as he watched the online broadcast of the director, then he hurriedly went to their official weibo account.</p>
<p>Sure enough, news of the latest rules for the groups in the program has already been posted for the public to see.</p>
<p>He looked at Meng Xinran’s channel and other newcomers with small fanbases, who had already shared the official rules for the preliminary part of the program, allowing fans to enthusiastically praise and comment under the main post.</p>
<p>In just two minutes, the difference between the contestant’s number of fans has already showed up!</p>
<p>Of the 88 live channels, 12 were well ahead, where thousands of viewers, mostly their fans, have joined the channel instantly. The views were even picking up quite quickly in just a short amount of time, until the number of viewers playing the reached tens of thousands…</p>
<p>However, the most pitiful contestants, the really unknown newcomers with small fanbases, had only a few audiences in their channel.</p>
<p><em>This competition system! This rule! </em>Ni Yi almost vomited blood!</p>
<p>Is the director brain-dead?</p>
<p>This wasn’t a competition on who was the better actor, it was clearly more of a battle of who had more fans! It is blatantly clear that those who have the fewest number of fans will be eliminated first in the preliminary round!</p>
<p>Ni Yi recited Amitabha Buddha three times before he entered Yu Yaoyao’s live channel.</p>
<p>At the first glance, his became black immediately. The current number of online viewers were only 23.</p>
<p>Okay, he should think on the positive side! This was better than having no views at all!</p>
<p>But when he glanced at the comment left on the live channel, he vomited blood.</p>
<p><strong><em>[Isn’t this that ancestral actress from that acting scandal years ago?]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[I thought ‘In the Limelight’ would be a just show, but boy, was I wrong. Is voting for this garbage program even worth the VIP membership I bought for?! What a slag! Why would they even let her in!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[It must be another ‘backstage operation’. The directors of this program must have been bribed with a huge amount of cash behind the scenes!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[Shame on You! That’s right, I only came her to scold! All right, I’m going back to Ranran’s channel to look at her lovely face!]</em></strong></p>
<p>Ni Yi, seeing all these roast comments, could not really help but sweat profusely.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes, new netizens went inside Yu Yaoyao’s channel, only to keep coming in to leave spiteful comments and leave; this continued on for a long while.</p>
<p>After all, it was not too long ago that her name had appeared in the hot search, which made this keyboard warriors be familiar with her…her channel was submerged in a foul atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the moment, Yu Yaoyao was sitting comfortably on the makeup stool inside the first room with her legs crossed, her face free from worries with only a calm expression on place.</p>
<p>This was her first time to be in a live broadcast, therefore, she wasn’t very familiar with the mechanics. Only after fiddling for a while, was she able to turn the camera on and start her live broadcast–a second before 9 o’clock.</p>
<p>The number of people watching her channel by then was 54.</p>
