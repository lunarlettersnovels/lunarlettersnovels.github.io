            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 234 – They Never Learn (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Dict Groiler</em></p>
<p><em>Proofreader: Livyuna</em></p>
<p>Ni Yi’s eyes lit up and he leaned over immediately.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao quickly dialed the number on the phone, when she saw Ni Yi’s anxious expression, she immediately put the phone on loudspeaker mode. When the call was picked up by the receiver, Yu Yaoyao spoke in a charming tone,</p>
<p>“Husband, someone is bullying me~” As she said this, she threw a wink at Ni Yi and motioned at him to come closer.</p>
<p>Ni Yi then started talking in an excited manner, he spoke extremely fast as if he was being chased and told everything that had transpired prior and after the incident.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted as she listened to him recount the events, and when she finally couldn’t keep quiet she interjected, “Husband, I wasn’t late to the shoot.”</p>
<p>There was silence on the other end of the phone, and Shen Yichong’s voice soon came out of the receiver.</p>
<p>“Return home. You don’t need to shoot anymore.” He stated in a calm tone, unlike his usual stern voice. “As for today’s matter, I will notify the PR Department to coordinate and find a lawyer to hold them accountable for their treatment of you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was stunned by his answer, “No need for me to shoot anymore? But that’s going to be three million down the drain!”</p>
<p>She had taken up the job since she was currently lacking in finances. If she doesn’t film, she won’t get paid. What about her money? Afterall, shooting a single advertisement can earn several meals!</p>
<p>“No way! Husband, wouldn’t we lose all that money if I don’t accept?”</p>
<p>“Ten minutes ago, in the latest news release, it was stated that Chen Jiao had become the spokesperson for the main production line of the Crocker Diamond Family Group.” Yu Yaoyao was informed by him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was silent for a while, before talking to her again.</p>
<p>“We have money back at home, the situation isn’t as dire as you make it to be.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to suffer on their behalf.” He added.</p>
<p>“So they want to shift alliances to Brother Chen Jiao and are thus deliberately making things difficult for us?” Ni Yi grasped the situation in an instant.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao is merely endorsing a sub-company of the Crocker Diamond Family Group, such wasn’t as comparable in status to Chen Jiao’s who was the main spokesperson of the whole line.</p>
<p>Now that both parties – That is, Yu Yaoyao and Chen Jiao – Are on the opposing sides of the tug of war, it would be hypocritical for Yu Yaoyao, who is currently riding a trough, to be endorsing the same product as Chen Jiao, she was standing on the same stage as him!</p>
<p>The pieces of the puzzle started falling into place.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was silent for a while as her thoughts preoccupied her, after some time, she at last figured what must have happened. Human beings are really complicated creatures.</p>
<p>She quickly shook her head dismissively as she turned to answer her husband, “No, I won’t withdraw. Husband. I don’t want to drop the endorsement~”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong did not have the time to reply to her, for Yu Yaoyao once again spoke.</p>
<p>“Wait for me at home. I’ll make money for you!” She announced before ending the call. After Yu Yaoyao finished speaking, Ni Yi looked at her with a dumbfounded expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Sister, let’s withdraw from the shoot today, and listen to Presi…” Before he could finish his words, the Producer, Fang Jia Zijie, smiled and blocked the door.</p>
<p>“Backing out?” He sneered. “Well, the penalty is 10 million, I can waive this fee for you. Interested?” Jia Zijie’s strange demeanor made Yu Yaoyao raise her eyebrows, and stare at him head on. “You see, you really don’t have to shoot. Truth is, we also want to change the ambassador. Your image is not in line with our main concept,” Jia Zijie proceeded to explain.</p>
<p>“If you are willing to take the initiative to breach the contract, it will be for the better. We shall terminate the contract peacefully. As for today’s wasted site fee, we won’t charge a penalty on you for it. Take the offer while it’s still on the plate.”</p>
<p>WIth an expression of wanting to chew Yu Yaoyao to death, he looked as thoroughly amused as he could be at the situation.</p>
<p>Ni Yi gaped at him in disbeleif.</p>
<p>It turned out that their product vendors had long wanted to change their ambassador, but didn’t want to unilaterally propose to terminate the collaboration and bear the high cost for breaching the contract. Instead, they deliberately wanted to beat his sister down so she would propose nullifying the contract instead! Insidious! Despicable!</p>
<p>The director’s advertising team, who had treated them so poorly, must have been instructed by the product manufacturer to conduct themselves as such in order to bully them to defeat.</p>
<p>As Ni Yi figured the scheming behind the scenes, he felt that the anger within his chest might have ruptured an artery or two.</p>
<p>Jia Zijie squinted at them and said, “We, the Diamond Group, belong to the Crocker Group. The endorsements of the sub-branches cannot conflict with the endorsements of the main branch.”</p>
<p>“The status quo of this company doesn’t suit you, and you two must have understood it by now?” He finished with a haughty look on his face.</p>
<p>Ni Yi gritted his teeth and asked, “Then what about before? Why did you want to sign with us then?”</p>
<p>“Chen Jiao did not announce his departure then. Guangxin once became a sponsor of “In the Limelight”, and as one of the chief judges, he had personally selected his boss’ wife as the first place. But now…” Jia Zijie paused, “You are already opponents. You belong to different companies and are always pitted against each other, throat to throat. At the very least the fans on both sides are already extremely opposed to each other.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao fans went to scold Chen Jiao for having no conscience last night, and scolded him for destroying the second little bun they were expecting.</p>
<p>Ni Yi glared at Jia Zijie angrily, and turned around, “Sister, let’s leave!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao kept listening, supporting her petite profile with one hand and staring at Jia Zijie, who was still standing by the door, intently.</p>
<p>“We can make a deal,” she began. “As long as you pay me the penalty for breach of contract, then that’s it, I won’t shoot for you anymore, otherwise, I will shoot the ad.”</p>
<p>Jia Zijie almost bit his tongue in astonishment. “You didn’t hear what I said? Didn’t you also plan to terminate the contract? We can terminate the contract peacefully. What do you mean by us paying you the penalty fee?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s red lips curled up, “We never stated we were going to terminate the contract, you assumed that all on your own.”</p>
