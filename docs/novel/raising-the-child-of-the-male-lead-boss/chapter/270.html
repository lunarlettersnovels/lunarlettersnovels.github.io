<p><strong>Chapter 491</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao no longer cared what others said about her. The investor of ‘Killer’ was Guangxin. She was now the major shareholder of Guangxin, which meant that she was already making so much money to the point that she could afford most expensive things and do anything she wanted to. It didn’t matter what the public said about her.</p>
<p>“Darling!” Yu Yaoyao suddenly exclaimed. Her eyes widened, turned to look at Little Sweetheart who was still kicking her legs. A memory came unbidden to her mind. She… she seemed to really have… “Darling, everyone’s right! I… I think I did ask for an amulet…” she mumbled.</p>
<p>“!!!”</p>
<p>When she said this, Shen Yichong quickly remembered those unbearable days. During that time, Yu Yaoyao wanted a second child, and became obsessed with various methods. At first, she fell in love with chicken soup. She cooked it every day, and even sent chicken soup to the company for him to drink. Later in the evening, she even refused to have sex with him, saying that the day was not suitable. He even found a wooden amulet under the pillow when he laid down to sleep.</p>
<p>She <em>did</em> ask for an amulet!</p>
<p>“Wow, it works!” Yu Yaoyao’s mouth was opened wide. “At that time, the master said that I should pick up the script of ‘Killer’ because it contained all the elements that would help me with my wish,” she laughed.</p>
<p>“Sure enough, Little Sweetheart came less than a month into the crew~” she said. Then suddenly, her eyes lit up with little sparks. She turned around and grabbed Shen Yichong’s arm excitedly. “Darling, the master does help!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, and he felt an unprecedented headache. “So…you only picked up ‘Killer’ because of the master?”</p>
<p>The way she chose a script was simply unheard of! But in the end, she had indeed made this movie a hit nonetheless. The most ominous thing was that the news that even he thought was false information turned out to be true.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt a huge headache.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted. “Well, darling, didn’t I tell you? I thought I told you.”</p>
<p>Mr. Shen, who thought he knew, could only press down the throbbing in his temples. “Not at all.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao patted him on the shoulder, “I’m sorry, darling. I really thought I told you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Huh, shall I repay my vow?! Wait, I have to ask Little Sisi!”</p>
<p>It was Little Sisi who introduced the master to her. But she never understood these things very well. It wasn’t until she saw the posts did she know she actually had to repay her vow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shen Yichong pinched between his brows. He felt a huge headache as he witnessed his wife being superstitious again.</p>
<p>“Keep your distance from these people, and don’t go anymore,” he said. “If it was Ren Sitong who said it, then I know who it is. The master is pretty famous in the industry, and you have to pay off the fee at once. Don’t go anymore.”</p>
<p>Yaoyao looked at him forlornly. “Is that so?”</p>
<p>“… Yes.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was determined not to let her continue to have any contact with these dubious people. He knew that his wife was simple-minded and easily deceived.</p>
<p>“Okay then~”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao rolled twice, and then rolled back to Little Sweetheart who was lying on the ground. She then began to make her girl laugh. Only then did Shen Yichong send a message to Chen Lin, asking the public relations department to immediately clarify the false news.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After a while, Guangxin’s official reply finally suppressed this hot search news.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao and Mr. Shen brought their children to the shooting location of the new drama in country T. They also met with the director to make active preparations for her postpartum comeback. The photo of a family of four flying down was also uploaded. It directly ended the previous hot search, saying that they left their children to go to country T.</p>
<p>There was even a photo of Little Sweetheart getting vaccinated on the day of the premiere, which broke the rumour that the couple excused themselves from the premiere without reason. They were always this fast in slapping the reporters in their faces!</p>
<p>While the YY fans felt refreshed, they also deeply regretted what they chose to believe!</p>
<p><strong>[I want to apologize, I actually thought Yaoyao was being superstitious! I’m guilty!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yaoyao is a great actor, and it wouldn’t work if you get another actress to replace her! For those who said that she only gets popular after begging for an amulet, did you spend money to watch her movies? If you’re broke, I can buy tickets for you to watch the movie. Please open your eyes and see for yourself!]</strong></p>
<p>The official statement from Guangxin was almost instantly being shared by every YY fan.</p>
<p>Even Director Liang of ‘Killer’ soon posted a message himself.</p>
<p><strong>[I never use Weibo, but I can’t turn an blind eye to the slanderous remarks.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>First of all, Ms. Yu Yaoyao read this script herself. Her assistant came to me directly and suggested that she wanted to play the heroine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Secondly, I auditioned her. She had definitely gotten the role because I saw her strength.</strong></p>
<p><strong>From the beginning to the end, there is no so-called luck, and the capital from Guangxin didn’t play a role.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In addition, regarding the premiere…Mothers won’t usually want to go to crowded places when their child has not been weaned. I hope everyone can be considerate.]</strong></p>
