<p><strong>Chapter 349</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had successfully finished filming for ‘Seven Years’, and the beauty magazine with her picture on the front cover had finally been released.</p>
<p>The sale margin was well beyond expectations.</p>
<p>The magazine not only had her as the cover, but there were also three pages containing pictures from the different themes that had been shot. Chen Jiao’s poster was included in the middle page.</p>
<p>Many YY fans and Chen Jiao fans were delighted to support this issue of the magazine.</p>
<p>The cover was one of the pictures in which she had stood, cold and indifferent, in the abandoned city scene. The first page inside was an image from the jungle scene, with her looking like a pure nymph hiding among the trees.</p>
<p>Although the YY fans had seen the photos on the internet in advance, they were shocked once again when they got the physical copy:</p>
<p><em>[Slobbering… Help!]</em></p>
<p><em>[These long legs… I can look at them for days!]</em></p>
<p><em>[My sister’s eyes are really so freaking cool!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Angels and demons. Very different from my sister’s style, but she did it so well!]</em></p>
<p><em>[This little deer’s innocent eyes! Ahhhhhhhh, my sister looks so immortal in green clothes!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’m dead… Her unruly aura has pierced me]</em></p>
<p>In the same magazine, there were poster pages of other female artists and Chen Jiao. But the fans felt that they were simply not good enough. Yu Yaoyao had defeated everyone!</p>
<p>Suddenly, #Yaoyaohusbandissofreakingsool was ranked first on the hot search again.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was once again afflicted by a pounding headache. He underestimated his wife’s abilities.</p>
<p>Originally, he thought that the image of ‘Yaoyao Husband’ would gradually fade away and cool off if Yu Yaoyao could refrain from posting on Weibo and interacting with her fans. But he was obviously mistaken. The more he tried to cover her up, the more she shone.</p>
<p>A magazine photo had put her on the hot search again and surpassed that of a male star who’d had a marital affair.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong could only helplessly accept the reality of the situation. His wife didn’t need him to buy her any online traffic at all, nor did she need any marketing plan. She could quite easily become the online traffic queen by herself. She was born with this eye-catching ability.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had wanted to turn her image into a more feminine or even a mature one, but it was obviously ineffective. He only suffered a type of backlash.</p>
<p>One after the other, groups of female fans were calling her ‘husband’. Shockingly, they also said that they wished they were laying in her arms in the photos.</p>
<p>What’s more, three days later, the organizer of the urban drama ‘Youth Without Regrets’ finally changed the script to a culinary direction, in accordance with the request from the investor, Shen Yichong. They even brought the script over.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was not impressed when he saw it.</p>
<p>The role of a bad girl.</p>
<p>In the beginning, she was addicted to alcohol, smoking, tattooing, and swearing. In the middle section, she was impressed by gourmet food. She became an apprentice to a master chef that owned a century-old restaurant facing closure. She then embarked on a journey of honing her culinary skills.</p>
<p>In the end, she fell in love with a trending CEO who was described as a clean freak with picky taste.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had no comment on the script. Afterall, it had been him who asked that the drama work towards the culinary theme. He had even suggested the theme of inspiration and struggle of a youth. But the lines inside portrayed the female protagonist as having the attitude of a secondary school student.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, Teacher Yu, take a look when you can. Please also feel free to give feedback on it. We expect to start shooting in the next two months, since teacher Yu would have a free schedule during this time,” the producer said.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned, “Is this screenwriter very young?”</p>
<p>The producer nodded, “She only recently graduated. But since we will be focusing on having a youthful theme, the story of such a screenwriter is closer to the workings of everyday life.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong wanted to comment, but Yu Yaoyao was already immersed in the script. “Not bad. I like it. Both the male and female protagonists are very funny!” she said cheerfully.</p>
<p>The male protagonist always felt sick after eating other people’s food, but never after eating anything the female protagonist made.</p>
<p>This was a standard, potent CEO drama; her favorite kind of drama!</p>
<p>The female protagonist was not a weak female that would easily cry. Instead, she was a violent woman who had no problem using her fists to deal with things that didn’t go her way. The setting was also very fresh.</p>
<p>“This could do!” Yu Yaoyao exclaimed after she had read the introduction.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong heard this, he couldn’t say anything against it. He wanted Yu Yaoyao to follow her heart.</p>
<p>The genre of the character was something she had never tried. The last time she improvised in the audition for the youth drama invested by Guangxin, she did have a strong sense of youth. The robust, reserved personality of the female protagonist in the script was great when contrasted against her gentle, soft character in real life. She might be able to discover more of her performance potential by agreeing to act in this drama.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Shen Yichong made no effort to stop her from taking the part. And Yu Yaoyao was already madly in love with the storyline. Just as though it had been a novel, she stayed up late that night and finished reading the entire script.</p>
<p>As a senior bookworm, she even added a few suggestions to revise the tiny bug she had found that could be improved upon, as well as several lines of the protagonist.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong found it a rarity to see her being so serious and devoted to a script. He felt a bubble of warmth in his chest.</p>
<p>But the corners of his mouth twitched into a frown when he overhead her on call, “How can the CEO pin me to the wall and kiss me as the elevator opens? I am a bad girl with uncanny strength. It should be me who pushes him against the wall and kisses him! And here. It says I should be taking out a freshly made pudding, feeding him, and trapping him in the parking lot so he can’t escape. It says I should be saying, “Open your mouth, you sexy beast.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had put her phone on loudspeaker so she could page easily through the script while she spoke. The voice on the other end of the phone sounded like that of a shy girl. It must be the screenwriter who had just graduated. She was clearly caught off guard because she was silent for a long while.</p>
<p>She finally reacted when Yu Yaoyao paused and for a breath, “Teacher Yu, my God, what you said makes so much sense! The scene you just described to me gave me goosebumps! I love the feel of it, and I can clearly see it in my mind!”</p>
<p>“I know it, right?” Yu Yaoyao said excitedly.</p>
<p>Obviously inspired by Yu Yaoyao’s words, the screenwriter started talking excitedly, “Yes. I’m going to change it. At first, the CEO doesn’t like the female protagonist. He felt that she was uneducated, and she was merely managing a snack stall. He hated and looked down on her. The first time he tastes her food, she must force him to eat it. And then… delicious!”</p>
<p>“Yes!” Yu Yaoyao laughed</p>
<p>“Then, the female protagonist says, “Shall I feed you, my little elf? Do you have no hands? Hah! Are you trying to get my attention?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded frantically, “Yes, yes, this is so exciting!”</p>
<p>Halfway through the call, a large hand grasped her by the back of the neck. She turned her head to look at her husband’s darkened face. “Umm… I have to go now, I’ve got something on! Just call me again if you have any questions. Bye, bye!” Yu Yaoyao quickly hung up the phone. Then she turned and stuck her tongue out at Shen Yichong, leaning against him, “Darling, you’re back? You were so quiet when you walked in, you almost scared the daylights out of me!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s expression faltered. He didn’t think she’d looked terrified at all. “Sexy beast? Kissing against the wall? Huh?” He had put himself in the CEO shoe’s and had felt instantly astonished by the mental image.</p>
<p>She wanted to press the male protagonist to the wall and feed him pudding…</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered that a while ago, she had always smiled strangely and cheerfully when he had acted indifferent towards her.</p>
<p>This woman… There was an 80% chance that she had been imagining those strange things in her head.</p>
