            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 92 – A Taste of Shame</strong></p>
<p>The beggar’s attire completely concealed her youthful appearance, especially with her back bent as she walked with timid footsteps on stage, showing her inferiority and fear.</p>
<p>“A penny please, anyone…”</p>
<p>While she knelt on the ground and spoke her designated lines, out of the corners of her eyes, she could not help but look at the handsome man in the middle of the judging panel.</p>
<p><em>Elder brother Chen! </em></p>
<p>Of course, he is a judge today! She hasn’t lost just yet!</p>
<p><em>Yu Yaoyao’s choice of the cheating madam topic, and this fateful encounter with the eldest brother Chen Jiao, will only send the brainless keyboard warriors into a frenzy from being reminded of her past scandal and criticize her.</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s dull eyes instantly brightened as this idea crossed her mind. She excitedly thought, if she could find a way…maybe she can let Chen Jiao act together with Yu Yaoyao and play infidelity on the stage?</p>
<p>This distraction made her smile and it did not match her beggar’s role.</p>
<p>But it was not until the audience burst into boos, and there was a small disgruntled discussion between judges that Meng Xinran woke up from her daydream with a start.</p>
<p>Oh, no! She just forgot she was still performing! She was too distracted to remember!</p>
<p>“I, I–” In a panic, she could only stutter as she forgot the lines she had memorized from before.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao, the judge, could not help but frown at her. His handsome face flashed a hint of disapproval, and he picked up the microphone to interrupt her performance.</p>
<p>“Forgetting your lines is an amateurish mistake. Your preparation backstage was simply not enough that even after taking the stage, you were still not ready.” He continued, “I’m sorry, Xiao Ran, even if you are my junior sister, I must be fair and admit that this mistake in your performance just wasted all the audience’s time.”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu beside him also nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>“You don’t even <em>look</em> like a beggar, but more like a panicked, big miss, fantasizing in the streets. Furthermore, that strange smile on your face just now was acted very well. Did you want to play the role of a villainous beggar? Unfortunately, you should remember that the topic is simply a road beggar. That is the starting point; your performance is totally wrong.</p>
<p>A road beggar is quite different from your displayed temperament. Even appropriate makeup cannot fully bring you into the role.” The old actor also criticized, “I’m sorry, you are far from professional standard today.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s dirty little face suddenly turned ugly.</p>
<p>The host soon organized a live vote. All of the judges did not raise their cards, even more so those at the audience; except for her fans, almost no one voted.</p>
<p>“The final vote is 213.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran body almost wavered. Of the total of 500 spectators, she only got less than half of the votes. In the previous match, the last ranking contestant almost had the same number of votes. Such a shameful result made her want the ground to open up and swallow her whole!</p>
<p>In the live performance, she made such a big mistake!</p>
<p>The host regretfully comforted her, “Don’t worry, we still have the revival competition system.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran gnashed her teeth, <em>Revival?</em></p>
<p>Are they saying that her acting was inferior and that she can only survive by external voting?!</p>
<p>“Next time, fighting.” The host motioned her to leave.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran gritted her teeth, took a step forward and bowed to the audience. “I’m sorry. To the judges, you are right–I wasn’t prepared enough today, and I wasn’t able to get into character quickly as the bridge segment I had designed is more suitable for double performance!”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu looked over the list of topics and quickly shook his head in reply. “Your topic can be completed by a single person. It is only the topic of the cheating madam suitable for a double performance.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran was clenching her fists, her eyes red and her voice trembled uncontrollably. “Then I’m willing to vouch for the contestant after me! I hope the director’s group would allow for the cheating madam topic to become a double performance! I made a mistake, but I don’t want the next player to make the same mistake!”</p>
<p>If she’s humiliated, then she’ll bring down Yu Yaoyao down with her!</p>
