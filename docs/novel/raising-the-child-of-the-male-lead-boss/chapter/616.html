<p><strong>Chapter 136 – Queen of Advertisement (2)</strong></p>
<p>Different flavors of a delectable treat littered inside, like a treasure waiting. Milk, caramel, almond, banana, strawberry, chocolate, mango, and so on…</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao peered into the open snack box, she couldn’t get the yearning from her glistening eyes and immediately stretched out a to seize the pudding! A small bed next to her lays her unsuspecting son, played by a child actor, pretending he was asleep.</p>
<p>“Darling, I’m so sorry, ah! Mommy will eat this…”</p>
<p>She casually points to the pile of flavors with her eyes closed, torn between embarrassment on stealing her child’s snacks, and curiosity. She leans over to lay a kiss on her sleeping son’s forehead as an apology.</p>
<p>“Mom will give you something in exchange tomorrow…”</p>
<p>Then, what calm semblance remained when she asked her son was gone as she tore through the package of the pudding, like a ravenous beast. The small spoon companion to the treat lays unforgotten. With a dip of her head, she takes a little bite out of the gelatinous snack.</p>
<p><em>Oh my god! Delicious!</em></p>
<p>“Oh my…”</p>
<p>Her slender neck arches in ecstasy, her delicate, small face glowing despite the dim lighting. With her eyes closed, a soft groan came from her lips—her satisfaction evident as the pudding melted in her tongue. She eats one mouthful after another, only the faint light and some reflectors beaming at her in the darkness, but her eyes still became lighter, filled to the brim with inexplicable joy!</p>
<p>As if she was eating a meal from the highest Michelin star restaurant!</p>
<p>Through the monitor, every expression and movement conveyed was captured, making Director Guo Mingxu squeeze the arm of his chair in excitement.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s it, that’s it…”</p>
<p>And Li Tao, who was standing behind the monitor, initially donning an impassive look was awestruck—as if he had been struck by thunder! She really loves his pudding, <em>very</em> much! He steals a glance at Shen Yichong with his ever-present silent persona, yet he could notice the broody man’s careful stares directed at his wife.</p>
<p>With a strange voice, he voices his inquiry, “Sister-in-law is she…”</p>
<p><em>Did she suffer from abuse? Has she ever eaten a decent meal in her life?</em></p>
<p>But before he could finish his question, the monitor brings his attention back, just in time for him to see Yu Yaoyao full of hesitation, but still adamant on reaching for the second pudding. Her fingers like quick, little talons, the speed of her hand’s descent, was enough to render him stunned!</p>
<p>The second time, she swallows the whole pudding into her mouth all at once, her cheeks swelling like hamsters at her gluttony</p>
<p>“Munch, munch, munch…”</p>
<p>The suspect watches the child warily, gulping the treats quickly, for fear he would suddenly wake up</p>
<p>Li Tao was beyond astonished! As the primary decision-maker for the pudding brand, he was quite bewildered. Is this truly his pudding? Are they sure it’s not some nectar from the heavens? Are his desserts that scrumptious? How could he not know! How!?</p>
<p>Li Tao swallows some saliva to parch his dry throat, taking a closer look at the discarded wrapper on the ground. The torn packages that lay bear the text ‘banana flavor’.</p>
<p><em>Was this flavor… immensely improved without my knowledge?</em></p>
<p>All of a sudden, his palate was watering—he had the urge to try as well. Li Tao was locked in a trance.</p>
<p>Despite the camera on her face, Yu Yaoyao just couldn’t stop, the expressions on her face turning more crazed by the moment as if she was a lunatic for food! Every flavor was delightful—she couldn’t stop eating all!</p>
<p>But when she finally reached the end of the tray, her face morphs that into shock. She bows her head, a regretful sigh coming from the depths of her soul.</p>
<p>After she feasts… the pudding is gone. She has eaten it all up.</p>
<p>Her pink tongue traced her lips for any remnant taste of the devoured pudding, giving a pathetic look towards the camera. She glances at the sleeping child again, a second decision having formed in her mind. With a carefully stretched arm, the empty snack box was slowly pushed under the child’s bed.</p>
<p>As if her glut a few moments ago hadn’t happened!</p>
<p>“Cut!” Guo Mingxu exclaimed, almost jumping from his chair.</p>
<p>Upon hearing his prompt, Yu Yaoyao immediately leaps from the floor with her bare feet, her exhilaration barely concealed.</p>
<p>“Director, NG<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>!? Do you want me to start from the beginning and eat it again? Perhaps this time, I can act that the banana-flavored pudding tastes three times better than its milk and strawberry counterparts! Does that sound good?!”</p>
<p>Guo Mingxu gawked, the entire production team turning silent behind him.</p>
<p><em>NG? Eat it again?</em></p>
<p>“There’s no need… you acted on point. Expressions were natural, not looking exaggerated. Upon closer inspection, it looks like you were purely enjoying the meal and not acting at all.”</p>
<p>Guo Mingxu shook his head quickly, firing his praises as quick as a machine gun. His good mood was present on his bright face.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for retakes! It’s already perfect as it is.”</p>
<p>Li Tao also nods, his admiration for her first take palpable on his face. He heartily agrees with the director. He was currently holding a banana pudding in his hand, which he had sneakily snatched from the marketing manager nearby.</p>
<p>He surmises men who aren’t privy to sweet snacks would really be tempted to try upon seeing her acting. She cherished the pudding as if it were some gem. As if she was stuck on an island, and it was her only remaining source of nourishment… making one tempted enough to try!</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Yet when Yu Yaoyao was given acclaim, she didn’t rejoice one bit, a cloud of disappointment and regret settling on her face like dark clouds.</p>
<p>“How can it be perfect?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who was nearby, wasn’t quick enough to stop her.</p>
<p>She had already moped in front of the director. “Director, I still have a hundred different ways to eat the snacks… don’t you want to see it?”</p>
<p>Guo Mingxu freezes for a moment, “A hundred…?” a big looming question mark on his face.</p>
