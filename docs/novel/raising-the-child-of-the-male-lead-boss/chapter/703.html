            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 48 – A Brewing Storm</strong></p>
<p>Meng Xinran was next to them eavesdropping. When the assistant handed her a towel, she wanted to cry immediately!</p>
<p>In order to get a spot in this program, she almost fought with other actors and had to beg numerous directors of different statuses just to snatch a place in it! Li Bo should have been initially the director to grant her a ticket, but with her recent poor performance in the set, he didn’t give it to her.</p>
<p>Thus, she was ultimately forced to resort to other means—ordering her agent to secure a ticket from another director!</p>
<p>However, she didn’t expect that Yu Yaoyao would get Li Bo’s entry ticket so easily!</p>
<p><em>It’s supposed to be mine!</em> she could only think grievously.</p>
<p><em>And what of her becoming a diamond? </em></p>
<p>This old woman merely depends on her big shot husband, with everything at the tip of her finger. How could she so shamelessly declare she was gold about to become a dazzling diamond in the future?</p>
<p>But the real question was, how could she fail acting five years ago and make a shocking comeback this time?</p>
<p>Meng Xinran gritted her teeth until they hurt.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt her intense malice, but she was too lazy to deal with her, lest even look at her. Although there are many enemies in the wild, it all depends on her mood who she wants to eat or not.</p>
<p>Just looking at this girl’s hideous face, Yu Yaoyao couldn’t help but snort, <em>What a pitiful and hideous opponent. Too undeserving of my time!</em></p>
<p>She turned to Ni Yi instead and said, “Little Yi, let’s go home. Also, pack the little snakes for my baby to see.”</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao acted her parts and ate her last bento at the set, she said her formal farewells and left.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, I hope we can work together again next time!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations on filming all your scenes! May it be successful once it is aired!”</p>
<p>“Rise all the way!”</p>
<p>“Next time, we will give you an extra chicken leg during meal time.”</p>
<p>As soon as she left, everyone also uttered their cordial goodbyes to her. Their warm words were completely different from the past mockery and unfriendliness she received from them just a few days ago.</p>
<p>Originally, everyone on set thought she was only a spoiled, rich wife who was extremely hard to get along with.</p>
<p>But during filming in the past few days, not only did they find out that she was actually adept at acting, she was also beautiful and very approachable. She liked to hang out with anyone, without derision, and ate together with them during breaks. She was a funny conversationalist, and everyone soon slowly found themselves getting close to her.</p>
<p>They were even a little reluctant to see her leave the set.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran saw all these changes happen before her eyes. And her eyes could only burn in fury and jealousness. But still in the end, she went to Yu Yaoyao to bid her goodbyes as well.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, the next time we meet please teach this amateur actress more.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes were slanted as she smirked, “Oh, sure.”</p>
<p>Why should she fight with this girl? She’s all bark and no bite!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>In a villa someplace in the rich suburbs, a black-haired man was leisurely lying on the sofa, with his long legs crossed above another as he leaned on the sofa’s armrest, his fingers flipping through the pages casually of a book he was currently buried in.</p>
<p>Even with this languid pose, it did not lessen his undeniable appeal.</p>
<p>Soon after, a woman dressed in red came inside, disrupting the man’s reading time.</p>
<p>She smiled, “I have actually found out that Yu Yaoyao’s love letter was truly written to you. On that day, your assistant told me that she was wandering outside the door of your room with an envelope in hand, but then ran away after being discovered.”</p>
<p>Her lips narrowed to a contemptuous smirk, “Are we going to pay that little assistant to send proof on Weibo for another scandalous hot search?”</p>
<p>The man’s slender fingers pulled the book down a little, revealing a pair of peach blossom, phoenix eyes.</p>
<p>“No,” he simply said.</p>
<p>“But we want to get out of Guangxin entertainment without a taint to your name,” answered the woman in red. “I believe this is a good opportunity.”</p>
