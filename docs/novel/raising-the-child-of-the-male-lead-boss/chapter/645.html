            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 106 – P Stands for Pudding and Pine</strong></p>
<p>Meng Xinran realized what she had said was a big mistake far too late; the people who had heard were now subtly looking at her with an astonished look.</p>
<p><em>Turning the sheets over, looking at the garbage can…at this point, this kind of method is like looking for evidence that s*x has happened. This pure girl countenance is a fake all along; this Meng Xinran is so familiar with this routine!</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran stared at Yu Yaoyao with blatant resentment. The words she had uttered can not be taken back anymore! If downfall is imminent for her, she is going to make Yu Yaoyao her cushion!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at Meng Xinran’s hateful eyes, eyes that look as if they wanted to devour her. Her lips pulled to a small smile as she took a tissue from the table and tried to make it as a makeshift glove around her elegant, smooth fingers. She then looked towards the trashcan with a look of sadness.</p>
<p>“Ah,” she dragged out the garbage can from below and flashed a smile at Meng Xinran. “I’m taking it out for everyone.”</p>
<p>As soon as it was dragged out, everyone could now see it. It was evident Yu Yaoyao rarely used her towels, as the can was empty. Instead, only two empty pudding cases and a plastic bag with instant noodles were inside it.</p>
<p>“There is also garbage can inside the bathroom. Do you want to see that too?” Yu Yaoyao said and covered her nose, looking at her with lament. “But I can’t help you with that anymore; it’s too dirty. If you want to see it, do it by yourself.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran felt she was going to collapse! But how can she still flinch when she has gone this far? She needed the bystanders to see Yu Yaoyao’s real colors.</p>
<p>She can’t retreat!</p>
<p>Therefore when Yu Yaoyao refused to offer a hand, she rushed into the restroom herself with renewed vigor.</p>
<p>“I am not doing this selfishly. I am doing this for the reputation of the entire program!” Meng Xinran announced to everyone.</p>
<p>But they all remained silent. Thinking, <em>Isn’t Meng Xinran too active?</em></p>
<p>When Meng Xinran entered the bathroom and decided to search the garbage, she truly felt humiliated as she dug through the trash, taking out all the dirty tissues inside. Ultimately, only to find an empty pudding case at the bottom.</p>
<p><em>Another pudding!</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s whole body became unstable, swaying. She felt as if everything had turned black in front of her!</p>
<p>“Sorry, I forgot to tell you. I threw another pudding case beside the tissues I used to wipe my hands with, haha. But if you like searching through garbage so much, you can come back tomorrow and help me throw them away.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao couldn’t help but smile as Meng Xinran fixed her with a grim look.</p>
<p><em>No, something is not right! I refuse to believe she can settle this so quickly!</em></p>
<p>“Sister, don’t deny it anymore. Are you not smitten with the Shen boss? A rumor floating around Guangxin entertainment is that you have fallen out of love with the boss…”</p>
<p>However, while was everyone listening to Meng Xinran, whose behavior and speech were becoming extremely abnormal as time passed, a man’s cold and hard voice cut through the tense air inside the room.</p>
<p>“Oh? Then why haven’t I heard of this?”</p>
<p>The whole audience instantly felt dumbfounded. <em>It’s a man’s voice! </em>But it came from Yu Yaoyao tablet placed on the table.</p>
<p>“Husband!” Yu Yaoyao picked up the tablet and cried coyly. She also turned the screen to show Meng Xinran, standing inside the room. “This little flower is bullying me again, huhu.”</p>
<p>As soon as she faced the screen towards them, everyone saw a dashing, handsome man.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked; she was on a video call all along! And what more, a video call with her husband, the Guangxin boss, where a group of people stormed a married woman’s room! Their actions were too crazy!</p>
<p>No, instead, they were taken to a ditch thanks to Meng Xinran!</p>
<p>When the newcomers realized that they had barged into the room of Yu Yaoyao, who was in a video call with the Guangxin boss, they immediately turned pale. After all, Guangxin is a famed entertainment company in the industry, having created a wave of superstars in the past three years and is the company most of these newcomers wanted to apply. The deputy director was none the better; he was black-faced for acquiescing in Meng Xinran to search the room. How could he explain that to the Shen boss?</p>
<p>Now, everyone was glaring at Meng Xinran as they tried to slip away from a very disadvantageous situation.</p>
<p>But suddenly, the cold voice sounded from directly behind them!</p>
<p>“Who allowed you to stay inside your room to hide and eat so much pudding?”</p>
