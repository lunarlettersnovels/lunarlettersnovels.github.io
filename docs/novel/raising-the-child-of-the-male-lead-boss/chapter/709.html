            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 42 – Be More Independent</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao did not force him and smiled. After all, back when she was a snake, she also hid a lot of little secrets from the zookeeper.</p>
<p>Before long, she tilted in the back seat, fidgeting with her cell phone as she sat like melted goo. It also seems that the steamed bun has made peace with the snake and did not have any lingering fears anymore. Instead, he stared at them with interest and took pictures of them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yu Yaoyao was watching a new Korean drama while her son was preoccupied; there are a lot of dramas in this world that she hasn’t seen before.</p>
<p>Both mother and son were contented.</p>
<p>When the car reached their home, Ni Yi opened the door and Shen Yichong looked towards the backseat.</p>
<p>He saw his son soundly sleeping, with Yu Yaoyao’s one arm wrapped around his little body, his small head happily rested on Yu Yaoyao’s chest as if it was the most comfortable pillow in the world.</p>
<p>And Yu Yaoyao who was drooling with a face of lovestruck fool as her eyes were fixated on the screen. Furthermore, she had a strange, creepy smile like an old aunt.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glowered, “Take your cage away, and if you want to raise them, have someone install a glass cabinet. You are not allowed to let it out, nor are you allowed to take it inside the rooms on the second floor.”</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao had no reaction and he therefore directly took the small steamed bun from her arms.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong did not turn his sight back, as if a fearsome, ugly beast lived at the backseat and he was eager to run away. He hugged his son and walked quickly into the courtyard towards the doorstep.</p>
<p>“Really? So hard on snakes.” Yu Yaoyao shrugged her shoulders and said to Ni Yi, “All right. Ni Yi, you take it in for me. Okay, we’ll change the cage. Put the first one on the living room for the baby to play, and then for his father as an office pet when he is tired.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s legs were shaking as he cried, “Sister, have you been overstimulated lately?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao casually waved her hand and walked in front of him to catch up with the two men who had already gone in.</p>
<p>The first thing she did when she got home was to take a hot bath, change into her baggy pajamas and immediately fall back in bed, sleep taking her.</p>
<p>And the little steamed bun had fallen asleep in the car, but his hungry stomach that hadn’t eaten dinner soon woke him up.</p>
<p>The moment he woke up, he was acutely aware that the comfortable pillow his little head had reclined on, has changed! There is no fragrance from his mommy’s body, nor the soft feeling he felt laying on mommy’s body.</p>
<p>He frowned and opened his eyes, and sure enough, he only saw his little bed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was by his side accompanying him, “Awake?”</p>
<p>He watched the steamed bun wake up with a grumpy face and could not help but raise his eyebrows. To Shen Yichong’s quizzical surprise, the small steamed bun, with his little hand, silently pushed his pillow away, his face showing his refusal.</p>
<p><em>Mommy’s embrace is better!</em></p>
<p>He looked up at his father and remembered what his mother had said before.</p>
<p>Sure enough, his dad is jealous of him!</p>
<p>It was clear before that he had slept well within the confines of his mommy’s arms, but now he’s back in his little room. It must be his daddy who carried him away.</p>
<p>The small steamed bun suddenly puffed out his cheeks bitterly, and his small eyes filled with complaints kept drifting toward Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Dad, aren’t you in your thirties this year?”</p>
