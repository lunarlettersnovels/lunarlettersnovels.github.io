            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 50 – Gifts for the Family</strong></p>
<p>This is the first time she has made money on her own!</p>
<p>The 50,000 was only a small amount compared with the pocket money the original owner received, rather, swindled from Shen Yichong. It wasn’t even enough to afford a luxurious, limited edition bag, but Yu Yaoyao can’t help but be pleased at this achievement!</p>
<p>“Oh, we are going to shop till we drop! Today we’re going to try how it feels to be a nouveau riche<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wearing dark sunglasses and an inconspicuous mask over her face, excitedly rushed inside the department store.</p>
<p>And then she went towards the section where all the stuffed toys were and took all the plump and cute plush toy snakes.</p>
<p>She brought every single one.</p>
<p>Afterward, when she was window shopping, she also went inside a variety of chocolate shops, candy stores, ice cream shops and even the supermarket to buy a handful of snacks.</p>
<p>She never had these kinds of things at the zoo.</p>
<p>Ni Yi fretfully followed after her and helped her with the big bags and even argues to carry the small ones. In the end, the two people came home arms full of shopping bags.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong got home in the evening, he found that Ni Yi had not yet left, and his fat face was looking around nervously in the living room.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, was slouching over the table with a pained expression on her face.</p>
<p>Lastly, his son, the steamed bun Shen Rui was in front of his mother. The little fellow was obediently eating, and while eating, the corners of his mouth would rise once in a while as he looked at the huge, white snake toy plushie he was holding in his hands.</p>
<p>When he took another bite, he would bow his head and caress the head with his small hand, as if it was a very precious thing.</p>
<p>“Boss,” acknowledged Ni Yi as he wiped his sweat.</p>
<p>“Dad,” the steamed bun broke into a dazzling smile as he lifted the head of the snake plushie he had draped on his shoulder, gleefully showing it to Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao only shook her hand listlessly towards his direction.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Shen Yichong’s eyebrows rose questioningly. “Where’s dinner?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao remembered how delicious the meal was yesterday and as soon as she heard Shen Yichong’s inquiry, she cried aggrievedly on the spot.</p>
<p>Ni Yi is even more at a loss.</p>
<p>The steamed bun quickly raised his small hand to answer, “Dad, mommy’s TV show is over! To celebrate this victory she bought a lot of snacks back, but Uncle Ni Yi said she received a new project. So! In order to look good on TV, she cannot eat these, but only look at it.”</p>
<p>“But! Mommy couldn’t help it and took a bag of potato chips. She hid and ate everything, but then Uncle Ni Yi found out and said she couldn’t eat dinner tonight, or else she’d be fat.”</p>
<p>“And then, mommy cried.” As the steamed bun dutifully recited what happened, he took a sympathetic glance at his mother and lowered his voice to whisper to his dad. “I secretly ate a mouthful of vegetables just for mommy.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, held her stomach as she sobbed and looked at Shen Yichong, pulling on the sleeves of his clothes like a madman.</p>
<p>“If one day I suddenly die, you must also starve to death. But before that, remember to cook delicious meals for me who is in the afterlife. Three servings for everything!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned on the spot and only frowned. “What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m so miserable! I haven’t even eaten these; I’ve never eaten anything like this in my whole life and you’re still yelling at me! “</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao directly pulled out the white handkerchief peeking out from his suit pants and used it to wipe her tears.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, but he did not stop her from taking it.</p>
<p>An onlooker to the said, assistant Chen Lin, had his mouth wide open seeing this exchange, and he looked at his boss’ face in surprise.</p>
<p><em>The boss doesn’t actually mind? </em></p>
<p>What is this development!</p>
<p>“I-I also bought you a present.” Yu Yaoyao continued. After she wiped her tears, she took the shopping bag placed on the seat next to her and gave it to Shen Yichong who only stood unresponsively.</p>
<p>“Well, what are you waiting for? Take it. There’s no need to thank me.”</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong’s fingers were tense as he accepted the shopping bag. He has another <em>gift</em>?</p>
<p>“Is it a snake again?” His eyebrows met at the middle. But when he opened the bag to take the item inside, his face became little dark.</p>
<p>This gift was none other than a green dinosaur onesie with a tail attached on its ass paired with a green horn hat.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Shen Yichong took a deep, careful breath.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao is sitting soullessly on the two-legged chair. She had wanted to buy a snake onesie, but there wasn’t anything like it in the department store—only a dinosaur edition.</p>
<p>The steamed bun raised his small hand again and said, “Mom and dad’s costume are of the same style—big dinosaurs. I am a baby dragon!”</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, his eyes eagerly looked at Shen Yichong, “Dad, quickly give mama Xu your costume! Let her wash it and have it dry so we can wear all our costumes after taking a bath!”</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth only twitched.</p>
