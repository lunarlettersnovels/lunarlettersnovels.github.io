            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 154 – The CEO’s Real Status at Home</strong></p>
<p>“Dad, I forgot to bring my big white snake with me, so I came back to take it.” Little Bun reasoned with his father, after flattering his mother.</p>
<p>He glanced at him and found him coldly staring at him. So, he carefully raised the favorite plushie he was holding. He had anticipated it and already got earlier on, just to show it to his father as if it was evidence needed to prove his innocence.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was massaging his temples, looked at the Chen Lin standing next to him.</p>
<p>“Director, this scene…” Shen Yichong turned to Zhao Yu.</p>
<p>“Dad, I didn’t show my face.” Shen Rui protruded his head and immediately covered half of his face with the big white snake toy he was holding.</p>
<p>“No one can recognize me, so it doesn’t matter.” He looked at Yu Yaoyao eagerly and then pitifully at the uncles, who were filming his parents.</p>
<p>“Uncle, you didn’t film me, right?”</p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu’s heart stirred at the cute and puerile query of the little bun. He immediately turned to the man of the house and reassured that his son wouldn’t be included in the filming.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, you can review the episode later.” After that, he turned to the cameramen filming inside the living room. “Don’t completely focus on the child during the couple’s scenes, but you can still record every movement of the child alone.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s thin lips twitched as Director Zhao Yu turned back to him with a new found confidence. “Later, when your child is older, the videos can be your memorabilia.”</p>
<p>Cameraman Lao Zheng, who had been recording silently, couldn’t help but follow the orders of the director.</p>
<p>“The child’s profiles or backs can still be included in the filming.” He added. “Also, the voice of your child can be processed later on.” Even though little bun was still young, he was able to understand what the director meant, his eyes shone bright like a diamond looking gratefully at his uncle who’d thoughtfully stood up for him.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao was of the opinion that the beauty of her son should be witnessed by the world.</p>
<p>“The artifacts on the sea can be hidden for a while, but not for a lifetime.” She expressly stated. “Since beauty was discovered, it would be best to show it to everyone sooner!”</p>
<p>Little Bun immediately looked at his mother with admiration and nodded in approval. Shen Yichong blankly glanced at Chen Lin standing beside him.</p>
<p>The softhearted Chen Lin, who’d agreed to uphold Little Bun’s sentiments, soon realized that he was tricked and everything was planned from the very beginning. He now looked inexplicably sullen.</p>
<p>“Sit down.” Shen Yichong seemed to be finally convinced. “Sit with your Mommy.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui’s eyes lit up immediately. He skipped to his mother cheerfully, and sat closely beside her. His hands lay flat on his legs and his cute little face looked ever so disciplined and docile.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong sighed deeply, and looked at the five year old mastermind behind what was being dealt with now. “Be obedient in the future.” He wanted his son to know his little mischief had not gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>“Don’t make rash decisions.” He further added.</p>
<p>The mother and son nodded in unison and sat on the sofa primp and proper.</p>
<p>From what he saw, Director Zhao Yu, thought that the mother and son obediently followed his orders as if he, himself, was the law.</p>
<p>The cameraman recorded that scene and deliberately filmed Shen Yichong’s stern training to his wife from various angles making sure that only the back and side view of the little bun was taken.</p>
<p>However, in less than a minute, their obedience suddenly disappeared. When his father finished preaching, the little bun immediately stood up on top of the sofa and put all the cushions behind Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Mommy, lie down.” He patted the mat and flattened it out.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately hugged him and kissed him on his tender cheeks, “Thank you baby,” she said sweetly and the little bun blushed shyly; his face was as red as an Elmo doll.</p>
<p>He then dragged his father’s arm.</p>
<p>“Dad, sit down a bit, put your hand around Mommy’s neck.” Little Bun cutely instructed his father. “Otherwise her head will feel sore…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao instantly raised her head giving ample space for her husband’s muscular jade arm to reach her. “Husband, as you can see I am lying like this. Raise your arm higher so that I can see the TV~”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was astounded, and at the same time, all the staff lowered their head and sweetly smiled at the scene they just witnessed.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen’s status at home had plummeted to the very bottom!</p>
