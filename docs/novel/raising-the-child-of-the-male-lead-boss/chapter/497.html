            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 266 – Memories of the Enclosure (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>The words of the staff certainly cast a shadow over the amusement that everybody had been enjoying. There was suspense and worry regarding the next level. Soon, the camera turned to a box shrouded by a black cloth. The staff peeled the cloth in one corner to reveal a rush of insects crawling inside.</p>
<p>The viewers couldn’t hold their concerns to themselves and turned to expressing them in the comments:</p>
<p><strong>【OMG! I am having goosebumps! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Even if Yaoyao said she wasn’t afraid of insects, I think she meant one or two of them. The number of insects is just too scary! 】</strong></p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, let’s head to the next spot,” said Director Zhao, “If she passes this level, she would need to find you in person in the next one.” He gave Shen Yichong a worried smile. “It’s alright if she skips this level, you know,” he said, “we could just add a bit of difficulty in the next one if this is too scary.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned. “I want to watch her finish this level before leaving,” he said. Director Zhao shook his head in disapproval. But Shen Yichong continued, “There is another mini-game of removing stones from the water bottle, isn’t there? That will take at least ten minutes. Just let me watch this one. I want to make sure your staff doesn’t sabotage the level while I leave.”</p>
<p>His face was solemn. He hoped the insects wouldn’t harm Yu Yaoyao or scare Little Bun. His forehead was etched with worry and he looked so serious that nobody dared to refuse him. Director Zhao considered it and conveyed it to a staff. He looked at Shen Yichong and nodded unwillingly.</p>
<p>“Okay,” Director Zhao conceded, “But you have to promise me you won’t do anything to reveal your location later. And regardless of whether she plays or deserts this level, you will come with us the moment the next one begins.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded. “I promise,” he said. Director Zhao had no choice but to agree with Shen Yichong, so he sat down to watch with him. Director Zhao, Shen Yichong, the cameraman and two other staff were in a room with a small door that led out of the insect museum with nobody seeing them. It was a blind corner that they had chosen in the area so that Yu Yaoyao wouldn’t spot them when they left.</p>
<p>It was already six o’clock in the evening. It was almost time for the insect museum to close. The hall was so quiet that even a pin dropping would have sounded like a cacophony. The tension and the excitement were palpable in the atmosphere. The viewers watched, holding their breath in all seriousness. At this moment, Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui, with the cameraman in toe, reached the place. She looked around and walked cautiously, looking very solemn. Little Bun soon noticed the change in his mom’s mood and clasped her hand.</p>
<p>“Mommy, are you afraid?” he asked, nervously.</p>
<p>Many insects in the museum naturally lived in a dark and humid environment. With the closure of the museum, the lights in the corridor had been turned off. There was only the dim, yellow lights emanating from the insect boxes. The place looked large and loomed ahead. Many people would have found it very disquieting to enter such a place.</p>
<p>“Mommy,” said Little Bun, “Can you pick me up?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was surprised. She had spaced out, and only now became aware of the gloomy atmosphere and a nervous Shen Rui. She leaned down and picked him up in her arms. The atmosphere here was dark, damp and silent. It was what she had loved once. But the glass cases with the insects chilled her to the bones. It reminded her of her nightmares, which she could never escape. She decided she hated this place most ardently. Little Bun’s hands, wrapped around his mum’s shoulder, tightened. He was trying to comfort his mother, sensing her discomfort.</p>
<p>“It’s alright, mommy,” he said, “We’ll be out in a second. Dad used to bring me to places like these when I was younger. You will see, this isn’t scary at all.” He was patting her on the back, trying to instill confidence. His effort warmed Yu Yaoyao’s heart, and she found a support in this small child in her arms.</p>
<p>“You are right,” said Yu Yaoyao, “Thank you, baby.” She mustered a warm smile to put him at ease.</p>
<p>A staff member stepped forward and pulled out a task card. “There are three minor levels in this place. You need to complete at least two to successfully pass and proceed to the next location,” he declared, “First, you need to get the key from the box. Second, you need to get the stones from a water bottle. Third, sort the insects within one minute. When you have passed at least two of these, you will find your husband waiting for you at the next level.”</p>
