            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 98 – Malicious Woman</strong></p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s joy was above the roof when she heard this, “Diamond man? Is he also a boss from a wealthy family? Sister, does he have more money than your husband?”</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao merely held her hands above her chest. When she saw the camera held by photographer Zheng, she smiled with a face full of affection and declared, “I love you, my <em>dear</em> husband.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran was taken aback, confused. She looked down at her mobile phone and saw a new message reflected on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>[Shen Yichong V: This photo is defamation and has caused damage to my wife’s reputation; a lawyer has been hired to investigate this, and the culprit shall take legal responsibility. Over the past five years, my wife has raised our child and devoted a lot of time to her family; she has never strayed away from home. Please stop spreading rumors! To Yu Yaoyao, compete with all your strength and don’t be persuaded by anyone trying to bring you down.]</strong></p>
<p>It was posted on Weibo, where a lawyer’s letter was directly attached below it.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s heart thumped. <em>The photo sent to me was just a fake?!</em></p>
<p>Soon after, there was a tweet posted by Yu Yaoyao herself!</p>
<p><strong>[Yu Yaoyao V: I love you, honey! Even the water I am drinking every day reminds me of my love for you.] </strong>Included with this tweet was a selfie where she held a water bottle in her hands, with the water coincidentally at the 520<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup> mL mark.</p>
<p>In an instant, the post was bombarded with frenzied netizens.</p>
<p><strong>[520?! You can also be naughty as this even when drinking water? Impressive!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Ahh! The next time this single dog buys a water bottle, he will look at the capacity label first!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Oh my God, isn’t this a bit too romantic?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I was wrong about the goddess again; my fault!]</strong></p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s absentminded gaze glazed over the comments. <em>So…this is the end of it? This Yu Yaoyao, is she an immortal Jack Bauer?</em></p>
<p>“Oh, my fans have risen again.” Yu Yaoyao’s brisk laughter rang out shortly. “I am thankful for these people who buy me a spot in the hot searches every day. It makes me feel warm. Ah~ look at that; fans are rising in hundreds and thousands!”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran could only clench her teeth until they hurt, her eyes bloodshot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>When evening came, the staff of the “In the Limelight” organized a farewell party for the eliminated contestants. All those occupying the top spots, including Yu Yaoyao, especially had their cameraman follow them all the way. Whereas, in classes below them, several people share a single cameraman.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to grab a spot in the video, many people fought for a chance to drink with their eliminated sisters and brothers and to bid them goodbye with tears and laughter.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao wasn’t interested in mingling with people she barely knew. Instead, she took advantage of the absence of the mob of cameras and secretly hid in an inconspicuous corner to slowly enjoy her delicious little pudding in secret.</p>
<p>But Photographer Zheng was diligent on following her and unbeknownst to her–he had filmed her eating the pudding behind everyone’s back as her cheeks puffed out like a hamster.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao saw him, she immediately hissed at him. “You can’t tell anyone, brother Zheng.”</p>
<p>Lao Zheng didn’t even know what to say!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s pretty face was conflicted, but after a while, she opened her handbag and took out a milk candy. “All right…here you go,” she uttered with a troubled face as if she had just given a big treasure.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell on me; my agent won’t let me eat snacks. I will try my best to exercise tonight.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao bared her teeth and raised her fist, glancing at the camera, “I have never been fat, and won’t be.”</p>
<p><em>Who has seen a fat snake? No, no, no, such a creature doesn’t exist!</em></p>
<p>Lao Zheng, who was carrying the camera, reluctantly accepted the candy.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao enjoyed the pudding with cheerfulness and took a sip of wine. However, as soon as the liquid entered her mouth, her pink tongue instantly felt tingly with the bizarre flavor. She immediately spat it all out on a towel and never touched the glass again for the duration of the night.</p>
<p>After a few gulps of Zhao Xiaomeng’s juice, Yu Yaoyao felt a little sleepy. At nine o’clock, when the night would fall, the zoo would close; this was her previous bedtime hour.</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes, stood up, and said, “Eldest brother Zheng, I’m going to sleep now. Please tell everyone I’ll be seeing them tomorrow.” Yu Yaoyao waved to the camera and left the restaurant.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao passed by a few female artists gathered together, Meng Xinran, who was sitting in the table with said artists ranked in position C, caught sight of her.</p>
<p>Mouth pursed in silent anger, she mumbled, “I’m going to go to the bathroom. I’ll be right back,” and left the table, closely following after Yu Yaoyao.</p>
