            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 220 – A Cunning Husband (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose<br>
Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Ni Yi was stumped; he had never expected Yu Yaoyao to do something so audacious, even in his wildest dreams.</p>
<p>Apparently, she had either forgotten or chosen to ignore the part about her bringing good fortune to her husband or even the part about her having a husband altogether, and instead was brazenly cozying up to so many people on Weibo.</p>
<p><em>Was she not afraid of rejection and losing face?</em></p>
<p>Ni Yi was bewildered by her strange and immoral behavior and his eyes automatically searched for Shen Yichong. ‘But Boss is such a successful man’ was the first thought that his brain registered.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu didn’t seem perturbed by the humiliation she often faced during her attempts and instead tried even harder to establish new connections in the hope that they would help advance boss’s career.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when he had no money, she ate just rice and let her husband and child eat meat in her stead. How touching!</p>
<p>Just thinking about it made Ni Yi sigh. He couldn’t fathom why, but he felt certain that fortune favored the foolish.</p>
<p>It had only been a short while, but so many people had responded to her invitations already.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng was one of the few artists on The Stage, who did not belong to an entertainment company. It was primarily because she was indecisive about whether she really wanted to go into the entertainment business.</p>
<p>On The Stage, Yu Yaoyao had stood up for her once, on the very first day, when she had been extremely nervous and was on the verge of bursting into tears. However, she had discovered her confidence and had come a long way since then. Today, she was one of the top ten finalists and was going to find herself an agency, soon.</p>
<p><em>If now Yu Yaoyao were to ask her, Zhao Xiaomeng would surely agree. And even Qiu Dajian would join Guangxin as well.</em></p>
<p>Ni Yi was speechless. He had heard earlier that Qiu Dajian was having problems with his agency, but he hadn’t expected to hear that, he would join Guangxin so soon.</p>
<p>And what was up with….Screenwriter Liu and Director Zhou?!</p>
<p>Ni Yi couldn’t believe his eyes. He rubbed them for a full minute before he read the posts on Weibo over and over again.</p>
<p>A little while later, he found himself looking for Yu Yaoyao and once again rubbed his eyes in disbelief, when he discovered her blocking Director Zhao’s way on the balcony.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It so conspired that Shen Yichong chose exactly that same moment to go look for his wife, whom he hadn’t seen since morning but was being actively mentioned on Weibo. He decided to search for her on the balcony, first, and found her right there, blocking Director Zhao’s path; trying to persuade him.</p>
<p>“Director Zhao, are you really not considering this? Look at me, I am really lucky, and I don’t bring good fortune just to  myself, but also to my husband; if you come work with my husband, you’ll definitely receive a lot of good fortune too..”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who had overheard his wife, could not hold himself back. Agitated and amused, he took two steps forward, and pulled Yu Yaoyao towards him, her back landing against his chest.</p>
<p>“Director Zhao, my wife is giving you trouble, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>He turned to look at Director Zhao, once he had ensured that Yu Yaoyao stood in the corner, shielded from the cold winds.</p>
<p>He held her hand and on finding it freezing cold, enclosed both of hers in his.</p>
<p>“She specially mentioned you on Weibo……saying she brings good luck to her husband……”As Zhao Yu spoke, his eyes twinkled and his mouth widened into a warm smile.</p>
<p>It was evident that Shen Yichong was ecstatic to hear that; his usually emotionless face couldn’t help but betray his joy.</p>
<p>“Please don’t mind those invitations.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu’s mouth twitched at this response.</p>
<p>This smile of his was way bigger and far more genuine than any of the ones he ever gave before the camera.</p>
<p>“Great, then everything’s fine.”</p>
<p>As a director, Zhao Yu did not expose the details of his personal life, therefore not much was known about him and he remained secure from the keyboard warriors’ and netizens’ harsh trolling and vigilance. He thus, did not hesitate to speak his mind.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, meanwhile was deeply hurt  and stared at Shen Yichong unhappily.</p>
<p>“How did I make trouble? Do I annoy you?” Just the thought pained her as if there were a thousand needles stabbing her heart.</p>
<p><em>He thought she was annoying!?</em></p>
<p>“How am I annoying? Am I annoying? Do you think I’m annoying?”</p>
<p>She mumbled ,and was suddenly reminded of the situations in TV shows, which she’d often found melodramatic, wherein the heroines always wept like they were going to starve to death when the heroes were upset with them. Yet, just then, she not only understood their sentiment but also empathized with them.</p>
<p>She sniffed as her eyes hazed with a mist of hurt. Feeling helpless and ashamed, she cried, “Then I’ll leave you alone.”</p>
<p>As she turned around to leave, a strong arm encircled her waist tightly, holding her in place and a deep voice declared, “I don’t think you’re annoying.”</p>
<p>“You do! You just said so, that I’m annoying! You said, I gave trouble to Director Zh……mm….”</p>
<p>Her complaints were muffled by Shen Yichong’s kiss. However, to his surprise Yu Yaoyao resisted and pushed him away.</p>
<p>He caught her hands, and pinning her against the French windows, leaned down to give her another kiss.</p>
<p>“You’re not annoying.” He said; his voice hoarse with longing.</p>
<p>He kissed her sweet and soft little mouth again and again, as if he would never tire of it.</p>
<p>“You can never annoy me.” He repeated.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted and huffed.</p>
<p>Director Zhao tried to say something but stopped; no one was listening to him anyway.</p>
<p>Watching this passionate public display of affection, he was stumped for a moment. Fortunately, he regained  his senses immediately, and gestured frantically to the cameramen.</p>
<p>Shoot! Shoot everything!</p>
<p>This would be a befitting slap on the faces of all the trolls who questioned the authenticity of their relationship on the internet.</p>
