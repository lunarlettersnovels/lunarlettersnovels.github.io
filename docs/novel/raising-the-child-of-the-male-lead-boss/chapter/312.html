            <p><strong>Chapter 451</strong></p>
<p>After this issue of ‘Welcome to My Home’ was broadcast, it also attracted the attention of most netizens. Those who did not have time to watch the live broadcast also saw the edited feature film.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s absence from the show was also a great regret for many of the YY fans. Some extreme viewers on the Internet even thought that this program was a malicious scam. Those advertising sponsors were also mainly aiming for Yu Yaoyao’s popularity at the time. But due to her pregnancy, she was absent for at least half a year, and she might not even appear on the screen for a period of time.</p>
<p>This made the advertising sponsors who have paid a lot of money a little upset! It was like they were spending money to buy ‘a’, but they ended up getting ‘b’ and ‘c’. They wished they could curse or even have their money refunded.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes before the show was broadcasted, Zhao Yu was notified by his assistant that many partners were dissatisfied. There were even calls for inquiries.</p>
<p>“Will Yu Yaoyao participate in the next episode?”</p>
<p>“Can you guarantee she would appear for at least half an hour for each episode?”</p>
<p>Nowadays, the total duration of variety shows was generally about two hours. Appearing for half an hour was equivalent to only a quarter of the time the sponsors required her to appear on the scene, which was already very forgiving. But Zhao Yu was unable to promise that. “This was not stipulated in our early contract,” he merely said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The sponsors and the chief planner of the show were about to faint. Zhao Yu touched his forehead helplessly. He also couldn’t ask Yu Yaoyao, who was still breastfeeding, to come to work. Otherwise, Mr. Shen would probably kill him with his eyes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the husband and wife had a good relationship. Now that having a second child was allowed, he had long expected that Yu Yaoyao would give birth to a second baby. What was so strange about this?</p>
<p>“Relax, our program ratings are guaranteed. It is also stated in the sponsorship contract that if the popularity among the audience does not reach the minimum standard, we will refund a certain amount of the sponsorship.”</p>
<p>This clause was indeed quite special. Other program crews wouldn’t have the guts to do this, but Zhao Yu was very confident. He was not afraid of having a low number of viewers.</p>
<p>“Wait for it. Although Yu Yaoyao doesn’t have many shots in this issue, the popularity will still be very high.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu didn’t want to talk too much rubbish with these sponsors.</p>
<p>“Watch the show first. Then, we can discuss any problem later.”</p>
<p>After speaking, he happily hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Xiao Huang, the assistant who had been working with him for some time, was a little worried, “Will it really be okay? Director Zhao, I heard that Lao Zheng, who went to film Yu Yaoyao this time, said that she didn’t really want to show up, and it seemed that she really wants to rest for at least half a year. ”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu glanced at him. “It’s impossible for things to always work out your way. Guests and artists are all human beings, and they should also get to enjoy the benefits they deserve. When she was pregnant, we were the only program group who got the exclusive rights to film and interview her often, right? What other programs or media did you see have successfully invited her to join?”</p>
<p>Xiao Huang thought what he said did make sense. Zhao Yu shut him up.</p>
<p>“These sponsors had already made a lot of money when we got a lot of clicks. Yu Yaoyao’s ability to sell goods is first-class, and her performance far surpassed expectations – it even exceeded their historical return on investment. Although she is now recuperating, they wouldn’t suffer a loss even if the click went down. How can they be so greedy and inhumane to disagree with her taking a maternity leave? Did they forget their own mothers breastfeeding them?”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu ranted irritably. He also valued ​​Yu Yaoyao’s family very much now.</p>
<p>Now, the more Shen Rui appeared on the program, the more people would find him sensible and cute. Yu Yaoyao was raising Little Sweetheart, in the future, she might also be another sensible Baby Bun.  Zhao Yu couldn’t help but smile when he imagined Little Bun bringing his little sister on his show.</p>
<p>“Anyway, if you receive another phone call, just tell them I’m busy,” he instructed. “Our program is sold and sponsored as a whole. If they want to withdraw their sponsorship, the sponsorship for the previous issues have to be withdrawn together!”</p>
<p>Xiao Huang also responded quickly to what he said. But when the assistant left, Zhao Yu couldn’t help but clench his fist a little nervously as he looked at the playback screen in front of him.</p>
<p>“Even if the clicks might not be as high as the previous episode, it should still be higher than the first episode.”</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao was absent, more than half of the show’s jokes were lost. Zhao Yu understood the sponsors’ concerns. This was only the first episode without Yu Yaoyao. There was still a long way to go. The ratings and viewers would drop in the future episodes.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu gritted his teeth. He must hold on, no matter what! He must hold on until she is out of confinement!</p>
<p>While the sponsors felt that they were suffering huge losses, the program continued broadcasting.</p>
<p>Actor Chen Jiao and newly crowned best actress, Gu Qianqian, were all artists that could generate a lot of online traffic. However, other than the fans of the two artists, most of the audience were fans of Yu Yaoyao’s family.</p>
<p>After the program had been broadcasted for more than half an hour, most of the comments in the comment section were still ‘It’s a pity that Yaoyao couldn’t be here.’, ‘Will she be here in the next issue?’, and ‘Little Bun would only be happy when his mommy is here…’</p>
<p>It seemed that everyone was not in high spirits. But soon, when the audience saw Little Bun teaching Chen Jiao a lesson, and learning the conversation between Chen Jiao and Shen Yichong, the comments surged wildly.</p>
<p>What was the relationship between Chen Jiao and Shen Yichong in private? Did the two still bear hatred and stay away from each other? There were a lot of secrets that had never been revealed!</p>
