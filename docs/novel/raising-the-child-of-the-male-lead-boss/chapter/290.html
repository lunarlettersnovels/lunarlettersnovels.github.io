            <p><strong>Chapter 473</strong></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye found a large piece of paper and pasted it on the top of the computer desk, where she could see it clearly. Her note read:</p>
<p><em>‘9:00 -10:00: Memorize vocabulary</em></p>
<p><em>11:00 – 13:00: Eat and study with Teacher Gong</em></p>
<p><em>14:00 – 15:00: Swallow grammar books</em></p>
<p><em>16:00 to sleep time: Coding’</em></p>
<p>There were ten days left until she visited Yu Yaoyao’s house. That’s right, she was going to study hard, as if she was sitting for her college entrance examinations! Moreover, she even set up a date with a college English lecturer, Comrade Little Gong. From today onwards, they would be good friends!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye felt so ambitious to learn English. She didn’t even have time to manage the fans, so she could only entrust it to Ye Yun.</p>
<p>There were a lot of YY fans watching the live broadcast that day, and many people discovered their president was lucky enough to get her call picked up. Since then, the fan group had been very busy. Many girls were chatting and gossiping happily.</p>
<p><em>[‘Gentle Temper’ is our president, right?]</em></p>
<p><em>[That must be her. Our president is a super member who could use rainbow fonts!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Just curious, is our president an octopus? Her speed of grabbing orders is amazing! She got the takeaway twice!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I have always thought that our president was a professional writer, but I wasn’t expecting her to have such good English skills! Jealousy drives me crazy!]</em></p>
<p><em>[If you don’t study hard, you really can’t chase stars in the future!]</em></p>
<p><em>[@ President, please remember to take HD photos when you meet Yaoyao in-person. Share them with us here so I can help you touch-up!]</em></p>
<p><em>[@President, can you help me get a signed photo?]</em></p>
<p>The two @s made everyone in the group go crazy. Everyone then started to mention the president, asking her to bring gifts to the scene and help them get signed souvenirs. No one got any response from the president even when someone sent an exclusive red envelope to the president in the group.</p>
<p>Their president, who was always online, as if she didn’t need to work, seemed to have disappeared from the world.</p>
<p>Finally, the vice president spoke on her behalf.</p>
<p><em>[‘Gentle Temper’ is now working hard to prepare Yaoyao’s tutoring materials. She also must study intensively so she doesn’t have time to come online for the time being. The management matters in the group will be temporarily handed over to me and will be returned when ‘Gentle Temper’ comes back.]</em></p>
<p>This sentence made the fans in the group look at each other across the screen. Originally, they were happily watching and gossiping because someone close to them was finally meeting their idol. However, the vice president’s words instantly made them realize that the president was serious about the tutoring session. The president had even shut herself away from the world!</p>
<p>Many people in the group who watched the live broadcast roughly knew about Yaoyao’s English level. She entered art school because she wasn’t that good with English; frankly, her English level was probably around an elementary school students’ level. Her tutor would face a big problem, indeed!</p>
<p>Everyone couldn’t help but think about their own, and even their children’s, struggle with it.</p>
<p><em>[@vice president, I have the latest textbooks, do you want me to send them to the president? They’re ebooks! Can you still get in touch with her? My daughter is reading the first chapter. It’s very suitable for elementary school students and is especially helpful for reading practice.]</em></p>
<p>This mother was obviously a passionate fan.</p>
<p><em>[My little sister is in the fourth grade of elementary school. I am in the second grade of junior high school. I have the latest elementary school textbooks and workbooks. The president can PM me if she wants them!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Just finished the test, I have practice papers and key summaries that have been partly bitten by my dog. Do you want it?]</em></p>
<p>These were the lovely fans who were in their youth and were struggling in school. But Ye Yun didn’t know what was going on with Fang Qiuye. Ever since she said she was going to study hard, they hadn’t been in contact much. With that, she also didn’t know whether she should accept the help of their fellow comrades in the group.</p>
<p>If she did accept it, didn’t that also mean that she was assuming that Yaoyao only had primary school level English? It felt shameful to say that… But after all, everyone was on the same boat…</p>
<p>Maybe, by learning and studying hard, Yaoyao would soon reach the university level.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye also mentioned she found a very powerful helper. She even reassured her that Yaoyao would definitely learn faster!</p>
<p>After Ye Yun gave it a thought, she privately messaged a few fans who said they had ebooks of teaching materials. Then, she sent all the materials to Fang Qiuye after organizing them. She didn’t know if the other party was still free to surf the Internet, or, to be precise, do not know if she was still alive…</p>
<p>It was said that Fang Qiuye even had a heavy task of updating novels every day. Before, she was already losing hair due to her hectic schedule. Now that she also got an extra study task, Ye Yun wasn’t sure if Fang Qiuye would still have hair…</p>
<p>Ye Yun thought for a while and mailed Fang Qiuye a bottle of nutritional gummies from the United States that were said to be good for hair.</p>
<p>Then, she devoted herself to the daily task of managing the fan group. After that, she also had to study so that she could start her management work at Guangxin strategy department as soon as possible.</p>
