            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 148 – My Husband is a Bully (1)</strong></p>
<p>Zhou Qiu, who was left in the room, discovered something that rendered him even more speechless. Shen Yichong, who had ordered takeout for them, went to the kitchen to make breakfast for the hungry Yu Yaoyao and little bun himself.</p>
<p>To ensure that the food he prepared was clean, he lifted his shirt’s sleeves, washed his hands thoroughly and then started prepping the vegetables and condiments needed for cooking the dish. He also added some fried eggs as a side dish to flavor the meal. Why he did all this, he looked like a skillful and relaxed chef.</p>
<p>Just by looking at him, Zhou Qiu then realized that he was a man who would only cook for people he treasures. Soon after, a delicious scent wafted throughout the kitchen, indicating that someone’s cooking was delectable..</p>
<p>With two bowls of noodles in his hands, both large and small, Shen Yichong, brought out the food from the kitchen and was stopped by Zhou Qiu.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you order takeout?” The director asked.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at him with a gloomy look. “Children are not allowed to eat takeout.”</p>
<p>Director Zhou Qiu’s chest snapped.</p>
<p><em>Indeed! Mr. Shen is a good cook and a thoughtful person but is not open about it to others!</em></p>
<p>“Zhou Qiu, my son should not be included in the recording. I will strictly pay attention to it.” Shen Yichong uttered while re-entering the kitchen to prepare three cups of milk.</p>
<p>“Oh, but the recording is done for the whole day…” Zhou Qiu said in response to Mr. Shen’s request.</p>
<p>Just then, Yu Yaoyao came down from the second floor, her apparel that of a strap dress bringing out her youthfulness. She took the little bun, who wore a sky blue bib around his neck the same color as his mother’s dress, in his arms and into the dining room. The little bun’s small, round face was fair and smooth, and as cute as a pink jade doll.</p>
<p>The mother and the baby, wearing matching outfits together, made the staff and cameraman lose their senses from the adorable sight. Meanwhile, Zhou Qiu, who was forced to agree to Shen Yichong’s strict demand, regretted not being able to capture the moment.</p>
<p>If the public would see this on TV, it would make the girls and all mothers scream and say ‘Too cute!’ Indeed, this little bun and mother duo would tug the heartstrings of the viewers…</p>
<p>The little bun walked over to the dining table, bowed down and greeted them in a barely audible voice.</p>
<p><em>Polite and well-behaved.</em> He continued observing the child.</p>
<p>He even strived to sit down beside his mother, who had already sat down on the dining table, by climbing up to the children’s chair, without any help. After sitting down comfortably, he took a small serviette from the table and tied it around his neck. All movements were done in one go. When he was done showing off his breakfast etiquette, the little bun picked up the chopsticks from the table and offered it to his mother.</p>
<p>“Mommy, eat~”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu saw this, and he bravely asked Mr. Shen to allow his son to appear in the recording. But instead of answering, Shen Yichong lowered the child’s seat, and his thin lips lifted directly, denying the director of his request.</p>
<p>“Your mommy is an adult, use it for yourself.” Shen Yichong told his son.</p>
<p>“When you finish eating breakfast, Uncle Lin will take you to your favorite zoo.” Hearing this, the little bun pouted his mouth. However, when Yu Yaoyao heard the mention of her old home, her bright eyes turned dim immediately. Even the mere thought of it terrified her, especially when she remembers how she was previously treated in such a place. Since then, she has loathed all zoos.</p>
<p>She looked at the little bun with sadness in her eyes, “Mommy will wait for the little bun to come back home. We will play lots of games and then take a bath together. Okay?”</p>
<p>The little bun’s face slightly brightened, the corners of his mouth slightly raised and he thumped his feet excitedly, forgetting the fact he would not be able to take part in the filming. Soon after, he picked up his little spoon and quickly filled his mouth with noodles to eat. Taking one bite after another, his mouth was soon stuffed. It is evidently seen that he really liked the food his father sincerely made for him.</p>
<p>Monitoring behind the camera, Zhou Qiu soon discovered that Yu Yaoyao, beside the little bun, was exactly the same as him. Her cheeks were even fuller and she didn’t even care how much noodles were stuffed in her mouth.</p>
<p><em>The mother and her kid are just the same!</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows furrowed. “Eat slowly or there will be no meal next time.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao whined pitifully, staring at him with her unshed tears. But at his warning, she then started to eat slowly. The little bun gave his mom a sympathetic look, patting her back with his small hand. Almost forgetting that his own small mouth, like hers, chewed fast like a hamster.</p>
