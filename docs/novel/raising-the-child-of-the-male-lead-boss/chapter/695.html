            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 56 – An Elusive Beauty (2)</strong></p>
<p>It is a wrong strategy to let a person see the whole picture. One must hide among the trees, half-exposed and half-hidden, to let tourists be filled with a frenzied expectation to look for her with their keen eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore, she still sat on the car seat with only a long leg displayed outside. Instead of rushing out, she turned around to take out the sunglasses in her small purse.</p>
<p>Only her side profile was displayed to the photographers!</p>
<p>After, she thanked the nanny van driver for his hard work before finally getting off gracefully and slowly.</p>
<p>Only then did everyone see her whole picture.</p>
<p>Above the pair of chunky snow boots… is a light and lovely crimson chiffon dress, which made her waist look slender and highlighted the curves of her chest. This look was completed with a pure white wool coat draped around her, adding a bit of earthly aesthetic.</p>
<p>And her dark, curly hair which was casually tied to a low ponytail behind her head, was a very casual style. But her beautiful little face lined with her v-shaped jaw, set off quite a goddess temperament.</p>
<p>And when the photographers moved their camera lens up and magnified the view to give her a close-up of her delicate face, they sighed deeply in their hearts.</p>
<p>Because her beautiful facial features were largely obscured by dark glasses. The only thing exposed is her plump, delicate lips with an apricot colored lip balm over it.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was still easily frightened by too many cameras. So, he turned back nervously to remind Yu Yaoyao, “Sister, relax, okay? Just like usual.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao merely replied with a calm smile; she is not nervous at all.</p>
<p>How many people visited the park yearly? The different types of temperaments ranging from children to adults—she’s not even afraid of the explosive number people in the park during golden holidays!</p>
<p>Therefore, she walked with her new human body in a natural grace, like a seasoned actress under the scrutiny of the public. It may be from the instincts of her old life, or it can be attributed to the numerous times she had imagined on how the figures of humans walk on the stage.</p>
<p>She didn’t wear high heels, opting for flat-bottomed boots. One theoretically can’t bring out the aura of a diva walking down the runway, but her every step on the way made the passersby unable to take their eyes off her…there was a kind of naturality in her walk—she exuded an indescribable atmosphere!</p>
<p>All the people holding their cameras watched her coming closer, step by step, rendered speechless for some time.</p>
<p>Even when she took off her sunglasses, nodded and smiled kindly at them, they didn’t catch her close-up expressions on camera in time!</p>
<p>“Who is that goddess!?”</p>
<p>“My hands were almost shaking. When she got off the car, it felt like I was photographing a big shot!”</p>
<p>“Was that the wife of the Guangxin entertainment CEO?  It seems that there are only two people left after her.”</p>
<p>“I want to go and be the boss; it must be a great blessing having a goddess by his side!”</p>
<p>“I bet she might snatch the top position this time! Her appearance under the lens is beyond perfect!”</p>
<p>“Tut, we’ll just have to see… I dare not say anything for now!”</p>
<p>The photographers who chatted in low voiced with themselves, turned off their cameras as they walked in.</p>
<p>“I remember older brother Xu followed after her?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t this older brother’s luck too much?”</p>
<p>“All close-up shots and even those from afar are splendid. How envious! Do you think older brother Xu would like to exchange positions with me?”</p>
<p>“Dream on! I also want to exchange!”</p>
<p>Their eyes brightened one by one. For photographers, it is very exciting to meet a beautiful woman with is photogenic, enabling them to take photos without hassle or photoshop!</p>
<p>As for acting, they were really not concerned with this aspect…</p>
<p>Of course, Yu Yaoyao and Ni Yi did not hear these.</p>
<p>Soon after Ni Yi walked in, his face almost turned red. “Whatever do you mean, director?”</p>
<p>Zheng Qiuhua, the deputy director of the program in charge for the group’s filming, frowned as his fingers paused, hovering over his laptop.</p>
<p>“For the first round, we have 88 positions. Everyone is ranked according to their own strength…but they can make the choice. For example, if you think you are number one, you choose room number one. The top seven each have their own separate rooms, the next 20 are to stay in a room by pairs, and the remaining four—”</p>
<p>Ni Yi shook his head, “Not that. If I’m not mistaken, you said that there are only two positions left? Furthermore, it’s just the last and the first?”</p>
<p>Zheng Qiuhua shrugged his shoulders and looked helpless. “Many of the contestants already arrived two or three hours in advance and had already chosen their desired number.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi stared at him in shock, “You didn’t inform us beforehand that we get to choose the position! You should know, we also arrived early too!”</p>
<p>His face turned white. If they choose the first place and get eliminated on the first round, what face would they have left?! And choosing the last place is equivalent to being insecure, and a lack of confidence in the artist is a big taboo in the entertainment circle. Even if one performs dutifully and properly, they will still be scolded afterward. A pitiful start, owing to vicious people who preyed on the weak.</p>
<p>And these two were the only choices left!</p>
