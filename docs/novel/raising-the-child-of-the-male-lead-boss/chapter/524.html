            <p><strong>Chapter 239 – Suffering An Injustice (3)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Livyuna</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Proofreader: Livyuna</em></p>
<p>Upon their exit, Jia Zijie back in the studio quickly rang up, “Boss, it’s done. We will send out a press release to change the endorser soon.”</p>
<p>Although after a while, he felt the originally noisy studio behind him suddenly quiet down into an eerie blanket of silence.</p>
<p>Soon, a shadow loomed over him. Jia Zijie went cold, and found himself turning back. The smug smile plastered his face was soon wiped out.</p>
<p>“Shen Yichong?!” His voice came out choked.</p>
<p>The man in front of him stood sharply in a crisp suit and shiny leather shoes. Pure black, searing eyes pierced through Jia Zijie with an unsympathetic look.</p>
<p>“Excellent diamond? It’s still a rubbish brand.” Shen Yichong turned his watch. The gesture reminds him of a Buddha’s hand. “My wife liked you, hence I allowed her to pick this project.”</p>
<p>Jia Zijie’s face contorted in fury. “Shen Yichong! Insulting our company — is this the sick practice of the boss of failed entertainment company? You truly are at a dead end to be acting so shamefully!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong clenched his thin lips sourly, looking at Jia Zijie mockingly in retort. “Even the entire Crocker brand has never been on my wife’s shopping list, not even at the end.”</p>
<p>Jia Zijie couldn’t help but grit his teeth, “CEO Shen, you are responsible for what you have said today! I will not hesitate to give feedback to the marketing department from the headquarters. Guangxin artists will never be able to receive sponsorships from our brand in the future!”</p>
<p>“Rubbish. It will only lower Guangxin Entertainment’s refined quality. Wait for my lawyer’s letter.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao passed by, turning to leave immediately. They did not bother to afford him a final look.</p>
<p>Jia Zijie’s chest heaved rapidly. It was not until the couple were out from his site did his anger unfurled.</p>
<p>“What!? Isn’t he just some nouveau riche after a successful startup? He’s gone this time; he won’t be able to get back up at all!”</p>
<p>After all, their marketing department evaluated Guangxin Entertainment’s steep decline.</p>
<p>As soon as Shen Yichong walked out, Jia Zijie proceeded to command the public relations department with a dark and gloomy expression. His fingers took him to the Weibo app, a fast, scathing remark flying from his fingertips and pouring into the screen.</p>
<p><strong>[ExcellentDiamondV: The brand has been reluctant to give up, but after a very thorough discussion, we regret to make an appointment with @Yu YaoyaoV the next time. Each of our diamonds undergo high-quality screening. The shine emitted from the inside is most essential, and should be lacking from any fractures and impurities.]</strong></p>
<p>The statement indicating the contract’s termination was unusually creative. However, many are good at reading comprehension, especially on the internet. They may have immediately grasped the point.</p>
<p><strong>[Are you implying Yu Yaoyao has poor character? She lacks sparkle from the inside?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This is mocking Yu Yayao!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Is the Chinese class representative coming?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Why are you speaking in riddles? With all honesty, does Yu Yaoyao not have any ability? Excellent Diamond, you must show this to the world]</strong></p>
<p>Many of the public’s interpretation has all gone in a similar direction.</p>
<p>As expected, it was her fans who were strongly dissatisfied.</p>
<p><strong>[Excellent Diamond, are you out of your mind? You have an addiction to writing jokes— writing about termination!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I warned you Excellent Diamond, you will fall responsible for your actions. Don’t be insinuating, even if you refuse to cooperate, you will pay for what you did to my wife! Besides, your company does not have the resources to have separate marketing. I can even donate some to you!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[No cooperation, no cooperation! Is Excellent Diamond even worthy of my wife’s beauty?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[With your writing ability, I don’t want to purchase any of your diamonds!]</strong></p>
<p>Most of the people’s doubts quickly occupied a majority of the comments section.</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who heard of the announcement while driving, almost swerved perilously on the road.  “Sister, these people are absolutely shameless!”</p>
<p>But he definitely did not expect to vomit blood even more.</p>
<p>Soon, several Weibo users claiming to be staff members, have begun posting a series of on-site photos and edited videos. One had Yu Yaoyao dressed as a sailor, looking indifferent, and with such a hazy facial expression. The videos revealed her to be walking too slowly in front of the camera. Others showcased a picture of the staff and other actors waiting on the scene, but Yu Yaoyao was not present. There was even a short clip of Director Ji Chang often accusing her of being undedicated, tardy, and dull in performance.</p>
<p>The Weibo posts were hastily forwarded by various big marketing accounts, and even those of entertainment outlets. The surge struck immense disbelief to thousands of Yu Yaoyao’s fans.</p>
<p>In the end, Youzuan public relations had to issue a statement stipulating that it wasn’t painful. They obviously had to put up a face.</p>
<p><strong>[Excellent Diamond V: Dedication and professionalism are the quality benchmarks of Excellent Diamond. We regret to say that Yu Yaoyao was different from our company’s vision.]</strong></p>
<p>Many people caused a ruckus, jumping and shouting at Yu Yaoyao’s expected fall. That her road would turn black, as dim as her supposed talent.</p>
<p>Ni Yi held the phone tightly, enough of a chokehold if it were a person. “Sister, we fortunately kept a hidden card. Otherwise, they would have almost hacked us this time!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded, patting his Ni Yi’s back comfortingly. “It’s too scary, but the mobile phone is a good thing, for now.”</p>
<p>At this point, despite the riot, she was already a bit calm and refreshed. “Where is my husband? We’re about to arrive on the next set. Isn’t he going to see me act?”</p>
