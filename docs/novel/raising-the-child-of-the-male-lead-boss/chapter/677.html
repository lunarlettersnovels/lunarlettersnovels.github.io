            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 74 – Shattered</strong></p>
<p>Soon, the director’s assistant asked everyone to do their final makeup and finish their clothing preparation. And according to their sequence, they filed in a line, starting to enter the prop room to choose their props for the shoot.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao brazenly yawned in front of the camera, while still maintaining the air of graceful madam; her eyes squeezed out two crocodile tears.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll just sleep for a while. Older brother photographer eldest brother, when it’s my turn, please call me, yo.”</p>
<p>When Ni Yi heard these words, his fat face revealed a speechless expression.</p>
<p><em>You slept all the way in the car! What are you doing at night that you can’t sleep properly?</em> His mouth twitched helplessly.</p>
<p>Well, thinking about it…it’s quite convincing why she would be lethargic. Since she was already rushed to the hospital by a minor concussion because of the boss, it’s only clear then that those two are out of control the two at night!</p>
<p>Audiences, who had signed up for early registration for entry, poured into the set one after another. Several veteran judges have also started to arrive at the scene.</p>
<p>Finally, all sixty-eight contestants finished choosing their props. And inside the preparation room, as everyone held their respective props, they diligently prepared their performance for their character’s scene.</p>
<p>But Ni Yi who was only a bystander watching from the sideline could only get increasingly anxious as he watched the still sleeping—and drooling, Yu Yaoyao!</p>
<p>His sister had no choice but to follow the voted sequence and go last. In the end, the assistant director directly put the last and only prop remaining beside her. Yet, she didn’t even wake up at the slightest disturbance, as if she was adamant to sleep even if an apocalypse were to come!</p>
<p>The older brother photographer wanted to wake her up and ask her to prepare for her topic. But he had his lens on a close-up, her red lips moved, and she mumbled softly in her sleep.</p>
<p>“Husband, don’t make so much noise…”</p>
<p>“You feed me breakfast too… ”</p>
<p>“I want to eat sweet pudding, huhu, it’s so delicious…”</p>
<p>As she talked in her sleep, glistening saliva flowed down along her lips.</p>
<p>The older brother photographer was suddenly stunned stupid! The assistant director felt silly! And her manager, Ni Yi, was entirely about to collapse!</p>
<p>“Director, can this shot be cut off from the broadcast? This…this should not be shot by the camera!” Ni Yi was so anxious that he was wiping another batch of sweat.</p>
<p>His elder sister actually slept in front of the camera and cried out to her husband to feed her–he really wants to faint!</p>
<p>If this scene is broadcasted, the internet will blow up again because of his sister’s absurd behavior on camera! And let’s not even talk about what face the boss might make.</p>
<p><em>Is there a female artist who does this? What about the super beauty goddess Fan?</em></p>
<p>But while Ni Yi was in the middle of an internal breakdown, the assistant director refused his plea.</p>
<p>“We shot it real time. The final broadcast will also depend on the chief director’s call,” he said, looking at her sleeping frame, as he held the camera momentarily when the older photographer when to wake up Yu Yaoyao. After the photographer shook Yu Yaoyao lightly by the shoulders, she woke up with a soft cough.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. She’s beautiful when she’s asleep–not ugly at all.” The assistant director patted Ni Yi comfortingly on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s face suddenly turned green. <em>This, this is to be included in the broadcast? OH MY GOD!</em></p>
<p>Perhaps his monologues were entirely too strong that it directly woke up the sleeping Yu Yaoyao in front of the camera. After which, the moment she woke up, she wiped her saliva in a daze, subconsciously looking at the camera. Her little mouth snapped open and close twice, revealing a look of regret.</p>
<p><em>It was all a dream. The sweet pudding wasn’t real. My husband feeding me wasn’t real. My dream is shattered… what a pity.</em></p>
<p>She didn’t speak at all, but her thoughts were clearly written on her face. And the minuscule changes in her expressions were really accurate and clear, that onlookers could see at a glance what she was thinking about.</p>
<p>Ni Yi hurriedly wiped away his sweat.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Yu Yaoyao’s poor acting skills would make his heart beat out of his chest in severe anxiety. There was also her inability to even make an expressive face. However, her excessively clear expression today made him almost see black!</p>
<p>Oh, his elder sister–does she know where they currently are, or does she think it’s alright to fool around? He’s too struck with worry!</p>
<p>Ni Yi eyes, like ants on a hot pot, anxiously looked around with no direction. Bit in the next second, he saw her slowly awaken, as if she finally remembered what today was after seeing the older brother photographer.</p>
<p>“Hi!” Yu Yaoyao out her hand and easily smiled towards the camera. She got up slowly from the bench, stretched her muscles and covered her yawning mouth.</p>
<p>Clearly, this was something you do at home, away from the vicinity of strangers. Yet her delicate small face, lithe body and her whole bearing resemble that of an ancient diva. Her movements were elegant, her smile gentle and charming, yet in the midst of it all, she was still able to retain an innocent, cute charm. Even the way she stretched was enough to attract people’s attention.</p>
<p>The older photographer, Zheng, immediately and keenly locked the camera on her.  Meanwhile, the assistant director felt she had <em>something</em> to her; in the entire, tense preparation room, she was unique and full of strange highlights.</p>
<p>He stepped forward and spoke, “Yu Yaoyao, here is your prop. You’ve got half an hour to get ready. Your performance topic is– ” he handed the note to her and gave the photographer beside a subtle look.</p>
<p>Photographer Zheng immediately caught the signal. <em>There must be something explosive with this topic!</em></p>
<p>He instantly zoomed in to take a close-up shot! First, he started with the prop in her hand—it was a small bronze mirror, the size of a palm, which looks antique.</p>
<p>But…the mirror was broken in the middle as if was shattered somehow by intention.</p>
<p>“A contestant accidentally knocked the mirror to the ground.” The assistant director calmly said, eyeing the side where Meng Xinran’s small group were and then finally looking at Yu Yaoyao with a quiet glance.</p>
