            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 160 – Besotted Husband (2)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who’d just finished her photoshoot, bought a cake and went home. A few moments later, she received a call from screenwriter Liu Yazhi. They discussed for a while the direction of her character in the drama.</p>
<p>Even after the screenwriter finished her work, she was still reluctant to let go of Yu Yaoyao, especially of her performance today. Every time she checked her phone’s new wallpaper, she would invariably remember Yu Yaoyao’s smile and her every emotion when she waltzed out of the makeup room. Thus, without any hesitation, she’d called Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>The more she thought of it, the more she was afraid that she would not perform the character well and finally disappoint her. With her deep love for her responsibilities and characters, Liu Yazhi’s expectations and demands for Yu Yaoyao had increased alongside her appreciation.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, am I disturbing you right now? I would like to discuss with you the scene in which Yu Ji jumps off from the roof and commits suicide after the subjugation of the kingdom. Are you able to grasp the emotion of the character at that point?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was sitting on the dining chair, gazing at the delicious cake in front of her, drooling. She was about to scoop the icing of the cake with her finger for a taste when her phone rang.</p>
<p>“Uhm, I’m free.” She blankly stared at one corner of the room and faintly sighed.</p>
<p><em>It is extremely disappointing! </em>Sadness filled her, she couldn’t taste the icing of the cake.</p>
<p>The screenwriter’s voice immediately became very excited. “What do you think about it? You can say anything.” Yu Yaoyao took the dessert fork and put it in her mouth, she looked at Ni Yi with heavy eyes.</p>
<p><em>Why? At a time like this, ugh!</em></p>
<p>“Aside from being so beautiful, she already has everything; wealth, status, and an outstanding army that is envied by all the kingdoms in the world. What’s the use of committing suicide?” The screenwriter prodded.</p>
<p>She held out a hand to scrape the cream on top of the cake but Ni Yi moved the cake away.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Freedom please… why don’t you give it to me?!” Her voice was filled with indignation.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was rendered speechless when he heard Yu Yaoyao’s answer to the screenwriter. He silently and reluctantly mouthed words to Yu Yaoyao so that the screenwriter would not be able to hear it. “Seriously … sister…”</p>
<p>Liu Yazhi was a well-known screenwriter in China and at the top of the echelon! She’s not fooling around, right now. If this ‘sister’ were to provoke the writer, she should be ready to dig a hole for herself.</p>
<p>Ni Yi immediately took out a small notebook from his bag and asked her to say a more appropriate answer. But when he was about to finish writing the words ‘national subjugation’, he heard the voice from over the phone.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes! That’s correct!” Liu Yazhi’s voice suddenly became half a pitch higher. “Life is precious. Love is more expensive. But you can abandon all of it for freedom! You were able to interpret this character way deeper than I thought!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was dumbstruck.</p>
<p>Liu Yazhi was amazed. To her, Yu Yaoyao had accurately interpreted the entire being of Yu Ji that she’d passionately created. It was as if she was born to have that profound understanding. She immediately filled in her muse with the nuances of the said character.</p>
<p>“Although Yu Ji was spoiled with glory and wealth, she lost her freedom and was imprisoned in the city walls robbing her of all her happiness. Therefore, instead of yielding to the traitors, she chose to kill herself. To die for love… love for her kingdom. It is really rare for anyone to know Yu Ji’s character this well, until where have you read the script?</p>
<p>Ni Yi glanced at his sister who was still staring at the cake. The words from the other side just now made his heart beat very loud and clear.</p>
<p><em>Is this okay?</em></p>
<p>The screenwriter went on and on, even asking how she would handle her emotions for several important plots in the drama. Though Yu Yaoyao lacked the basic knowledge on human psychology, she knew that Yu Ji was very much beautiful, but did not really appreciate her beauty. That said, she didn’t recognize the sufferings and pain of the people around the world.</p>
<p>All of sudden, she’d delved deep into a conversation with Liu Yazhi.</p>
<p>“Of course, the most terrible thing is to not have freedom. She was once free, but it was ruthlessly snatched away from her… how painful it is just to just look at the wall, and imagine the grass and trees outside as well as the birds and the bugs…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed when she thought of her own past.</p>
<p>“If we say that it is her beauty’s fault, that she did not choose to be born beautiful… or, was she given a choice in the first place? The world cannot understand her because they have never been that beautiful, and that kind of beauty bears a heavy burden,” Yu Yaoyao said and touched her chest. “Of course, if she was given the choice, she would still choose beauty!”</p>
<p>“To be beautiful until the very end!” Liu Yazhi was almost speechless with excitement when she heard this. In just a few minutes, she realized that she had really misunderstood Yu Yaoyao before and was too preconceived of her.</p>
<p>If Zhou Lin had not insisted upon giving her the role, the character would’ve never been performed by an artist par excellence.</p>
<p>“How many times did you read the script to have such an in-depth understanding of the character of Yu Ji in the drama?”</p>
<p>“Not much, I’ve recited it to my husband several times. If I made a mistake, I would be punished. If I missed a word, I’d be punished nonetheless!”</p>
