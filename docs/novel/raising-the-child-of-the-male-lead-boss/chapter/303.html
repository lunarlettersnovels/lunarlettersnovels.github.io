            <p><strong>Chapter 460</strong></p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu was soon notified by Ni Yi. In the next four episodes of the program, they had a new suggestion: a mobile food truck!</p>
<p>Zhao Yu had a keen sense of direction. Before he even started filming, he thought it was a good idea. At the same time, he also received a new variety show cooperation production invitation from Chen Lin.</p>
<p>It was labeled <em>‘Trainee 100’.</em></p>
<p>All 16 to 25-year-old youths across the country who were interested could audition. However, only six winners would be selected in the end. They would sign with Guangxin Entertainment and obtain massive resources and guidance from famous teachers. Among the tentative judges, there were several famous senior musicians from Guangxin. The format and content of the competition were very innovative.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was also very excited about this invitation. Although previously <em>‘In the Stage’</em> achieved good results, it had a lot to do with having a dark horse like Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Now, it would be good to have another trainee competition program. Especially since the public loved these kinds of shows. And when he said he wanted to think about it, Chen Lin soon came up with a second contract. This time it said: <em>‘Coffee Shop’.</em></p>
<p>Zhao Yu’s heart jumped suddenly! Guangxin made another big move.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Soon, it was time for the recording of the new episode of ‘Welcome to My Home’.</p>
<p>The new content and form of the program was soon completed under Ye Yun, Yu Yaoyao and Little Bun’s combined efforts.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu also kept his marketing strategy low-key before by trying to achieve a blockbuster performance during the live broadcast of this show. There was an influx of audience just after a while the live was broadcasted.</p>
<p>However, since there was no notice beforehand, and everyone knew that Yu Yaoyao wouldn’t appear anyway, the number of viewers grew significantly lower today. There were only a few hundred people chatting in the live broadcast room even after ten minutes of the broadcast.</p>
<p>Of course, this also had a lot to do with what Director Zhao said during the first shot. Before the broadcast started, Zhao Yu warmed up and talked to everyone.</p>
<p><em>“Everyone knows that we can’t head to the originally planned location of ‘Welcome to My Home’ due to Little Sweetheart’s arrival,” </em>he began. <em>“We’ve disappointed many of the audience.”</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the audience was not impressed, especially when Director Zhao introduced the guests. When they saw the guests were just two actors that people barely knew, many of them quit the live broadcast.</p>
<p><em>[Where’s Little Bun?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Did the guests bribe the program team to join the show? I don’t even know them, and I doubt if Yaoyao know them? How can they be a guest?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Director Zhao, can you move away from the camera a little? I can see your wrinkles… By the way, where is this spot?]</em></p>
<p><em>[There’s no Little Bun or Yaoyao… this is so disappointing. I have to go to work, so I’ll quit the live broadcast first.]</em></p>
<p>While many YY fans decided to quit the live broadcast, some people still insisted to stay. Among them were Fang Qiuye, the president of the fan club, who received a text message from Ye Yun before. Originally, she was also planning to quit, but she had received a secret text from Ye Yun, asking her to hold on for at least half an hour.</p>
<p>So, she decided to stay. Then, she realized something was fishy after 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Director Zhao turned the camera of the live broadcast, exposing the corner of a familiar living room.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t this the scene from ‘My Wife and I’?” Fang Qiuye widened her eyes. “Gosh, they’re back at Yaoyao’s house for this episode? They didn’t go out to record!”</p>
<p>Sister Yun was now working in Guangxin, but she did not disclose her specific position. She only said she met Mr. Shen and Yaoyao. It seemed that Sister Yun had gotten insider information!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was immediately excited. Then, she saw the familiar kitchen of Yaoyao’s house and a busy but slender figure wearing a small yellow duck apron inside.</p>
<p>“Hello, everyone!” the woman greeted. “Today, Yaoyao’s Online Kitchen finally opens!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s face was bare from makeup, save for a little lip balm. She waved at everyone while holding a spatula.</p>
<p>“Lunch dishes will include steamed eggplants, fried pork tenderloin with garlic, and egg fried rice,” she cheerfully said. “By the way, can the director please send the link to the live broadcast room? We can only deliver orders to places within 20 kilometres. It’s on a first come first served basis, and we only have 10 sets!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye couldn’t believe what she saw. She hurriedly clicked on the link to the live broadcast room. Yaoyao’s online restaurant even had a business license and a health license!</p>
<p>She ordered her orders with trembling hands! <em>‘Quick, hands! Move!’ </em>she thought. Only a small audience within 20 kilometres! She was so lucky!</p>
<p>After completing the order, she could almost hear the pounding of her chest. Then, she started admiring Yaoyao’s cooking posture in the live broadcast..</p>
<p><em>‘Hmm… a bit messy. Quick and energetic.’</em></p>
<p>While she cut the vegetables irregularly, her speed wasn’t bad at all! Then there was also Mr. Shen to guide her step by step. Not only that, there was even a chef from a renowned Chinese restaurant next to her.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’m done learning. I’m going to work on the order from <em>Gentle Temper</em>!” Yu Yaoyao announced.</p>
<p>‘Gentle Temper’ Fang Qiuye’s username in her social media account.</p>
<p>Soon, Fang Qiuye witnessed her food come out of the pot with her own eyes and carefully placed into the container by Shen Rui himself. Although the soup spilled a lot and some vegetable leaves fell out, Fang Qiuye was not angry at all. Food made by her idol was already an amazing experience itself!</p>
<p>She waited anxiously as she watched the live broadcast, even refusing when her roommate called her for dinner. She must wait for Yaoyao’s meal on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes of anxious waiting, her doorbell finally rang!</p>
<p>“Hello, order for Gentle Temper.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye almost jumped up and ran to open the door. “Yes, it’s mine!” She was about to grab it, but her hand faltered midway.</p>
<p>The delivery man in front of her was wearing a crisp suit and had a cold face without a hint of a smile… this was… “Mr. She-Shen…” she stuttered.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your order. Have a nice meal,” Shen Yichong smiled politely.</p>
<p>“What!!” Fang Qiuye couldn’t help but scream. Then she could see a camera from behind. “What!!!” She screamed again. “I-I-I-I’m on TV too!?”</p>
<p>She ordered food cooked by Yaoyao, and the delivery man was the boss himself, Mr. Shen!</p>
