            <h3>Chapter 196 – Kissing Scene (2)</h3>
<p>That sentence was based on her snake instinct, but she decided not to say it so that Zhou Lin would not get angrier. Zhou Lin instantly raised his eyebrow and madly gazed at Yu Haiquan.</p>
<p>Yu Haiquan really hated the fact that the director just madly questioned him. “Director, don’t scold me like that!”</p>
<p><em>Who would kiss a married woman, especially in front of her husband! Of course, he wouldn’t dare kiss her! Her husband is present, and he doesn’t want to kiss her!</em></p>
<p>Soon, Yu Haiquan touched his nose and stood up.</p>
<p>“Director Zhou, first of all, listen to me…” Now, he decided to open up and turned his script in the corner. “That scene where you praised me earlier, I actually thought of Yaoyao as a sausage with a lot of tomato sauce and mayonnaise that I haven’t eaten for three months.” As Yu Haiquan spoke, he still couldn’t help but swallow his saliva.</p>
<p>Zhou Lin: “…!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Yu Haiquan immediately turned to look at Yu Yaoyao. Soon, he showed the director the unique secret that Yu Yaoyao taught him and the circled parts on his script.</p>
<p>In the first scene, he saw Yu Yaoyao, fell in love with her, and wanted to take her away, but he couldn’t do it. He had to be patient and wait for the appropriate time to take her away.</p>
<p>In the script, when he saw a hotdog and wanted to eat it, he told himself he should control because he needed to lose weight. He motivated himself with the thought that when he successfully became the next film emperor, he would definitely buy a box of hot dogs and devour them!</p>
<p>Zhou Lin cradled his head, and the method of thinking about food while performing was spread throughout the entire filming site!</p>
<p>“I hate such thinking, but I can’t rip off Yu Yaoyao’s clothes right now as it turns out to be helpful!” Yu Haiquan nodded as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I was also worried at first, but after trying it once, I found out that Yu Yaoyao was right. Human desires might be different, but they all have something in common. Love or desire and appetite may seem different, but the way to express them is quite similar.”</p>
<p>“… I am old,” Zhou Lin said and sighed.</p>
<p>In the future, when he’d meet new actors, he would share this new trick and tell the story behind this trick.</p>
<p>Yu Haiquan continued. “Just now, just like what President Shen said, I just lost my only family member in the world. I wasn’t able to think through this part at first, but after using Yu Yaoyao’s idea…” He couldn’t help but smile… “When I thought about losing my mother, I realized that even if a Michelin three-star chef were cooking for me, I wouldn’t be able to eat… that time wouldn’t I feel like eating hotdogs either …”</p>
<p>Zhou Lin’s jaw dropped.</p>
<p>He hadn’t imagined such an excellent idea before, but now it sounded very reasonable! At first, he thought that Emperor Zhou Huang was brutal and became more cruel and ruthless since his mother’s death. He felt that since he lost an important person, Emperor Zhou will use his body to relieve the pain… Like a beast seeking for love.</p>
<p>But as soon as Yu Haiquan talked about hotdogs, Zhou Lin felt that his previous understanding was wrong. Shen Yichong was right, he was a man first then a crazy tyrant. If there were still a trace of softness in his heart, it would be due to the passing of his mother. So, aside from hotdogs, even if someone was offered big meals, they would never have an appetite at times like these.</p>
<p><em>They should not kiss anymore!</em></p>
<p>His mother was the first most beautiful woman he saw in the world, and now after seeing the beautiful Yu Ji, it would only remind him of the pain of losing his mother!</p>
<p><em>It’s no problem to perform that part without the kissing! </em></p>
<p>Zhou Lin’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Just now, Yu Yaoyao’s impromptu modification to the script was apt!</p>
<p>“Okay, very good! Your thoughts are right. I’ve neglected this detail for a long time. That scene earlier passed!” Zhou Lin waved his hand and laughed.</p>
<p>But he paused, raised his eyebrows, and asked something, “Yu Yaoyao, show me your script.”</p>
<p>She’d skewed Yu Haiquan, and therefore it was conceivable as to how wonderful her marks on her scripts were.</p>
<p>As soon as Yu Yaoyao heard him call her name, she immediately became nervous! Like a thief, she put her hands behind her back and desperately shook it towards Ni Yi, who was in the corner. However, “My Wife and I” team was inside and was able to capture such a cute moment. How could they miss such an incredible content?</p>
