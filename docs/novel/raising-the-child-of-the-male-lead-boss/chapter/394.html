            <p><strong>Chapter 369</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Now that the date for the premiere was fixed, Yu Yaoyao needed to plan her outfit for the event.</p>
<p>She was no longer an actress that no one knew, not to mention that her role of Sheng Ji in ‘Chaos’ was also very distinctive. She also came from a very wealthy family; it was doubtless that the media would focus on her.</p>
<p>“Sis, I have talked to Gu Qianqian’s manager. She is going to be wearing a solemn lavender and white dress by Chanel. It’s quite suitable for formal occasions,” Ni Yi reported after his research. “The other actresses in attendance are mainly going to be wearing pink and light green. We can’t choose these colors, and we can’t choose colors that are too bright. We don’t want to steal the spotlight from the leading actresses.”</p>
<p>There were many rules when it came to the entertainment industry. Not only did seniority matter, but juniors were also expected not to snatch the spotlight from their seniors. It was only reasonable, especially if the supporting actress and leading actress were on a good terms. It was like a wedding, where a bridesmaid was expected to not steal the limelight away from the bride.</p>
<p>“Sure. Whatever you want. My beauty no longer needs the support of clothing to attract everyone’s attention,” Yu Yaoyao said confidently.</p>
<p>Ni Yi nodded and showed her some pictures on his phone. “These are some everyday outfits from ADOLE. If you like them, I’m sure they’ll sponsor you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked through the items until she came to a low-key, dark colored dress.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the experience in her previous life, but she had always been particularly fond of clothing that showed her slender legs.</p>
<p>The pure black dress by ADOLE was also very suitable for formal occasions. The neat, round neck design was flattering, the form-fitting cut would show her waistline, and the fluffy, wavy mid-thigh length skirt would showcase her legs perfectly.</p>
<p>“This is the one.”</p>
<p>Black would also be very low-key at the event, since many men usually wore black blazers and suits for formal occasions. This way, she wouldn’t be stealing the spotlight from any of the female actresses.</p>
<p>“I’ll be humble. After all, colors can’t suppress my beauty.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi thought this dress was too low-key. But he swallowed his opinion when he heard what she said. “Then I will contact them and have them send it ASAP so you can try it on.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who had been helping Little Bun with his mathematics class in the living room, couldn’t help but listen in. Hearing what they said, he raised his eyebrows in surprise. He turned his head to glance at his confident wife.</p>
<p>Since she was at home, Yu Yaoyao was wearing comfortable clothes. On the front of her shirt was a big pink Peppa Pig, and she was wearing light green cotton pajamas bottoms. Her pretty, energetic face was pinkish, making her cheeks look like small apples. She looked like a young girl enjoying a rest day in her pajamas. But even in such casual clothes, she was eye-catching.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t help but smile slightly. Anything she wore would be stunning on her. She would attract the attention of any man near her. He decided that her choice to go low-key was a wise one. As he turned his gaze away, he noticed that his son, who was sitting next to him, had also become distracted by the conversation.</p>
<p>Little Bun had poked his round head out from under Shen Yichong’s arm and was staring at his mother.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong could clearly see the curiosity on Little Bun’s face when he lowered his head to look at him. It looked like he was trying to stay silent. His little cheeks were bulging, and his dark eyes were sparkling wildly. Even though he wanted to speak, he was resisting the urge because of the lesson he’d learned.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t help but feel relieved. His son had finally kicked his bad habit. He was progressing, and as his father, it was his duty not to be too harsh on him.</p>
<p>“What do you want to say?” Shen Yichong touched his son’s fluffy hair as a sign of encouragement.</p>
<p>Shen Rui’s face lit up once he was granted permission to speak. He stretched out his hand towards Uncle Ni Yi. “I also want to see what Mommy is going to be wearing.” As he spoke, he looked between the big Peppa Pig his mother was wearing, then down at the little Peppa Pig on his shirt. His eyes narrowed as he smiled. He and Mommy were wearing matching outfits! “Daddy, do we have tickets for the premiere? I want to watch Mommy’s TV show too.”</p>
<p>“It’s a movie,” Shen Yichong corrected. “It’s going to be a very long day, and you usually go to bed at 8 o’clock. There will also be a lot of people on the scene, so you won’t be able to talk to Mommy. You’ll only be able to watch from the audience seat.”</p>
<p>Little Bun blinked and pouted in disappointment. But he refused to give up that easily. “Can I sleep there? Maybe, I will wake up halfway through my rest and see Mommy on the screen.”</p>
<p>The most important thing to him was to wear an outfit that matched his mother’s.</p>
<p>Usually, only his father and the grandmas who helped with cooking at home saw their matching outfits. They’d seen it so often that they no longer said it was cute, nor that he took after his mother in appearance; even when they were wearing the same outfit!</p>
<p>But if he went out, there would be other people who’d see it. They’d see he was his mommy’s baby!</p>
<p>While he was talking, Ni Yi walked over with a gentle smile and showed his thoughtful young master the black dress on his phone. “This is it.”</p>
<p>Little Bun was even more delighted when he saw it. It was a simple, pure black dress. He also had black clothes! Just last week, Mommy had bought him a new black T-shirt.</p>
<p>The perfect matching outfit! He could wear it at the premiere with Mommy!</p>
