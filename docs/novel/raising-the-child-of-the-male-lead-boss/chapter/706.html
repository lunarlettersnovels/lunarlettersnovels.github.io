            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 45 – Daddy’s A Bad Actor</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao momentarily broke down while eating a delicious steak. And this made Shen Yichong think that this woman’s aptitude to ask for large sums of cash has broken through again.</p>
<p>Maybe if she worked harder and starred in a blockbuster movie, he wouldn’t think of it as big deal.</p>
<p>However, she only constantly fools around while shamelessly asking for money!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’ eyebrows twisted. He wiped the sauce smeared on the little face of the steamed bun who had his mouth opened in a daze and looked up towards Yu Yaoyao, briskly asking, “How much do you want?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao paused, “What?”</p>
<p>“For this month’s pocket money,” he shot back icily.</p>
<p>“You did well on the set today,” then he added, “It’s rare that you would act like this.”</p>
<p>This was the first time he had heard from her own mouth the impossible words that she missed him and her son. If he hadn’t known her so well in these past five years, he would have believed it easily.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s charming and elegant face which was white as snow frowned. Her voice was full of confusion and hesitancy as she questioned, “What does this have to do with pocket money? Isn’t it just a reward?”</p>
<p>She is a reasonable person; she won’t dare ask for anything not unless she deserved it.</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth sank, and he glanced at his son, who was eating happily, before raising his eyes back towards her.</p>
<p>His eyes were especially daunting as he sarcastically said, “When you were on set—what you specially said to me. Don’t you remember? Weren’t you doing it for your five million?”</p>
<p>And now, she is crying for no reason at all while eating dinner—isn’t this a blatant scheme to catch his attention and ask for money secretly?</p>
<p>It’s not like this hasn’t happened before. Back then, when she wasn’t satisfied, forget if her cried reached all the corners of the earth and towards the heavens—she won’t cry until she sees the money!</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao was only dumbfounded at the reason for his iciness.</p>
<p>She swallowed her saliva, sensing the danger in the air and her eyes were opened wide, looking at Shen Yichong as she asked disbelievingly, “You…are going to give me five million? Just because I said on set that <em>I miss you</em>?”</p>
<p>With a bang, Shen Yichong smashed his fork on the table in mortification!</p>
<p>His iciness was at its peak, and his face was several shades darker.</p>
<p>The steamed bun Shen Rui instantly jerked up at this sudden outburst, a grain of rice still stuck on the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with you?” Yu Yaoyao immediately became incensed.</p>
<p>She only said that she missed him, and now he is acting like this?</p>
<p><em>Is this man actually a masochist inside? Will it actually make him happy if I did the opposite? Wait, does he want that?</em></p>
<p>This man is harder to please than her ancestors!</p>
<p>“M-mom and dad…mom…y-you, don’t-quarrel.” The steamed bun, who was sitting to the side, trembled so much as unstoppable tears gushed from his eyes.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao glared at the unreasonable man before her and immediately hugged the steamed bun brushing the golden beans from his cheeks, and quickly comforted the little guy by packing him on the back soothingly.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid, my baby. We’re not fighting.”</p>
<p>She explained with a smile, “Mommy is an actress. And this is mommy’s line on the audition for her next play. You fell asleep in the car, so mommy was not able to tell you. Naturally, mom asked dad to help mommy practice her lines.”</p>
<p>As soon as the steamed bun heard this, he was stunned, and he immediately looked up at Yu Yaoyao’s smiling face.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s smile intensified into a brilliant sunflower. “It’s dad’s fault he scared the baby. His lines were so hard that he threw the fork and surprised the baby…but this was only because dad is a bad actor and forgot his lines.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun looked back at Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Faced at this imploring gaze, Shen Yichong dropped his gaze and remained silent for a moment.</p>
<p>“Yes, dad only forgot his words.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun finally breathed a sigh of relief and smiled, “Dad has to practice more.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao laughed and joked, “Baby, dad is not an actor. Just let him off the hook for now.”</p>
<p>On the other side of the table, Shen Yichong fixed her with a complicated look.</p>
