            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 71 – Green Tea or White Lotus (1)</strong></p>
<p>After taking a relaxing bath, Yu Yao took off her daytime clothes and slept happily. The first thing when she woke up the next day, was to check her Weibo followers. Upon seeing the new amount, she sat up in surprise from the bed. Her followers had risen from 130,000 to 210,000. In just one night, it had jumped by 80,000!</p>
<p>“Little Yiyi, today I also want to take the first place! No, every day from now onwards!” On their way to the TV station, Yu Yaoyao was full of fighting spirit, an unprecedented passion and motivation almost burst from out of her.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was also smiling from ear to ear, “Well, your votes also have been rising all night. Although, it can’t be help that there are some haters, having traffic, bad or good, is the first step towards successful stardom. Later on, we will prove to everyone our strength.”</p>
<p>In addition to gaining new fans, there are also netizens on the Internet who pointed out that she acted too much in this scene and she ate potato chips in an exaggerating fashion that it was simply too unrealistic. Other negative comments included she is fake, only acting pretentious and will naturally win because she has a golden thigh; there were different kinds of dog-abuse they sprinkled at her.</p>
<p>But fortunately, despite her mixed reputation, her popularity is actually rising.</p>
<p>“Today we don’t need to use props from Lay’s, we will get a good place in the ranking and slap these guys in their faces!” he declared confidently. “Elder sister, fighting!” As he cheered, he flipped open his laptop, intending to review the mechanics for today’s acting performance.</p>
<p>“According to the previous schedule, there are only 68 people left for today’s recording. At the beginning of the second match, there will be live audience voting with the judges.”</p>
<p>He turned to Yu Yaoyao, “Elder sister, although a live performance can be nerve-wracking, you don’t have to panic. You can take the audience as part of the background board, okay?” he softly said, as he watched Yu Yaoyao reapply her lipstick through a mirror.</p>
<p>After they arrived, her second appearance in the program still blinded a bunch of photographers. Before she had went out, the steamed bun had urged her to put on a thick cotton coat to keep herself warm.</p>
<p>However, the loose, bright purple sequined dress paired inside, didn’t make her look bloated and tacky at all. On the contrary, it set off her slender and petite physique; her hair was wounded up to a topknot bun and she wore knee-high, linen boots to complete the look.</p>
<p>It was as if she just came out of another show and brought forth her own aura.</p>
<p>After politely asking the photographers, Yu Yao entered the set.</p>
<p>“Zheng elder brother.”</p>
<p>After she saw yesterday’s highlight film, she couldn’t help but beam in from of the photographer before her who had made it all possible. Also, she wanted to repay his kindness for giving her his egg and flower soup yesterday.</p>
<p>“Here’s a little pudding for you. It’s delicious.”</p>
<p>She brought it out of the house in the morning, feeling that good things should be shared with people who also acted nice with her. The sincere elder brother photographer blushed and hurriedly thanked her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao then quickly followed Ni Yi to where the assistant director was to listen carefully to the rules of today’s competition.</p>
<p>“At 9: 00 a.m., the filming for the second performance will officially start. For this part, the rule is very simple. You choose your own props in order of ranking. We have developed different performance topics for each prop, with each person having 15 minutes to prepare their scene,” the assistant director explained.</p>
<p>“Is there anything else?”</p>
<p>“Director,” Meng Xinran suddenly raised her hand and asked, “Do the top players take precedence in choosing the props?”</p>
<p>She silently glanced at Yu Yaoyao standing beside her and the fist hidden inside her overcoat shook in anger.</p>
<p>“I object to this!” She then proceeded to fervently explain, “This rule is unfriendly to newcomers. Yesterday, many of these new entrants who were actually capable, came in last just because of insufficient traffic. I believe they should be given a fair chance to fight back in this round.”</p>
<p>Many people at the scene looked at her. Some were full of gratitude, others were surprised, and the rest remained silent. Ni Yi, who was standing in the back row, and had a beaming expression, was suddenly stunned on the spot. In the next second, Meng Xinran stood up and smiled her signature sweet, humble smile at all the contestants in the room and the staff. “I am willing to give up the preferential treatment for the top-ranking players and opt to make a choice as the last contestant.”</p>
<p>Comments immediately erupted from a few of the contestants.</p>
<p>“Sister Ran!”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you being too kind?!”</p>
<p>“Sister Ran, thank you!”</p>
<p>Many small newcomers at the end of the crane and on the verge of elimination thanked her profusely.</p>
<p>But Meng Xinran merely shook her head in reply. “This is nothing. Everyone started as an amateur artist in this industry; I know all of your sufferings. With no background and no supporter, it was up to me to pave a road for myself—I had to seize every opportunity desperately.”</p>
<p>She smiled when she said this and with eyes like a good girl next door, they landed on Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, wouldn’t you say so?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi stared in an instant.</p>
<p><em>F*ck! Is this a green tea or white lotus b*tch?!</em></p>
