            <p><strong>Chapter 495</strong></p>
<p>“Actually, Sister Yaoyao has changed a lot in the past few years. She has become more beautiful and smart,” Ni Yi said.</p>
<p>He usually wouldn’t share much. As a manager to a star, a sense of privacy and trust must be established. However, this kind of professionalism held him back for so long. Besides Chen Lin, who was in a similar job as him, he couldn’t communicate with his other friends and relatives about work, else he unconsciously spilled small, insider secrets.</p>
<p>Therefore, he usually didn’t have anyone he could chat with. When talking to people in his circle, Ni Yi was also tight-lipped about Yu Yaoyao’s affairs. At most, he would only talk about the scope of work. He had to be careful with everyone, so as not to let Sister Yao become a trending topic again. While it was quite difficult, he still must at least be tight-lipped.</p>
<p>But Ni Yi really wanted to share Sister Yao’s brilliance with other people!</p>
<p>There was no one to share with on how proud he felt when he saw her get better, as well as the love in the air he witnessed between the family every day. He was already bored to share those with Chen Lin.</p>
<p>But Director Li was different. First, he was an insider. Second, he was a director who once looked down on Sister Yao but now admired her. Third, he could be considered as Guangxin’s person. Fourth, everyone was now on the same boat. They worked hard for the film and had the same interests. Director Li was usually very low-key on the Internet and had a good character.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was excited. After sifting through his mind of what he could say, he opened the floodgates.</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk nonsense. Other than my Sister Yao, there’s no other female artist that are as good-looking and also good-natured as her in the industry. Mr. Shen’s attitude towards Sister Yao has naturally become more intimate than before. When Guangxin was in crisis, it was Sister Yao who stayed by his side and never gave up.”</p>
<p>As Ni Yi described, Director Li secretly noted everything he said in his heart. <em>‘Of course, the hero and heroine should go through hardships together. When the hero almost loses everything, the heroine should be there to laugh with him despite the situation and stay by his side,’ </em>he thought amicably. His eyes lit up. “Then does Xiaoyu usually have a soft personality when she’s with Mr. Shen? Does she act like a delicate woman?” he asked.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, whose stubborn personality made her fight with the directors, had slammed herself into Mr. Shen’s arms like a frightened little deer at the film set last time!</p>
<p>“Uh…” Ni Yi touched the back of his head, thinking. “I haven’t seen it either. But it seems like that in the variety shows. She needed Mr. Shen to carry her when she gets up. All the audience should know,” he said. “When Sister Yao acts like a spoiled child, no man can handle her… only Mr. Shen can endure her childish antics.”</p>
<p>Director Li nodded, thinking: <em>‘Okay, for the sweet ending, the male protagonist should carry the female protagonist out of bed! No matter how strong she was outside, she was soft at home!’ </em>Then, he said, <em> </em>“As expected, does she act differently when she’s home and when she’s out?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi laughed, reminiscing. “Haha! Yes, she is like that. When she’s out, she must look bright and beautiful. Her photos must be taken at the right angles, and she’s very particular about where the light hit her face in the photo. She’s just like a little princess outside. However, she always acts squeamish at home.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Director Li inched a bit closer.</p>
<p>“Her mantra is ‘Nawwww’,” Ni Yi said.</p>
<p>“Oh, I think I know that.”</p>
<p>There seemed to be such a gap with her home life and variety shows. Director Li nodded again. Recorded!</p>
<p>“Sister Yao is also like a little hamster. There are so many snacks at home. You can’t even finish it by winter, let alone by a few years!” Ni Yi prattled on, “When she gets home, she would lay on the sofa and said that she’s so tired and needed a massage from Mr. Shen…”</p>
<p>Director Li widened his eyes.<em> ‘Okay, recorded!’ </em>The switch between the external and internal personalities was novel! Yu Yaoyao, as the topic of the interview, did not disappoint Director Li.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When they ate together that day, Yu Yaoyao directly pressed Shen Yichong on the dining table. She pinched his chin, and said,</p>
<p>“Woman, what have you done to me? Do you know you’re playing with fire?!”</p>
<p>“Do you think this trick will work for me!?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be naive! If you want me to save your father, take off your clothes and lie down on the bed!”</p>
<p>She said the lines and shook Shen Yichong’s chin away. Then, she turned around and looked at Director Li. “How was it, Director? My performance just now was about my soul being occupied by the domineering rich man. Was it okay?” she began. “Do you need me to press him on the wall?”</p>
<p>Her face was full of anticipation.  For today’s show, she watched a domineering man just to get into acting mode. She was completely in the role!</p>
<p>Director Li, who had been interviewing Ni Yi and Chen Lin these past few days, thought he already knew the couple very well. At this moment, he still got completely petrified nonetheless!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, on the other hand, lifted Yu Yaoyao’s hands and loomed closer to her on the chair. “I told you to read the script, and this was all you saw?!” he thundered.</p>
<p>“What?! Darling, how can you call it ‘this’?” Yu Yaoyao wailed in response, instantly holding her chest. “Don’t you remember what you said to me back then? You obviously… Nawww, it’s you who is going too far~”</p>
<p>In an instant, she switched to the female lead. It was all in one take, without any sign of awkwardness.</p>
