            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 268 – I Found You (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong stood there without budging, unwilling to move his feet but he was still pulled by his hands and dragged away step by another step. This effectively wasted precious time of the program and the staff.</p>
<p>Director Zhao, once again, felt utterly defeated and frustrated by this couple. The two staff that he had instructed to move Shen Yichong couldn’t even drag him a few meters. Director Zhao regretted allowing Shen Yichong to stay back to observe his wife. He had fallen for their schemes again!</p>
<p>Director Zhao heaved a weary sigh. “Mr. Shen, if you don’t cooperate, I will have to cut down on the expenses that we give your wife and son for the duration of the broadcast,” he said resignedly, “That might make Yu Yaoyao cry for not being able to get her hands on some good food, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>The unyielding Shen Yichong suddenly hesitated. “Your family’s progress in this game has been remarkably fast, Mr. Shen,” added Director Zhao, “Please don’t sabotage it now and make things difficult for your wife.” Zhao Yu walked to the door. Shen Yichong hesitated for a moment longer and swiftly followed the Director outside.</p>
<p>This incidence wasn’t lost on the audience who had been following the broadcast very attentively. As expected, the comment section saw many frustrated viewers siding with Shen Yichong:</p>
<p><strong>【It feels like the Cowherd and Weaver Girl* have been separated by the Queen Mother! How cruel!! 】</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>*Cowherd and Weaver Girl is a romantic Chinese folk tale about two star-crossed lovers. You can read more about it here: </strong></em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cowherd_and_the_Weaver_Girl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><u><em><strong>The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl – Wikipedia</strong></em></u></a></p>
<p><strong>【My sister and Mr. Shen are so ceaselessly working to be with each other! And the director is unmoved and still wants to separate them? If I may ask, is the director the devil incarnate?!】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【No, I can’t do this. I want to strangle the director. Is he Fa Hai*? Mr. Shen, don’t listen to him. Go back and find my sister! 】</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>*Fa Hai is the villainous Buddhist monk from the Chinese legend Madame White Snake.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>【I’m moved. My sister could overcome her fear and disgust for the sake of her husband and retrieve the key! Mr. Shen was willing to take back his words and be a villain for his wife. But in the end, for his wife to eat good food, all his efforts were in vain! Really…. I’m going to cry. 】</strong></p>
<p>As Shen Yichong’s heavy steps followed the director to another location, the camera redirected to Yu Yaoyao who still had one other mini task to complete. She needed to take the stone out of the water bottle. The stone that was inside the bottle was somehow larger than the bottle’s opening. This was going to be difficult.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at it for a moment and walked to Ni Yi. She found a nail clipper in one of his pockets and took it. The staff had not mentioned any rules against using such things. So, she took the bottle and cut the bottle open, spilling the water and taking out the stone.</p>
<p>The staff were stunned. “You are not abiding by the—,” the staff said.</p>
<p>“You didn’t mention any specific restrictions,” interrupted Yu Yaoyao, “I have completed the level. Next task!” Yu Yaoyao recalled that she only needed to finish two tasks in order to proceed to the next level. “Oh right! I only needed to pass two tasks. Please give me the hint to the next level,” she said.</p>
<p>The staff was unsure, but Yu Yaoyao snatched the cue card from his hands before he could refuse. “Please head to the Boat-Rowing Area,” Yu Yaoyao read the next hint on the cue card.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Yu Yaoyao, took Shen Rui, and promptly left the museum.</p>
<p>The staff ran to stop her. “You have broken the rule,” he said, “There will be consequences. Your expenses will be cut off.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t break any rules,” said Yu Yaoyao firmly, “You didn’t mention any rule at all. I can complete the last task if you want.” She continued, “Praying Mantis, Long-horned Beetle, Caterpillar, Lacewing Stink Bug, Locust, Grasshopper, Moth, Ladybug. That’s all. I have categorized them all.”</p>
<p>The staff who was trying to stop her, hesitated. He looked at the correct answer that was written on a card in his hand and was amazed to find that everything that Yu Yaoyao had mentioned was correct. Even if she had broken the rule for the second task, she had completed the third task successfully. The staff looked up from his card to find that Yu Yaoyao had already disappeared with Shen Rui. Everyone there had a look of admiration and respect for the contestant.</p>
<p>The cameraman had run out along with Yu Yaoyao to get everything on camera. The livestream showed a hurrying Yu Yaoyao with Shen Rui in her arms towards the Boat-Rowing Area. Running wasn’t Yu Yaoyao’s strong point, so the cameraman quickly caught up with her. She gasped for air and slowed down.</p>
<p>Shen Rui on her back was cheering her on. “Mommy is the best and the smartest. Go mommy!” his little voice cried. But Yu Yaoyao was trying her best, and running with a child on her back was exhausting. The viewers saw this and devised a plan by themselves, discussing it on the comments section:</p>
<p><strong>【I want to fly through the screen had hold Mr. Shen down for you! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【That’s right! The comment above reminds me! Is there anyone near the filming area? Raise your hands!!!】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【City B’s Cruise Area in the Riverside Park! Calling all YY fans, and Yaoyao couple fans nearby! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Oh my, if you didn’t say anything I would have forgotten. I live nearby! I’ll go tie up the director and give him to Y! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Now that you say this, my school seems to be pretty close to that area, five minutes away maybe. 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Comrades, see you all in the Cruise Area. Even if we can’t kidnap Mr. Shen, we still need to block them, and stop them from going to the next area! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Count me in! I’ll be there in half an hour! Hold on! 】</strong></p>
