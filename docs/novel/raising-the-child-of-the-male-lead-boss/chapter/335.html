            <p><strong>Chapter 428</strong></p>
<p>Little Bun was super active. He even moved the small bench in the garden to sit on the side of his mommy’s recliner. Then, he started whispering to her belly while sliding the tablet.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pinched his eyebrows. He felt his temples twitching. “Buy all of them if you don’t know what color she likes. Since the baby’s clothes are small, they won’t take up space.”</p>
<p>Since he was rich, he was not afraid of spending money.</p>
<p>However, Little Bun Shen Rui totally disagreed, “Daddy, little sister has the right to choose~”</p>
<p>He quickly put his head close to the belly after speaking. After a second, he looked at Shen Yichong in frustration. “It’s all daddy’s fault. I missed what my sister said just now~”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, “…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao laughed out loud.</p>
<p>At night, she sent Little Bun back to his room and coaxed him to sleep. Then, she returned to her bedroom and took the initiative to confess her mistake with Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Darling, I know I was wrong. I’ve had too much fun playing with our son,” she said. “I know that you’re worried that he’ll learn some bad things and will be affected negatively, but he‘s just over five years old and should still be enjoying the joy of childhood. We can’t deprive him prematurely. Besides, he actually knows that it’s because his younger sister has grown up, and there is not much room for her to move around frequently.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao held Shen Yichong’s arm and shook it coquettishly.</p>
<p>“But he was very worried. A few days ago, he kept asking if his younger sister would feel uncomfortable living in my stomach. He said she can’t stretch her legs and flip around… He was too worried and that would be bad for his development, which is why I told him the signal is not good.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong placed his arms around her waist and rubbed her back muscles, “Okay.”</p>
<p>He touched her head, “Then we’ll do what you like. Rest early.” He had no qualms when it came to following what his wife spoke.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Shen was not much better than Little Bun at night. After putting Yu Yaoyao in bed, he would start talking to her belly just like what Little Bun did in the day. After telling her stories, he would play some light music for her. Then, he would ask her if she was happy today…</p>
<p>He was just…the enlarged version of Shen Rui.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wanted to laugh but she held back. She could only cover the corners of her mouth and let the father and son play with the baby cheerfully, as long as they were happy.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the day of the Hundred Flowers Awards Ceremony, Ye Yun would call on the YY fans to watch the live broadcast of the awards together whenever she had free time. It was already confirmed that Yaoyao will not attend. Counting the days, she was almost due.</p>
<p>But this did not hinder the high enthusiasm of this group of determined fans to watch the show. This was Yu Yaoyao’s first nomination, and it was likely to be her first award. As witnesses along the way, the loyal fans were very excited. They all stood in front of the computer screen on time.</p>
<p>All the artists who walked on the red carpet were all dressed up. They soon saw the directors and actors of the ‘Chaos’ crew entering the stage one after another. When Director Zhou walked across the red carpet and was about to write on the signature wall, he was intercepted by the host. The host interviewed and asked him if he was confident about winning the award. ‘Chaos’ was also nominated for the Best Director Award.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure about the others, but I am full of confidence in the actors in my play. They’re all excellent in playing the roles. I am very grateful to them.”</p>
<p>He finished speaking very politely and replied to the host’s question without giving a direct answer. Then, he took out a round red piece of paper from his pocket.</p>
<p>The host was a little surprised, “Director Zhou, may I ask what this is…?” Halfway through speaking, he found that Director Zhou had torn a corner of the red paper.</p>
<p>Director Zhou turned around and pasted the red piece of paper on the dense signature wall. The host finally realized what it meant after he took a closer look. At the same time, the photographer also turned the camera around. The audience in the live broadcast room could finally see it clearly.</p>
<p>The character ‘Yap’ could be seen vaguely among the handwriting that was like a ghost drawing talisman.</p>
<p>Everyone was excited, especially the YY fans.</p>
<p><em>[No way. Don’t tell me this is our Yaoyao’s signature?! This…hahaha!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao is determined to leave her signature on the wall although she can’t come? Sorry, I laughed so loudly!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Here we go again hahaha!]</em></p>
<p>Director Zhou also smiled towards the camera, as if he was talking to someone through a live broadcast.</p>
<p>“I got you here. Don’t worry!” he beamed. “Our ‘Chaos’ crew is a big family. No one will be left out.”</p>
<p>One sentence from him made all the YY fans very moved. In the comments, they all thanked Director Zhou for taking care of Yaoyao.</p>
<p>And soon, the ‘Chaos’ team entered the venue after they signed and took photos. The next group that entered the red-carpet area was the crew of the art film ‘Year’. The male and female starring actors, Cai Fang and Lu Cheng entered while waving to the media reporters on both sides with a smile. The low-key director Qi Hang also gently held the hand of the screenwriter Liu, who was wearing a cheongsam today. They led the entrance of Wei Ming and other supporting actors.</p>
<p>Walking to the signing area, the host greeted them as usual and asked some standard questions. Director Qi Hang was distracted all of a sudden and didn’t hear it. But he did an action that the audience felt familiar with. He took out a familiar little red post from his pocket. He tore off the sticker and stuck it on the signature wall.</p>
<p>The host was stunned. But the audience in the live broadcast room who had seen the picture clearly were laughing.</p>
<p><em>[Is Yaoyao the only artist who left two signatures on the autograph wall?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao: Double protection. What if one director forgets about me? What if the sticker is not sticky enough?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen: My wife cannot come, but if she wants to sign, I must satisfy her.]</em></p>
<p><em>[How did our sister make the award ceremony so funny hahaha!]</em></p>
