            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 103 – Under a Spell</strong></p>
<p>However, before Meng Xinran could burst inside, Yu Yaoyao took a step forward to stop her.</p>
<p>“Whether a man is inside my room or not, what does it have to do with you?”</p>
<p>She was no fool–with just one look with Meng Xinran who was in front of her, she instantly understood the situation. All previous rumors that besieged her, probably came from this little flower.</p>
<p><em>Did you come here to see a show?</em></p>
<p>Unbelievable. This little flower is not that simple, and Yu Yaoyao has sorely underestimated her shamelessness.</p>
<p>“Miss Meng, I don’t seem to know you very well. You’d better not step inside my room—it’s basic courtesy.” Yu Yaoyao added with an enchanting smile. “After all, I have a lot of valuable things inside. If I somehow were to lose them, don’t blame me for what comes out of my mouth.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s face changed.</p>
<p>Having enough, Yu Yaoyao walked back to the small sofa she had just sat before and picked up the unfinished instant noodles.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, are you hiding something?” Meng Xinran’s eyes flashed as she clenched her fists.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao forked some of the steaming noodles and blew on it, before taking a mouthful. Afterward, she smiled and replied, “Don’t talk nonsense, otherwise–” her former gentle eyes suddenly become icy, replaced by a murderous look!</p>
<p>“… You will have to bear the consequences.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s footsteps halted, her face turning white. But then she immediately smiled.</p>
<p><em>Guilty people will act spontaneously, and sport unnatural expressions. Moreover, they’ll deliberately make a ruckus…</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s current behavior hit the nail.</p>
<p>So Meng Xinran quickly looked into the room and took a step forward. With just two steps in, she was able to see the left side of the room, where a beautiful black cap rested on top of a tea table.</p>
<p>“Ah, this hat looks familiar! I believe I just saw it recently in some photos.” Meng Xinran’s eyes were brighter than the sun as she moved forward to pick it up.</p>
<p>The owner of this hat is the same man she was looking for. It was this brand of cap the man photographed together with Yu Yaoyao in the love hotel wore. As if afraid Yu Yaoyao would destroy the evidence, she clutched the hat material tightly in her hand.</p>
<p>“What brand is this? Isn’t this quite luxurious… oh, look, there’s even a logo on it.”</p>
<p>A spectator standing at the door suddenly recognized it, and his face suddenly changed. “Isn’t that the same cap from the photos that trended this afternoon?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I remember this is an expensive brand that sells merchandise for thousands of dollars!”</p>
<p>The deputy director who was going to leave immediately turned pale, but soon, he made a gesture to a female crew nearby and approached Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, there’s something we need to discuss. Others will leave first; this ma’am to the side will guide you out.”</p>
<p>To give Yu Yaoyao face, they had to evacuate the premises of witnesses. After all, if somehow a man would be found in her room, her reputation will take a significant hit! It will be an embarrassment to the show and will paint a bad name to the crew, which had let this happen under their noses.</p>
<p>But everyone was stubborn; they wanted to stay and watch. Meng Xinran, in particular, couldn’t wait to see where the man was hiding. Yu Yaoyao was a particular beauty, even when she was only eating noodles, but she knew that man was beyond ugly.</p>
<p>“On the count of three, you’d better put that cap down.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran released a loud laugh; she couldn’t help it any longer. She felt Yu Yaoyao was so brain-dead for struggling even when her downfall is imminent.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, I remember this too!” She showed her mobile phone directly in front of Yu Yaoyao. “It’s from that infamous photo of you kissing <em>this man</em> inside the hotel. They both have the same brand and style of hat!”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran always had a sweet face in place. However, at the moment, her expression was twisted that of pure victory.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, where are you hiding him? You should speak up, time is of the essence. That way, we can help you hide him and think of ways to explain the matter to the public.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she covered her mouth as another smile threatened to break out. “If a scandal happens in the program, what do you think the directors will do?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao glanced sideways at Meng Xinran, who was grinning. Her eyebrows couldn’t help but rise. “I heard that you’re known for your cute and kind demeanor.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran was about to answer, but Yu Yaoyao turned her head to the side and gagged, patting her chest. “What a despicable aura! It makes me pity my husband for being blind! To have a disgusting flower like you under Guangxin entertainment–it’s beyond repulsive!”</p>
