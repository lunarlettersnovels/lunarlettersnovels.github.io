            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 2 – She Wants to Counterattack (2)</strong></p>
<p>In the end, she would sell-out her personal love letters to the film emperor for her own amusement.</p>
<p>In a fit of anger, the male lead, who was her husband, had kicked Yu Yaoyao out of the house, after which he fell in love with the book’s heroine, spoiling her to the extreme.</p>
<p>“Sister, don’t you want to send that love letter? Haven’t you ever considered divorce in this lifetime? Think about it, one day you’ll be able to restore your freedom and pursue your happiness with Brother Chen Jiao again.”</p>
<p><i>For the pursuit of death, is that reason good enough? </i>Yu Yaoyao sneered.</p>
<p>In the book, two years after she almost committed suicide, Yu Yaoyao was finally able to understand that Yu Xinjie’s help was all fake. And in reality, only wanted to destroy her, rob her first love, pair her husband and the female lead, and finally win the friendship of the female lead.</p>
<p>When she wanted to retaliate, she had been hit by a car and turned into a vegetable.</p>
<p>Later, Yu Xinjie took it as an outlet to vent her frustrations. When she was in a bad mood, she would humiliate her by slapping her face and splashing it with water in the hospital.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want me to send your love letters?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao listened and almost guffawed. <i>I’m afraid this can’t be called for amusement anymore. Yu Xinjie’s morals are the worst! A snake is even better!</i></p>
<p>There was a sharp intake of breath at the other end of the phone. “Sister, haven’t you taken some of the pills yet? Are you still conscious? Don’t you remember? I helped you visit Elder Brother Chen’s class before, and even gave you those hand-made lunches and chocolate you had given to him!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed. There was no doubt about it now; she’d truly transmigrated.</p>
<p>“I’ll take the medicine now.”</p>
<p>With a sneer and a wave of her hand, she swept all the bottles into the trash can.</p>
<p>She would not be as foolish as the original owner to commit suicide at this clear deception!</p>
<p>On the other end of the phone, when Yu Xinjie heard the sound of the pills, she was relieved. “Sister, when you wake up, remember to cry first and ask for money! If Brother-in-law disagrees, you just say you’ll divorce him! Fight and don’t give up for the sake of Elder Brother Chen Jiao.”</p>
<p><i>Tsk, tsk. What a vicious person!</i></p>
<p>She didn’t stop her from having children just so she could be scorned by the public for not being a loving mother! The main highlight was that the original owner and she would lose her financial ties with the male lead if she didn’t have a child. And even later, she neglected the child, who died in a car accident due to the negligence of the nanny after she left.</p>
<p>“I see.” Yu Yaoyao didn’t bother to talk anymore and dropped the call abruptly.</p>
<p>She opened the camera app on her cell phone to take a picture of her face in order to look at it. In the image, she saw a beautiful woman with an innocent, delicate face framed with soft eyebrows and kind eyes. Although her face was a little pale at this time, whenever she squinted slightly, her peach blossom eyes held a charming, pure light and glistened…</p>
<p><i>So this is her human form; this is how she actually looks.</i></p>
<p>“Karma’s a b*tch, you can rest assured with that!”</p>
<p>She was kept in the zoo for 170 years by the Demon World Law Enforcement. She experienced a long period of boredom and living on the cold ground. She was like a guinea pig to human onlookers with their curious pointing fingers. She was only able to eat five cents worth of food a day and had to go to the toilet without the privacy of a female snake.</p>
<p>Moreover, they also had their heads pressed, their fangs pulled out to take photos, and perform for human beings.</p>
<p>In the end, she was struck to death by lightning!</p>
<p>She had dreamed of being reborn as a human adult. Now she had finally changed her body–she had achieved it!</p>
<p>This time, she wanted to live a good life and change her fate.</p>
<p>According to the plot of the novel, she should not go down the divorce route and turn into an adulteress which would, in turn, make her lose everything, lying in a hospital bed all her life.</p>
<p>She wanted to realize her dreams when she was a snake: to become an international star with the largest fanbase, and to let all the people in the world indulge in her beauty!</p>
<p>“I will take back what you have lost and what you cannot have!”</p>
