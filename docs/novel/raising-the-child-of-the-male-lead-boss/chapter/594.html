            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 159 – Besotted Husband (1)</strong></p>
<p>Right now, the stern Shen Yichong, eyes downcast, was a sight to behold. That tenderness…the sweet smile was so out of the world that even the ever diligent Chen Lin almost forgot about the voting.</p>
<p><em>I’ve never seen such softness on the boss’ face!</em></p>
<p>Chen Lin walked towards his boss and stopped just two steps away. A furtive peek was all it took for him to find out that Boss Shen’s indulgent smile was courtesy the woman in a dazzling costume on his phone– his wife.</p>
<p>He was lost for words.</p>
<p><em>Boss, since when did you become so fond of your wife? He’s never done it before!</em></p>
<p>Soon, Chen Lin hastened back to the podium and quickly called out loud. “Boss, your vote…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong lifted his head and his handsome face that was a little warm, in a blink of an eye, turned stiff and cold– as if his smile right now was a fleeting mirage. All of a sudden, the entire meeting room returned to its suffocating and glacial atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the abrupt dip in temperature, Chen Lin involuntarily shivered. He was quick to gather himself though and resumed with the proceedings.</p>
<p>“Shareholders, who wished to withdraw the investment from the adaptation, please vote.”</p>
<p>The shareholders inside the room instantly felt the boss’ coldness and looked at each other. Even so, two major shareholders took the lead in raising their hands.</p>
<p>“I vote to withdraw.”</p>
<p>“I second the motion. Mr. Shen has never made a mistake when it comes to investment matters. I trust him.”</p>
<p>Once the two bigwigs had voted, the remaining stockholders felt even more pressured.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at the other stockholders, his slender fingers still holding his mobile phone, his thin lips tightly pressed and his cold aura became colder.</p>
<p>“Is my exposition not enough?”</p>
<p>The words that came out from the boss were too heavy, making the remaining shareholders raise their hands– they’d ended up agreeing to withdraw.</p>
<p>“I agree with President Shen!”</p>
<p>“I believe in President Shen’s vision!”</p>
<p>“I support divestment…”</p>
<p>After a while, “All votes have been passed,” Chen Lin announced on the spot.</p>
<p>At the unexpected turn of events, the investment department head, Xu Hong seemed to have been thrown under the bus. He went stiff and flushed in embarrassment.</p>
<p>And why not? After three years of working in this company, he’s been promoted to the head of the investment department. He felt valued and recognised. However, off late, several of the big investment plans he’d proposed to the boss were downright rejected. Moreover, the first few rejections had proved that the boss’ decisions were spot on.</p>
<p>But this time, ‘Allure’, a good proposal that he’d studied for a long time and which was the least risky of all investment plans he’d proposed was rejected as well. Xu Hong squeezed the documents in his hand, he felt utterly humiliated.</p>
<p>Once the meeting was wrapped, Shen Yichong stood up without looking at them and strode, like a meteor, towards the door.</p>
<p>Chen Lin, who was going over the minutes, looked up at the boss, quickly followed, almost failing to keep up with him. When Shen Yichong hurried to the door, everyone heard a sweet and delicate voice coming from his mobile phone.</p>
<p>“My husband, the director praised me today and we finally signed the contract!” she said, excitedly.</p>
<p>“I bought a cake to celebrate my success. I’ll wait for you and the little bun to come back and let’s eat the cake together!” She added.</p>
<p>The shareholders, who heard his wife, as well as Chen Lin, were astounded! Seeing the boss in such a rush just to go back to his wife was something out of the ordinary!</p>
<p>When he walked to the parking lot, Chen Lin opened the car door for the boss and saw him deep in thoughts as if he was being confronted by the greatest problem of the century. He’d never seen his boss so tangled up before, even in the most difficult predicament.</p>
<p>Chen Lin, who was a little curious, asked, “Boss, are you worried that our stock prices would fall after we pull out our investments?”</p>
<p>After graduating from college, he worked for two years and then became Shen Yichong’s special assistant, coordinating the progress of different projects from various departments of the company.</p>
<p>Although his work was trivial, he always followed his boss and received hands-on training on business and leadership skills from him every day. So, seeing the boss mulling over something, he couldn’t help but wonder what the boss was thinking.</p>
<p><em>Is it true that when you are vigorous before shareholders, you are still worried whether your decision is correct?</em></p>
<p>Chen Lin looked at Shen Yichong, who was now sitting in the back seat of the car, and saw him looking at his phone screen.</p>
<p>“What do you think women like aside from limited edition bags?”</p>
<p>Chen Lin’s mouth opened wide in shock.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed his temple and continued. “Aside from junk food?”</p>
<p>Chen Lin seemed to be dreaming, even so subconsciously responded. “Flower?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned slightly. He’d never sent flowers to Yu Yaoyao before. She used to only love stuff like expensive jewelry and limited edition bags.</p>
<p>Chen Lin looked at his boss’ subtle and dull expression, he felt staggered.</p>
<p><em>Did I say something wrong?</em> He was single at the moment but had been in love several times before.</p>
<p>“Even if the girl says no, she still loves the thought of receiving flowers.”</p>
<p>“So?” Shen Yichong raised his brow and fell back into deep thoughts.</p>
