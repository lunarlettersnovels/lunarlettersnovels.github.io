            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 1 – She Wants To Counterattack (1)</strong></p>
<p>Glorious thunder and lightning instantly dashed down as rain poured from the sky. Yu Yaoyao was awakened from her stupor by the violent wind and rain.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes somewhat confusedly, and in an instant was blinded with throbbing pain in her head.</p>
<p><i>Huh? Has my nest become softer?</i></p>
<p>Compared to the field with stones, twigs, and leaves piled up a few days ago, this quilt was fragrant and warm. She could not help but rub her chin on the soft material a few times, a satisfied smile appeared on her dainty lips.</p>
<p>She rubbed her sore eyes and tried to raise her head.</p>
<p>But as soon as her eyes opened midway, she saw a huge and gorgeous crystal chandelier against a snow-white backdrop. Surrounding her were European-styled, white furniture with gilded edges.</p>
<p><i>Gulp!</i> Yu Yaoyao swallowed, looking up and around slowly. <i>This was not her snake nest in the zoo!</i></p>
<p>A few years ago, she had secretly hidden in the snake house of a popular zoo. She spent her days playing on her mobile phone and was addicted to novels and TV dramas.</p>
<p>However, when she had gleaned the basic knowledge of the world, she was ready to slip out of the zoo to be the most beautiful star in the world. Just when she was ready to beautifully audition, she was suddenly struck by a thunderbolt by the damn Demon Law Enforcement and had died immediately!</p>
<p><i>I’m actually dead</i>… Her head ached whenever she thought, and a memory that did not belong to her constantly invaded her mind.</p>
<p><i>She’s reborn now—no, she transmigrated?</i></p>
<p>She’d transmigrated into a female with the same name as hers- Yu Yaoyao. This woman grew up being in love with the Film Emperor Chen Jiao, but in order to save her family from crisis, she’d painfully married the boss of an entertainment company.</p>
<p>Just now, she’d called her estranged husband to ask for money, which ultimately resulted in a heated argument. As soon as she had raised her head in frustration, she’d hit the bed and passed out.</p>
<p>While she was still sorting out the unexpected memories, the mobile phone on the bed suddenly rang.</p>
<p>The name ‘<i>Yu Xinjie</i>’ kept flashing.</p>
<p><i>A familiar name,</i> Yu Yaoyao thought as she peeked over and accepted the call.</p>
<p>From the other side came an urgent voice. “Sister, have you taken the sleeping pills? I had to place my trust in a few friends to buy enough in batches!”</p>
<p>“Sleeping pills?” Yu Yaoyao asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>She shifted her eyes to the bedside table, and sure enough, there were several bottles of medicine conspicuously scattered around.</p>
<p>“Sister, are you repenting?” Yu Xinjie asked and continued, “If you are to commit suicide, ask brother-in-law another five million this month! Don’t you care about mom and dad? Are you going to leave me alone? I’m about to pay for my tuition for the new year, and dad’s company is to invest in new projects.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was stunned. “Tuition?”</p>
<p><i>What a sister! So cold-hearted! </i></p>
<p><i>Wasn’t it obvious that she’s about to commit suicide… and to die just for her tuition?</i></p>
<p>“Sister, are you afraid? When brother-in-law comes back, he will definitely take you to the hospital. You won’t be able to commit suicide again! The moment you ask brother-in-law for five million dollars, I’ll send your love letter to Elder Brother Chen Jiao!”</p>
<p>On her last day before she took on a human form, she had read on her mobile phone the web novel: <i>Overbearing President Pampers Wife: Hello, Sweets!</i> In that, the miserable female lead was fooled by her sister, took sleeping pills, and lived a life where she was mostly only half alive.</p>
<p>This miserable girl had the same name as her, and that vicious sister was none other than Yu Xinjie.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie was an illegitimate daughter. After the death of Yu Yaoyao’s mother, she followed her mother who became the new mistress of the family and settled in the Yu residence. She pretended to cultivate ten years of sisterhood with Yu Yaoyao but actually wanted to take away everything from her.</p>
<p>First, she manipulated Yu Yaoyao to pursue her first love, the film emperor, and after her marriage, she coaxed her into committing suicide and coerced her to ask the male lead for money.</p>
