            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 267 – Memories of the Enclosure (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao saw the three game props. The most striking was the big, black box, which was as huge as a desk. It was covered by a black cloth under which there was a round opening. There was a bottle of water on a table beside the box.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao understood. She approached the box. Lao Zheng moved the camera closer to focus on the opening of the box. It had countless beetles crawling inside, and a key lay there right in the middle. To reach the key, Yu Yaoyao would have to extend her hand in at least till the forearms. The viewers were extremely nervous as they saw this:</p>
<p><strong>【Yaoyao looked scared when she walked in…What do we do?!】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【I would rather die than put my hand in a box full of insects!】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Oh no! This program team is so crazy…】</strong></p>
<p>The staff looked at Yu Yaoyao. “You can choose to skip the first game,” he said, “There are still two other mini games. If you pass them both, you can still get the hint to the next level.” Perhaps he had noticed Yu Yaoyao’s nervousness.</p>
<p>The image flickered and switched to the hidden room in the insect museum. Shen Yichong looked very tense. His calm demeanor was broken and the anxiety on his face was clear. He hadn’t looked this worried even when his company had faced a bankruptcy crisis scandal.</p>
<p>“Mommy…,” Shen Rui called. He looked at the staff. “Can I do it?” he asked. Seeing his mum nervous, he was willing to volunteer. His father had once caught a beetle for him. He had played with it and then eventually let it go. “I am not scared,” he added bravely.</p>
<p>“No, kid,” said the staff apologetically, “You can’t participate.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui looked at his mother with worry. However, Yu Yaoyao smiled at him and handed him to Ni Yi, who had been allowed to accompany them. “It’s alright, baby,” she said to him, “Will just be a moment.”</p>
<p>“Is there a time limit?” she asked the staff.</p>
<p>“No,” he replied, “You can take as long as you like.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded and thanked him. She then opened the hatch at the top of the box and rolled up her sleeves. She stretched her hand into the box without a moment of thought and tried to get the key. The camera shot a closeup of her hand in the box, fishing for the key.</p>
<p>The viewers were stunned. They had seen her fingers brush some of the creatures and were pouring their feelings in the comment section under the live broadcast:</p>
<p><strong>【This is so disgusting!】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Yaoyao is so brave!】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Mr. Shen did a great job staying back. 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【I admire Yaoyao’s courage!】</strong></p>
<p>The camera switched to Yu Yaoyao’s face. Yu Yaoyao raised her eyebrows slightly. But she was very calm. She took out the key and showed it to the staff. “Got it!” she said. It had taken less than a minute. The staff was stunned. “I thought you would have hidden it in the grass, which would have taken me a bit more time.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you afraid?” asked the staff, amazed.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at the staff, eyebrows raised. “I already told you,” she said, “I am not scared of insects. I could even catch them with bare hands if you like.”</p>
<p>Director Zhao heaved a sigh. He thought she had been nervous because of the insects, but he was wrong again. He never seemed to be able to figure her out. “Mr. Shen,” he said, “We need to leave.” Shen Yichong pretended like he hadn’t heard him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen,” called Director Zhao again, which was rewarded with no response. “Don’t pretend like you can’t hear me.” There was still no response.</p>
<p>Honestly, Director Zhao felt like he could let loose a scream of frustration but held back. “Chong, Lee!” he called his staff, “Help Mr. Shen to the next location. Drag him if you have to.”</p>
<p>“To our next spot!” declared Director Zhao, “The boat-rowing area.”</p>
