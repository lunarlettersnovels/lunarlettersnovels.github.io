            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 264 – My Blushing Husband (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>The viewers in the comment were in fits of laughter. Many joked about Yu Yaoyao’s fondness for food, in good faith:</p>
<p><strong>【Hahahaha, Mr. Shen knows Yaoyao too well! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【At the seafood counter just now, Yaoyao’s excited eyes were clearly saying, “I am going to eat at least seven to eight big lobsters!”】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【All the members of the program group shivered!】</strong></p>
<p>Director Zhao’s mouth twitched. “Let’s wait and see,” he said.</p>
<p>The taxi carrying Yu Yaoyao, Shen Rui, and the cameraman soon reached the river-side park. It was the largest park in the local area, named Binjiang Park. The park was enormous. There was a rough map of the park at the entrance which showed a few major areas such as the Children’s Area, Botanical Garden, BBQ Area, Boat-rowing, etc.</p>
<p>When they were at the entrance of the park, it was already about to close. However, it was clear that the park had been prepared for the program. Yu Yaoyao took Little Bun’s hand and walked in. “Mom, I don’t see any cameramen here,” he said uncertainly. He had thought that there would be other cameras around if his dad was actually here.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked around the park and frowned. She glanced at the turf on the ground and narrowed her eyes at the dirt trail made by trotting feet. “Seems like many people passed by from here,” she said, pointing at the dirt. The staff were stunned, seeing Yu Yaoyao so attentive to minor details.</p>
<p>Little Bun squatted down and looked at the trail. “You’re right, mommy,” he said happily, “There are so many footprints here.” The staff tried to direct their attention elsewhere. He said, “It may also be the footprints of tourists, many people come here to this park.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao ignored the staff. She turned to Shen Rui and discussed on the location to start looking. She suggested a backup plan as well. “Bun, what do we do if the person we find isn’t your father?” she asked, “What if it is someone from the other two family? Do we still save them?”</p>
<p>It seemed this was a great moral crisis for Little Bun’s little mind. He thought about it for a while, frowning, and finally decided on an answer. “Yes, mommy,” he said, looking at Yu Yaoyao, “We must still save him. His children must be waiting for him at home.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao agreed with Little Bun’s generosity. “Okay, then,” she said, taking Little Bun’s hand, “Let’s go!”</p>
<p>“But mommy,” said Little Bun, hesitating, “What if dad is waiting somewhere else for us? Who will save him?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao thought about it and looked at Little Bun. He looked sad, and she didn’t want to disappoint him. She snapped her fingers. “I know what to do!” she said, eagerly, “If we save someone else, we will unite with the other family and find dad. So, don’t you worry.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s unending scheming gave Director Zhao a headache. On the contrary, the live broadcast was accompanied by comments from happy viewers. Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui’s speculations were rewarded with confirmation as two staff rushed out quickly from the direction of the flowerbeds.</p>
<p>“Congratulations!” they declared, “You have successfully found the location where a certain ‘husband’ was kidnapped.” Director Zhao had instructed the staff to not reveal the location as her husband’s. He had intended to keep it vague, which could mean it might be a husband from any other family.</p>
<p>“There will be three recuse levels in this particular location,” the staff continued, “Each time you pass one, you get a hint to save the person who might or might not be your husband.” The staff took out the task card. “The first level is the Tacit Test. It is a Q&amp;A between the couple. You need to answer five questions in this level. If three of your answers are consistent with the answer written by your husband, you will have successfully cleared this level.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao noticed the effort the staff exerted to maintain the vagueness of this task. “Are these answers written by my husband?” she asked.</p>
<p>The staff nodded. “Yes,” he responded, “as it should be, in the Tacit Test.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s face lit up and she picked Shen Rui up in her arms. “It’s dad, mommy!” exclaimed Little Bun, “Dad is surely here.”</p>
<p>The staff had unknowingly given them the answer that they most sought. Why would the staff be holding a task card with another person’s answer on it when the Tacit Test was supposed to be between couples? Little Bun was screaming in joy, and Yu Yaoyao was confident that they would find Shen Yichong by dinner time.</p>
<p>Director Zhao looked at the screen, angry at the slip the staff had made. In the meantime, the staff ignored the cheering mother and son and continued with the level. “The first question,” one of them continued, “The time when you felt like you left a deep impression on your husband.”</p>
<p>The Tacit Q&amp;A was developed to showcase the couple’s knowledge about each other as well as to provide a glimpse of the private lives of the couple concerned. This held true as Yu Yaoyao’s fans and other viewers became excited as soon as the question was uttered:</p>
<p><strong>【It must be the first time they met for sure.】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Mr. Shen: I think my wife leaves deep impression on me every day】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Wedding day! Her wedding photo must be so stunning, but I couldn’t find it on the internet. 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【I am guessing it’s the time she was giving birth. I wonder if Mr. Shen accompanied her in the delivery room】</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaayoa’s fans would definitely love her answer. Everyone had already created many fantasies in their heads regarding this. A tender and shy voice interrupted these fancies as Yu Yaoyao uttered, “Naked.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blushed. She had covered Little Bun’s ears before she had answered. The staff were taken aback. Yu Yaoyao assumed that she had been too quiet, so she repeated her words. “Once when I hurt my hands, I was unable to take off my clothes by myself to take a bath,” she continued, blushing, “My husband helped me….” She trailed off.</p>
