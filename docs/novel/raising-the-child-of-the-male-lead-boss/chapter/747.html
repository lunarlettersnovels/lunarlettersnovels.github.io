            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 4 – Must Make Her Beautiful (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Your sister’s advice?” Shen Yichong narrowed his eyes dangerously.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s big eyes flickered expectantly, but soon two more big tears fell down.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p><i>A change in a second… She’s a drama queen! And to think she was almost gasping for breath while she was crying.</i></p>
<p>The corner of Shen Yichong’s mouth was almost hooked up and his face was full of cynicism. The moment he reached out, he threw Yu Yaoyao’s arms away from him, letting her whole-body crash onto the bed!</p>
<p>The ink-like eyes as if there was a storm brewing inside, looked as if they were also submerged in a night of lightning and thunder.</p>
<p>The cold voice, almost bland, was as sharp as a knife. “Just a few days ago in this room, you said that marrying me was the biggest mistake in your life and your biggest regret. Don’t you want to divorce me?” His dark eyes narrowed dangerously, making Yu Yaoyao tremble when she fell on the bed.</p>
<p>“Husband, I was confused at that time, and now I have figured it out!”</p>
<p>“What other tricks do you have up your sleeve?” Shen Yichong looked sarcastically at the still sobbing woman.</p>
<p>Her beautiful face and perfect swan neck, when seen by any other man, could shake his faith. But there was only a flicker of disgust in this man’s eyes.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao found that he did not have any trust in his eyes. Instead, he was fiercer and heavier; his heart was cold.</p>
<p>It seems that the male lead had completely lost patience and trust in the original owner.</p>
<p>The original owner liked the film emperor, so from her honeymoon, pregnancy to breastfeeding, she used to sleep in separate rooms from Shen Yichong on the pretext that she was not feeling well.</p>
<p>Later, they occasionally shared a room with each other. Every time they did it, she would show that she was in great pain and even shed tears. After this, Shen Yichong never wanted to touch her again.</p>
<p>To this day, they had become strangers.</p>
<p><i>This male lead is so pitiful. Having been married for many years and can’t even touch his wife. </i></p>
<p>It was mentioned in the book that although his wife was like this, he always kept himself clean and considered women outside dirty. Therefore, he never went outside to tumble with other females.</p>
<p><i>Dammit! This is almost five years of being a monk, almost as miserable as I!</i></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at him in a moment of sympathy.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was in a terrible mood. He was about to leave and drop a cruel remark.</p>
<p>“Keep your duty in mind, don’t push me—”</p>
<p>But before he could finish, Yu Yaoyao suddenly got up from the bed and grabbed his big hand to put it on her soft chest.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had been working in the business world for nearly ten years. He was serious and he had no fear of other people. But now, mid-sentence, when his cold palm touched a soft thing, the latter half of his remark directly turned to ashes.</p>
<p>It was as if he wanted to land a heavy blow but instead, his fist smashed into a mass of cotton; His strength was immediately exhausted.</p>
<p>His eyes became deep in an instant. “Are you testing my patience?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao is shriveled and thought to herself<i>, Isn’t this to make the monk earn even a little interest? Otherwise, it would be too pitiful…</i></p>
<p>Over the past few years, ever since she had moved to this new home, there was at least 20 to 30-million-yuan worth of money his wife moved to her maternal home. He had a son who couldn’t come home to enjoy a normal family, and his wife is useless.</p>
<p>Not even a touch, let alone <i>ooxx’s of</i> happiness.</p>
<p><i>Since </i><b><i>that</i></b><i> can’t be satisfied, he would naturally have a bad temper, ah! It’s best to have the ideal combination of yin and yang. No wonder that he spoiled the female lead so much in the book.</i></p>
<p>“Husband, it is all my fault.” Yu Yaoyao looked at him sincerely. “Now I know that you have only been kind and patient with me.”</p>
<p>She understood. After all, she knew this feeling.</p>
<p>She, herself, was deprived of liberty for more than 170 years. She took it to heart miserably. In reality, the two were subjected to the same misery!</p>
