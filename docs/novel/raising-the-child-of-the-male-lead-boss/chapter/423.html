            <p><strong>Chapter 340 – Eyes of A Beast (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Hu Yiwei was in great pain. He didn’t know how he could choose between them. He grabbed his last trace of reasoning and struggled on. There had to be some minor flaws that he could pick on!</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei shook his head rapidly, hoping that he himself could get his senses back. But as soon as he looked up, he was once again fascinated by Yu Yaoyao who had returned after getting changed.</p>
<p>She was wearing a dark green sequined mermaid dress that perfectly outlined her figure. Her charming eyes were outlined with fluorescent green eye shadow. She looked for all the world like a creature that lived in the perennial forest.</p>
<p>The next theme was the forest theme. The main colors were lush and light green, which were intended to express freedom and freshness.</p>
<p>They hadn’t even started, and she already looked like a living masterpiece!</p>
<p>“Let’s get started then. You can lie down here…” Hu Yiwei wanted to explain more, but only managed to say a few words.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes were pure, as if she were a naive child that was exploring a new world. She seemed to have discovered the lens again. Curiosity raised in her pure watery eyes, and she looked trapped between approaching or wanting to flee…</p>
<p>Such lingering eyes were perfect for storytelling. They made people can’t help but want to explore the aftertaste, and she inadvertently brought out the sense of sacredness that Hu Yiwei wanted the model to express.</p>
<p>He couldn’t even find the words to praise her. “Good. Ok!” His memory of his previous experience with her had been a kind of restraint.</p>
<p>She looked like she was born knowing what to do.</p>
<p>At least at this moment, she was like a creature that belonged in this forest. She didn’t need him to tell her to do any movement or posture. It seemed she was able to express freedom very naturally.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei reached out his hand and touched his face, grabbed his hair awkwardly, then excitedly pressed the shutter again and again. “Yes. Keep on going. Great!”</p>
<p>“Teacher Hu, it’s time to touch up her makeup…” the assistant reminded him again.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei was shocked. Had another hour really passed? He blushed so fiercely with embarrassment that it looked as though he had been severely beaten up.</p>
<p>“Um….Yu….Teacher…. Yu, one last one…” Hu Yiwei gritted his teeth. He called her with the title of ‘teacher’ in a light, awkward tone. But by now he was really convinced she deserved it.</p>
<p>Just when they were almost done, there was a commotion at the door of the studio.</p>
<p>The movements attracted Yu Yaoyao’s attention. The staff member who had been part of the commotion realized that none other than Chen Jiao, the winner of the best actor award, had arrived.</p>
<p>He was to appear on the big poster on the middle page of the next issue of ‘Beauty,’ and he had also happened to make an appointment for a shooting session today.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao smiled and greeted the staff as he walked in.</p>
<p>His eyes were full of charm, and he was as friendly as any brother next door was. No one could dislike him, and they were all unknowingly attracted to his handsome face and charming temperament.</p>
<p>However, Chen Jiao quickly discovered that everyone’s attention was not on him today. Following everyone’s line of sight, Chen Jiao arrived at the shooting area of ​​the forest theme. He couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw the barefooted elf-like girl with hair of seaweed. Her eyes were as clear and transparent as spring water, and they seemed to be reflecting the world flawlessly.</p>
<p>This felt all too familiar to him. Even just the slight hint of familiarity made his heart race.</p>
<p>“Brother Jiao, your dressing room is not here. Let’s go to Area B today,” his assistant softly called for him.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao seemed to have finally heard after the assistant had called him again. “Oh, okay,” Chen Jiao said.</p>
<p>A trace of panic suddenly flashed in his bright eyes. He was even walking funny when he turned to leave.</p>
<p>How could Yu Yaoyao have given him such a sense of familiarity?</p>
<p>Chen Jiao shook his head abruptly, trying to get rid of this strange thought. But his mind wound back to that little girl in her green and white elementary school uniform. During his darkest time, he had always pictured her smiling with her round, pure eyes looking at him…</p>
<p>She had asked in a soft voice, “What’s wrong, big brother… Why are you crying?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s body stiffened. His eyes turned involuntarily. He couldn’t help but look at the green figure in the jungle. At that moment, her smile overlapped with that of the little girl in his mind.</p>
<p>He violently kicked the trash can standing near the wall. But he froze immediately when he heard her speak.</p>
<p>“Thank you everyone for your hard work! I brought you all little cakes,” Yu Yaoyao’s soft, sweet voice rang clearly in his ears.</p>
<p>Then she smiled warmly at him and came forward.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s heart clenched, and all the blood in his body froze. “Yu…” he unconsciously stretched out his hands towards her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao came rushing towards him! And then went straight past.</p>
<p>“Good boy, my little baby! Have you been waiting for a long time? Mommy is off work, are your legs sore from waiting?” she cooed as she bent over and hugged the little boy standing near him.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao awkwardly lowered his hands.</p>
<p>“Mommy, my legs are not sore, how about you? Are you tired? Rui Rui will help you rub them!” Shen Rui said innocently.</p>
<p>“Wow, thank you my little boy!”</p>
<p>Mother and son hugged each other affectionately.</p>
<p>As Chen Jiao watched them, he felt like all his blood had stagnated in his veins.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao hugged her son, the little boy turned his head to reveal round eyes of the purest black. When he smiled, the corners of his eyes narrowed into small slits, making him look abnormally sweet.</p>
<p>The look, the temperament, it could only be…</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s face paled. He staggered backwards as he lost his balance.</p>
<p>It was said that a son would always take after his mother’s appearance…</p>
<p>“Brother Jiao, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Teacher Chen? Are you not feeling well?”</p>
