            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 135 – Queen of Advertisement (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Little Tao Tao…</em></p>
<p>“Sister-in-law…”</p>
<p>At the very least, he is the president of a renowned company. And behind him stands the marketing manager of his company! Shen Yichong’s eyebrows furrowed as he stood by in silence, his face that of his characteristic emotionless expression.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao didn’t feel there was a problem with her address. She could only wonder, <em>‘how many puddings does this man have in his home?!</em>’ Her slanted eyes showing her obvious envy and yearning.</p>
<p>“How much… pudding do you eat every day?” she asks timidly.</p>
<p>As president, he doesn’t have to spend money; it is essentially free of charge! Most of all, he can taste all the kinds of flavor available.</p>
<p>Li Tao’s eyebrows rose, bewildered. “Eat…?” He couldn’t help but glance towards Shen Yichong nearby for clarification.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong lips pressed to a thin line as he drags Yu Yaoyao back. “He doesn’t eat pudding; he has hated it ever since he was young.” Doing so, he also isolated Yaoyao from Li Tao’s outstretched hand.</p>
<p>“Wow.” Yu Yaoyao’s envy now shot even higher towards the sky.</p>
<p>Li Tao was currently taken aback by her appearance, his mind in disarray. It was not until, the makeup artist came to take Yu Yaoyao, that he woke from his stupor. He then asks Shen Yichong, his low voice conveying his astonishment.</p>
<p>“I thought sister-in-law was only playing in the program. You didn’t teach her?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong is known in the entertainment industry for his hawk eyes. In recent years, he has never lost money in his investments. He guided his wife to have a shy, cute persona, catering to the tastes of the public, and even took care of his business in some ways.</p>
<p>After watching the show, Li Tao had thought everything was insinuated by Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“No… she likes… your pudding,” Shen Yichong slowly says, holding down his throbbing temple.</p>
<p>To this day, he still can’t understand how she suddenly became <em>too</em> attached to food—explicitly showing great interest in junk food.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Li Tao was given a greater shock. “Oh my god! Such a fairy exists?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes flitted towards Li Tao, the latter’s thoughtful monologue being drilled into his ear.</p>
<p>“Then, her sparkling eyes every time she eats a pudding is genuine… God… I’ve only seen that kind of satisfied look at women when they receive jewelry or items that are limited edition.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong listens, his usually cold face suddenly becoming contemplative.</p>
<p>Then, the marketing manager behind Li Tao took a step closer. Joining the conversation with an excited tone, he says, “Boss, I told you that she’d definitely make our products popular in the internet. It’s probably going to trend for a long time!”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a lot of food advertisements, and only her real expression of delight has deeply moved me… It makes me feel anxious about not getting a bite <em>every day</em> or at least hoard the delicacies so I can enjoy it after every meal!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong is immediately reminded of the day he was in the hotel room, and the surprise he felt where he opened a drawer full of small puddings. He had let Ni Yi take two-thirds of it, Yu Yaoyao’s face distinctively crumbling to pieces at the confiscation. He suddenly feels an incoming migraine.</p>
<p>The subject of their conversation suddenly came out, apparently finished with her makeup. With the stylist’s masterful hand, her beauty was enhanced tenfold. Her makeup was particularly natural for this shoot, as the script only requires her to act like herself.</p>
<p>The trails of her gold-sequined dress drag on the ground with every step, her angled collarbones visible with single shoulder strap on each side. Rivulets of black hair hanged loosely on one side of her exposed shoulder towards her waist, defined by the slim-fitting dress. She was clutching her small, pink Chanel handbag in her hands.</p>
<p>Li Tao opened his mouth and closed it with difficulty. No wonder his elder brother didn’t introduce her to them… such a sight was enough to poke a hole in their hearts!</p>
<p><em>How deos elder brother have such a good eye for investment and an even more terrifying sight for beautiful women?!</em></p>
<p>The advertisement director, Guo Mingxu, was waiting for Yu Yaoyao for some time. As soon as she saw her come out in her glamorous apparel, his eyes lit up. His many years in the Zhuo He food company has given him the essential qualifications in food advertising and an eye for success, naturally.</p>
<p>“Have you read the script?” he immediately gets to the point.</p>
<p>“It’s straightforward. After you come back from a dinner party—of course, you are tired, you drank a lot of wine, yet you go home feeling unsatisfied. When you arrive home, stumbling towards your kid’s room, you pick up his afternoon snack from the ground, a discarded pudding, and then eat it secretly while your child is asleep.”</p>
<p>“It turns out you wanted to have some snacks. But when you did, you couldn’t stop eating and ate all the puddings your child had in the process! At first, you debated on eating it, but the appealing scent of the pudding lures you, and finally, after you’ve eaten your fill, you show the camera your great satisfaction.”</p>
<p>Director Guo Mingxu has a big beard and a small pigtail behind his head, like an intimidating artist.  Nevertheless, when it comes to acting, he was very down-to-earth and would explain to his coworkers the nature of the script and what he naturally seeks for in the filming.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the director’s words, Shen Yichong’s forehead throbs more fervently. This wouldn’t even be considered <em>acting</em> for her anymore.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Yu Yaoyao wasn’t the least concerned. She jumped in joy, excitedly nodding, “Okay, okay!”</p>
<p>At least a dozen puddings were in a small basket brought by the recognizer, and she couldn’t keep her mouth shut with laughter.</p>
<p>“If there are no more questions, then start!” Director Guo gives the ‘go’ sign, prompting the staff to sound the clicker board.</p>
<p>As written in the script, the moment the cameras started filming, Yu Yaoyao walked with unsteady steps towards her destination… the surprise room where her little pudding was hidden.</p>
<p>From time to time, she staggers, just like the drunkards she once saw at the zoo. With crooked steps, she makes her way towards the child’s room, even bumping into the doorframe. But instead of feeling the pain, her beautiful face showed a curious look of a hound sniffing her prey. Standing at the door, she takes a long inhale, her little face upturned.</p>
<p>Her eyes like dark, glittering orbs, fill with intense longing at the sudden scent of something tantalizingly sweet assaulting her senses, it almost makes her drool.</p>
