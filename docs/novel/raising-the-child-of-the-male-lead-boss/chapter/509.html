            <p><strong>Chapter 254 – Cologne (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui roamed around the airport stores in the hunt for some snacks. The mother-son duo ate their fill and packed for the travel until their bags were full to bursting. Occasionally Yu Yaoyao would point to some snack and suggest it to Little Bun. He did the same. They mostly bought and ate snacks that were strictly restricted from their diets on normal days. They were unaware of the camera moving away from them.</p>
<p>The fans thought that the cameraman had gotten tired of Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui’s antics, so he had moved away. But the reality was, as they would see when the camera came back into focus, that it was directed to a man three rows behind the mother and son. Shen Yichong stood there, in that enormous airport, gazing at his wife and son. His handsome and elegant face wore an expression that was hard to describe. Was he annoyed? Or sad? The only certain thing was that his dark eyes were full of frustration on not being able to call their names. So near, yet so far.</p>
<p>This drove the fans crazy. They expressed their own anticipation in their comments, encouraging her to look behind. But they could not be seen or heard either way. As it happened, Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui were busy sampling their snacks that they didn’t turn around. Director Zhao appeared by his side wearing a hat, and handed Shen Yichong a very bulky military coat, a wig, a false beard and a pair of glasses.</p>
<p>“I am sorry Mr. Shen,” the director said, “but you are on the same plane so you must disguise yourself.”</p>
<p>“Is it really necessary?” asked Shen Yichong, looking dejected.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t necessary before,” explained Director Zhao, “but now…What if they see you?” Director Zhao patted Shen Yichong on the shoulder sympathetically.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked so dismayed, but he received the props and went to put on the disguise. He appeared later with a padded big belly, beard and glasses, pretending to be an old man suffering from short-sightedness. The staff made a fake tattoo on his eyebrows. The elegant and handsome Shen Yichong was completely transformed.</p>
<p>“Even your relatives might not be able to recognize you now,” said Director Zhao. It was finally time to board the plane. Shen Yichong, Director Zhao, and the cameraman were late to board.</p>
<p>The cameramen around Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao had invited some curious looks from strangers, but the sign held by the participants clarified that it was a show and thankfully, the people left them alone. The sign Yu Yaoyao held said ‘’One hundred Yuan will be deducted from the family fund if passersby help you.’ The one that Shen Yichong held depicted ‘Please don’t tell my wife’. The staff had briefed the airport staff and security on the filming, to keep order and not hinder the filming. But there was no need. The strangers in the airport were having too much fun, anyway.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao got ready to board the plane with Shen Rui. Mr. Zheng approached her. “The live broadcast will be stopped before take-off, but we still have around ten minutes more,” he added, “You can start looking for your husband anytime.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded, picked up the sign and headed to the plane with Shen Rui. She walked, waving to the passengers who were taking her pictures, and welcomed those who wanted her autograph. She, very carefully, asked, “Do you know where my husband is?” The people looked behind her suspiciously. Yu Yaoyao backtracked suddenly, “Don’t tell me even if you know, ha ha. If you do, they will deduct my money. They are so bad.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was boarding the plane behind her, tried not to smile. Yu Yaoyao found her seat with Shen Rui and became quiet. She and her son snuggled together tightly with their masks and sunglasses. “Are you nervous for your first flight, baby?” she asked. Honestly, Yu Yaoyao was more anxious than him, as this was her very first flight as well. She looked through the window fearfully. “I don’t know how high it will fly,” she said faltering, “Can we even see the ground?” Yu Yaoyao closed her eyes and tried to calm down.</p>
<p>Little Bun tried comforting his mum. “It’s alright mommy,” he said, “we will get there soon. Daddy says it’s the safest means of transport. Drink something mommy, it will make you feel better.”</p>
