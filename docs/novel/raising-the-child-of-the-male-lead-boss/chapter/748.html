            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 3 – She Wants To Counterattack (3)</strong></p>
<p>She combed her long hair down to her waist a few times with her fingers and lay on the soft bed.</p>
<p>According to the plot, not long after she takes the medicine, the male lead would come home, and seeing her state, take her to the hospital. The moment she would wake up and be sober, he would push for divorce.</p>
<p><i>I’ll stop this!</i></p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, there was the faint sound of steady but fast footsteps coming from outside the room.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong adjusted his breathing before he pushed the door open. His eager pace even brought in a gust of wind.</p>
<p>But when he came to the bed, even though he had expected it, his face, which was as heavy as lead, suddenly became more solemn.</p>
<p>The woman who usually cried about everything was lying in bed in a white dress with a pale face.</p>
<p>The dark brown bed was a little messy, only a small part covered the milky white skin of her body. The smooth, soft, and straight slender legs were exposed…</p>
<p>Her wavy, black hair ran all the way down her waist, making her face look transparent in the dark.</p>
<p>Near the bedside cabinet, inside the garbage can, there were bottles of sleeping pills.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao!” The man cried.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s body shook.</p>
<p>Snakes are inherently immoral. Her blood, which had been silent for a hundred years, was somewhat agitated by this charming male voice.</p>
<p><i>Is this the diamond male lead in the book?</i></p>
<p>She whimpered, frowned, and tried to suppress her restless blood.</p>
<p>Her eyes were closed, eyelashes trembling. Although it was a little bit painful, she still tried to utter the generic lines of the female lead.</p>
<p>“Honey, don’t go…” She whispered as if she was under a nightmare.</p>
<p>The demon circle did not allow her to mate a partner at will. Therefore, mating prevented her from genuinely falling in love.</p>
<p>When she thought of the sad, nearly two hundred years of being single, her eyes could not help but shed sad tears helplessly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned as if it was the first time he knew this woman.</p>
<p>She fell asleep quietly and said that she didn’t want to leave him, even crying silently in her sleep.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao!” He shook her thin shoulders with one hand and the other dialed for an ambulance.</p>
<p>However, after one click of a number, Yu Yaoyao, the snake spirit, seemed to wake up slowly. She opened her eyes and half-squinted before she could see the handsome, tall man standing at the head of the bed clearly.</p>
<p>He stood proudly in a white shirt. Although his tie was crooked and even the hair on his forehead was disorderly, this did not lessen his good looks.</p>
<p>At the moment, his eyes were dark as ink, glinting under the dark—and there was a fire in them.</p>
<p><i>Tsk, tsk! This handsome man with a high facial value, as her first prey, is not too bad!</i></p>
<p>“Husband!”</p>
<p>Following the regular female lead operation, she was like a frightened pigeon, suddenly plunging into his arms, firmly clinging to the man’s chest and shivering all over…</p>
<p>Shen Yichong suddenly froze.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao tried to choke up another line of the female lead from the book.</p>
<p>“Wooo, wooo!” She howled miserably. “I had a dream that I died and that I’d never see you again… My heart aches as if a knife has been buried in it. It hurts so much that I can’t breathe. Now, I know that you are truly so important to me.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong subconsciously tried to pull her arms apart, but when he heard that, his movements became stiff in mid-air.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say I had to give you five million today, or else you’d die?” He took a bottle of sleeping pills from the bed and squinted.</p>
<p>It wasn’t opened.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sobbed further. “Lying to you— oh, Husband, how can I be so silly?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned and looked suspiciously at her expression.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at his distrust and dabbed at her tears again.</p>
<p>“It’s posted on the Internet that couples often surprise each other after being together for many years.” She continued. “Husband, you know I’m dumb. I can’t think of such an elaborate thing. I can only check on the internet… and ask my sister. It’s my sister who suggested it to me. You don’t seem very well… surprised?” Yu Yaoyao pitifully grabbed his clothes and looked down.</p>
<p><i>Hmm! Let Yu Xinjie, that dog, take it!</i></p>
