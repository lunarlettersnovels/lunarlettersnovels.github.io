            <p><strong>Chapter 242 – An Adamant Star (1)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao performed for nearly half an hour straight that day, and it was all seen in the video that was published. That day, she looked at the peak of her innocence, listening to the director endlessly, and walking back and forth to improvise her acting according to his wishes. Some shots were simply breathtaking. One particular scene of Yu Yaoyao turning and smiling at the camera, while her eyes reflected the colours of the rainbow, was simply a perfect shot.</p>
<p>Jia Zijie’s hands were shaking. He held an icy grip on his phone, with half a mind to shatter it. The video he was watching showed Yu Yaoyao sluggishy walking with misty eyes. It was all over the internet. He had specifically asked Advertisement Director Ji Chang to delete the remaining clips. Yet, here they were. Plastered all over the internet! When was the video taken? And who posted them?</p>
<p>His blood boiled. He was surprised when he saw the video. He wondered if someone had secretly filmed it. The only one he could think of was Yu Yaoyao’s assistant; that sleazy man might have done this behind their backs. Or, it could have been that agent, who was so incompetent and whiny and couldn’t take the slightest scolding for his own mistakes. He was seething, and hesitant to read the comments under the video. He had no choice though, so he clicked on the ‘Comments Section’. He was immediately bombarded with the tons of comments still flowing in. None of them were pleasant:</p>
<p><strong>[This makes my blood boil! You took it out of context to slander Yu Yaoyao!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[What a cruel director! Not only did you let our goddess run for half an hour, but you have the nerve to scold — no, yell at our sister Yu!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You have the nerve to say that Yu Yaoyao was incompetent? Her eyes, I looked back three times, and each time all I could see was a  beautiful light in her eyes, more beautiful and brilliant than your junk diamonds!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yu Yaoyao’s eyes are brighter than your rubbish diamond. Are you sure your diamonds are not made of glass?]</strong></p>
<p>Jia Zijie scrolled through the comments for a few minutes. He was covered in cold sweat from his forehead to the back of his shirt. It wasn’t long before Guangxin released another video taken from a low angle. The video reported that Jia Zijie had asked to terminate Yu Yaoyao’s contract because she had represented a contradictory image of the group and the product that she was supposed to be promoting. It also implied that Yu Yaoyao was threatened and intimidated. The video didn’t show any make-up artist, or dressing room but the director’s harsh manner was seen nonetheless.</p>
<p>Jia Zijie couldn’t seem to stop sweating. The videos had garnered so many views and rage from the viewers. All seemed like an elaborate set-up, further fanned by the use of the internet. Just recently, Yu Yaoyao was being slandered for being a terrible actress that became successful because of her rich connections, and her fans were being trashed for supporting her. But now, all the resentment and blame had been placed on Jia Zijie and the other director. He scrolled through some newer comments that were flooding in, all in favor of the hatred towards them:</p>
<p><strong>[To the person in charge of that stupid Excellent Diamond should come out and die!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[When talking about evil, these names should be included!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Chen Jiao represented this rubbish diamond and slandered Yu Yaoyao? He was just trying to make money! That’s the bottom line!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Shameless! I would never buy this useless diamond even if I had the </strong><strong>money!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I thought this diamond necklace was so beautiful. Even more when the beautiful Yu Yaoyao wore it. But now? Ha ha, Excellent Diamond will go bankrupt!]</strong></p>
<p>This did more to benefit Yu Yaoyao than anything else. Even the fans who had slandered her before began apologizing and blamed them for the ‘malicious and suspicious’ set up. In the blink of an eye,  Excellent Diamond, Jia Zijie and Director Ji Chang were under fire from all sides. There had been nothing but curses and negativity directed to them. Even their long-term veteran actors, and clients questioned their motives. All this had done nothing good, but had made them the most searched brand with ill intentions. Yu Yaoyao benefited more from this because fans began vouching for her acting skills and apologized for ever doubting her. One of the fans wrote:</p>
<p><strong>[Before today, I thought Yu Yaoyao was a trashy star.. But after watching this video; my heart was moved with the look in her eyes. I saw not only dedication and professionalism but also the tenacity of being strong, magnificent and adamant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Even if things were unjustly difficult, she kept her word and worked hard to continue shooting this advertisement and finish the work she had taken over dutifully—something that many famous and arrogant stars can’t do.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What an undeniable aura she has!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The haze in her eyes seemed like that of an ordinary lost girl, but the next moment the diamond necklace was taken out, the aura in her eyes changed completely: confident and powerful. Not only did it reflect in her eyes, but basically radiated in her whole being.</strong></p>
<p><b>She represented the dazzle and sparkle of which the campaign longed and represented. Not only did the eyes of the artist sparkled, with it also made this luxury advertisement eye-catching. Her acting fulfilled the director’s demanding requirement: ‘diamond eyes’!</b></p>
<p><strong>Yu Yaoyao withstood the pressure and ridicule, this alone made the impossible <em>possible</em>!</strong></p>
<p><strong>This video made me furious! From today on, this fan will cheer her up till the end!]</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had suddenly become a martyr to the viewers. It would take a long time for this to blow over; perhaps even, Yu Yaoyao’s support would become too much over time. Jia Zijie hurriedly called the Public Relations Department in panic and asked someone to send out a post or a draft saying that the video was edited. However, as he was instructing them, there was a knock on his office door.</p>
