<p><strong>Chapter 339 – Eyes of A Beast (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao managed to make her eyes look like the fiercest thing in the abandoned city of cement and steel. She even managed to portray a sense of desperate loneliness.</p>
<p>The reflectors hit her cheekbones at all the right angles, making them look sharper than they really were. It made her delicate, beautiful face look edgy and her stare more tense. Her expression told the story of someone who lived in an abandoned city.</p>
<p>“Like this?” Yu Yaoyao asked humbly. “Does my stare need to be fiercer? Do you want me look as though I gaze down upon mortals?”</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei was suddenly struck speechless. He reached up and touched his cheek. It felt as though he had been slapped a thousand times. A second ago, he had still been upset that the model for the shooting was not chosen from any of the women he had had in mind. He had been so prejudiced towards Yu Yaoyao. He’d even gone on Weibo and secretly criticized her. He had gone so far as to quarrel with people who he suspected to be her fans. In more than a few words he had said she was not suitable for his work.</p>
<p>But now, those same words were a mocking joke.</p>
<p>She had changed! She was completely different than she had been five years ago. She had become so expressive and had even found her unique aura!</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei wouldn’t let her see what he was thinking. He gritted his teeth and said coldly, “A little fiercer! A little more! It’s not enough!”</p>
<p>“Fiercer? The look of struggle? Ah, okay!” Yu Yaoyao tilted her head as he spoke. After a few seconds she nodded to show she understood.</p>
<p>She moved back and leaned on the iron fence. With one hand casually resting on the iron wire, she raised her face a little.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei’s eyes lit up, and for a moment, his mind went blank. He forgot about the phantom pain on his face, and he pressed the shutter again and again excitedly. “Good…”</p>
<p>Good, my ass! Are you dumb? He thought to himself.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei’s expression became more shocked the longer he looked at her. He started getting more and more excited. In fact, he almost yelled at her when he said, “No! You need to show a sense of struggle, as if you wanted to break out of a cage. Use your whole body! Show me your strength!”</p>
<p>“Struggle to break out the cage?” Yu Yaoyao’s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>She knew this the best! She didn’t even need to imagine how one would feel for that. She lifted her leg and fiercely kicked over an old chemical barrel. Just before it rolled away, she stepped on it elegantly. Lifting her chin, with a cold expression on her face, she turned her eyes to stare at the camera.</p>
<p>In her mind, she was a caged beast. A trapped animal. Whenever the hunter came to her den she watched him just like this.</p>
<p>She wanted to leave!</p>
<p>She wanted to escape from this cage so desperately!</p>
<p>She found the right feelings and expression in under a minute.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei’s eyes brightened. His photographer subconscious made him click the shutter non-stop. He seemed to be addicted. He kept zoning in and out of focus almost unconsciously.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had never professionally done a magazine photoshoot before. So, her stare and posture needed work. But the moment Hu Yiwui directed her to do something, she could do it immediately.</p>
<p>“Go over there and sit on the chemical barrel. Lower your chin. Push your hair back and show your whole face!” Hu Yiwei said without stopping. “Don’t move, that’s it…”</p>
<p>“Teacher Hu, it’s been almost an hour,” his assistant said gently.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei jumped as though he’d been awakened by a thunderstorm. “What?”</p>
<p>“I think it is time she gets her makeup touched up…” said the assistant tactfully.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei looked down at his camera with a dazed expression on his face. They had been shooting for an hour? He had thought he would only shoot this scene for half an hour at most! He didn’t realize he had shot for so long. He didn’t even realize it!</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei swallowed harshly. He really had… he really had become addicted to Yu Yaoyao.  He looked at her sitting obediently on the chemical barrel in front of the set. Without hesitation, he found the perfect angle and pressed the shutter again.</p>
<p>He wasn’t totally satisfied with the shot, so he took three more pictures before nodding. “Ok…Go get changed for the next theme.”</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao left, Hu Yiwei looked at the scene of the steel city in front of him with a dumbfounded expression. Taking a photo for a magazine required the model to completely immerse and integrate herself in the photography environment, not just the outfit. Her facial expressions and body movements also had to be perfectly coordinated as if they were the character living in the scene. Only in this way would the photos have a strong enough style to attract people’s attention.</p>
<p>If the characters seemed separate from the background, the viewer would feel that the model was out of place, and they would not be completely captivated by the photo. It could even fail to convey the story the photographer wanted to express.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao just… did it. And she had indeed done a fantastic job!</p>
<p>While waiting for Yu Yaoyao to get changed, Hu Yiwei looked at the semi-finished, unrefined photos on the computer. He immediately felt like his old face was being dunked into a basin of cold water. He shivered, and his whole body felt alive. He had already thought it was good when he was watching the live scene, but it was even more shocking to see the photos.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was standing by the most ordinary concrete wall, but beneath her beautiful, flawless face she seemed to have a fierce soul that belonged to some type of beast! Her eyes were full of unwillingness. She conveyed the spirit of an unyielding person who wanted to fight. With a single glance, people would be able to feel the wildness of someone who had been living in an abandoned city.</p>
<p>How could he choose between these hundred odd photos, each of which was filled with its own uniqueness?</p>
<p>At the beginning, she had still seemed a little unsure, but her performance had gotten better and better every time. He was unable to give up on any of the pictures. In his eyes, they were all masterpieces that could have made the front cover.</p>
