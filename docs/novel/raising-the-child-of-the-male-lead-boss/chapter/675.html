            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 76 – Scheming Flower</strong></p>
<p>Yesterday, he went back and browsed the comments on the internet. It was then he knew that her reputation in the entertainment circle wasn’t the least good. Yet, there was always a gut feeling in him that these criticisms were baseless.</p>
<p>As a veteran photographer from Taiwan, he has photographed many artists. And this Yu Yaoyao, made his eyes sparkle—this girl is not only photogenic, but she also has a natural charm. It’s hard to say what kind of magic it was, but she had something in her that makes people focus on her, and in turn, they won’t be able to take their eyes off. This kind of beauty—there was no doubt it belonged to a superstar.</p>
<p>Because of this, the photographer in him innately thinks highly of her.</p>
<p>Photographer Zheng quietly zoomed in the camera and saw that she was not actually expressionless—her lips were moving slightly. Upon closer inspection, one could find that she was actually murmuring something.</p>
<p>Curiously, Zheng took two more steps forward and pricked up his ears.</p>
<p>“I’m beautiful, so beautiful…Ah, how can I be so beautiful that even the heavens want to take me back, so beautiful that even the assistant director is overcome with immense jealousy? Am I really so beautiful that there is no room on earth for it?”</p>
<p>Her delicate, red lips closed and open as her pretty face looked dejectedly into the mirror. Finally, she sighed heavily, as if it was coming from the weary depths of her soul “Oh, the mirror is broken. My god, even the mirror cannot bear my beauty…Oh, this cruel world–”</p>
<p>Zhen, carrying the camera, was petrified on the spot. He even wanted to rub his ears, wondering if he had heard something wrong. <em>What is she talking about? </em>Lao Zheng swallowed and raised the camera slightly to focus on her little face, only to be bombarded with her stunning beauty in all her brilliance at close up!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the manager Ni Yi stood far away, unable to hear a sound. But upon seeing his sister on the camera diligently practicing her lines for the first time, he was finally overwhelmed with relief and ecstasy.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, I am very excited about your scene.” Meng Xinran quickly said her greetings, with the sole purpose of robbing half of the screen.</p>
<p>But it was as if Yu Yaoyao wasn’t able to hear her, too immersed in her own fragmented and secret monologue. Just like a daffodil, there was beauty as she was engrossed in her own world—there was not a room for another woman inside the screen. Meng Xinran could only grit her teeth in embarrassment, as she shuffled backward in an awkward fashion in front of the camera.</p>
<p>“Older sister Ran, don’t worry! When she comes to the stage later, there will definitely be a good show!”</p>
<p>“Yes, she’s just a rich madam. What can she do? Let’s just watch how she humiliates herself!”</p>
<p>As her minions commented spitefully, Meng Xinran stopped the gossiping party around her. But there was an unmistakable slight curl of her lips. “Stop talking, let’s all just get ready.”</p>
<p>Her eyes held a look of ferociousness at the ironic scene in front of her. Yu Yaoyao’s prop was broken, her performance title was a difficult one to perform. Moreover, she doesn’t have enough time to prepare her acting. She wants to see how this old woman could survive this time!</p>
<p>That is…if she <em>could.</em></p>
<p>Half an hour later, the assistant director reappeared in the tense preparation room. “In the same order as we drew the props, the contestants will go on stage one by one. When your name gets called, immediately go and hurry up.”</p>
<p>“Number 68, Lu Qingyi, go up! Stand by, 67!”</p>
<p>Everyone felt foolish hearing the assistant director reciting the last place contestants. And their gazes, all stretched to Meng Xinran like an angry arrow. Although this might look like a good thing where contestants on the brink of elimination get to choose props first, which in turn gives them more choices—they were actually unlucky!</p>
<p>Each contestant was to perform for five minutes. Until the very last person to perform, there was only a bountiful of time for the last contestants to prepare!</p>
<p><em>Meng Xinran… Sure enough, she only put forward the most favorable condition for herself!</em></p>
<p>They all stared at her at once, with their fury blazing. Before then, they were filled with doubt, but this realization before them hit them hard like a stone hammer!</p>
<p><em>This small flower is a scheming one!</em></p>
