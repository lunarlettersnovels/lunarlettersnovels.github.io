            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 99 – Robbers</strong></p>
<p>When Meng Xinran reached the corridor, she saw Yu Yaoyao turn her heels, heading for the bedrooms. Afterward, she dialed a number on her phone in haste.</p>
<p>“Come here now!” Meng Xinran impatiently said.</p>
<p>After her pretend trip to the bathroom went smoothly, she then made her way back to her table in the restaurant.</p>
<p>This time, during the second half of the dinner, the smile on her face had brightened considerably, especially when many people began noticing Yu Yaoyao’s absence. Reveling in this, she drank a lot of fruit wine with a sweet smile plastered on her face.</p>
<p>After tonight, Yu Yaoyao will disappear completely. She robbed her of her rightful spot, and what more, she even refused to admit she was an adulterer.</p>
<p><em>What a joke!</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran held the already empty glass in her hands, as a cruel smile formed on her lips. So, she hasn’t left home for five years, but in her first overnight at the set, she’s going to be caught red-handed with a man. <em>Would Shen Yichong still be able to clear her name?</em></p>
<p>This time, it was the will of the Gods to let her bring this woman down ultimately!</p>
<p>Meng Xinran picked up another glass of fruit wine, her mood undeniably good. Her smiling eyes moved to the glass with Yu Yaoyao’s name on it and she watched the waiter took it away.</p>
<p>After all, in that wine was a drug she poured down herself. A drug that no matter how chaste a woman is, will let her indulge in her sexual wants. And now, all that was left to do was to <em>wait</em>.</p>
<p>Her eyes squinted; she bit her bottom lip in anticipation.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Inside the Shen Residence.</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong with furrowed eyebrows, was inside his son’s room. Seeing his son’s ass facing him so defiantly, his patience couldn’t help but fade. “It’s time to go to bed.” Although his voice was a little low, he did his best not to lose his temper.</p>
<p>He had pulled the quilt up to cover his son and reached for the tablet in his son’s hand. As a result, the little bun cleverly held to the device and rolled away from his father. The pair of big, dark eyes, looked at him as if he had just suffered a grievance.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned. “If you have something to say, don’t act like a girl. Boys should learn how to express themselves.”</p>
<p>The little bun’s mouth drooped even further when he heard this. Not only is his dad a conniving man, but he also is quite the hypocrite! His dad misses his mommy, too; he even looks at his cell phone and his Weibo account eagerly unlike before.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t that thinking about mommy too?</em></p>
<p>However, the little bun withheld his thoughts and pouted instead at his father, giving him a withering look as well. He refused to hand over the tablet, wrapped tightly in his arms.</p>
<p>“Mom hasn’t called me! I can’t sleep yet…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows immediately screwed tight. He had already told Yu Yaoyao this. And after he had cleared the scandal from the earlier afternoon, he had also asked her again in private to not forget about calling their son.</p>
<p>Now, his son was going to wait for his mom’s message all night. He held the tablet without uttering a word of complaint or impatience and even stopped watching his favorite cartoon, afraid that if he was also just a beat late, he might miss the message from his mommy.</p>
<p>But she forgot.</p>
<p>“Then wait another ten minutes.” Shen Yichong said, his eyes a little icy.</p>
<p>He contacted Ni Yi about an hour ago, but Ni Yi couldn’t get through to Yu Yaoyao’s phone; moreover, he was unaware of what was happening inside the set. It was only yesterday that Yu Yaoyao was at home, promising to do right this time. She almost <em>gave </em>herself to him, but now the moment she was away from home, she was acting like a bird who had just taken flight.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s complexion turned darker as the temperature around him seemed to have dropped sharply.</p>
<p>But his mood turned for the worse when he remembered how her small hands lingered around his neck yesterday… the tantalizing snowy peaks of her chest and the shadowy figure of her charming body on the screen. This mere recollection stirred in him a familiar impetuous emotion.</p>
<p>As if he was on fire, Shen Yichong hurriedly gulped down the water placed at the small bedside drawer. However, the lukewarm water did nothing to quench the dryness and heat inside his body.</p>
<p>The little bun who had been holding the tablet like a little demon had been staring at him with big eyes as he watched his dad drink all the water from the cup. He immediately exclaimed, “Dad, that is my little tiger cup!”</p>
<p>Since his mommy had told him he was now an independent tiger cub, he had asked mama Xu to find a cup with a little tiger designed on it.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at the thing in his hand, dumbfounded. With a slight cough, he turned around and covered his abnormal state.</p>
<p>“Dad will pour you another cup.”</p>
<p>The little bun’s eyebrows creased. <em>Dad even wants to rob this cup from me!</em></p>
<p>“It seems like your mother forgot, be a good boy and go to sleep. We’ll call her again tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>The little bun remained stubbornly quiet, but there was an unmistakable downward curve along his mouth. Locked in silence, the father and son both indulged in their own electronic devices, getting along in harmony without speaking. But the atmosphere inside the room was blatantly depressive.</p>
<p>As time went on, the little bun’s head dropped lower and his chubby little hands holding the tablet began to loosen. He looked very miserable, yet still eager.</p>
<p>“Dad, can I wait for another ten minutes? Just ten more minutes…please?” asked the little bun with a wistful look, his big black eyes cloudy and confused.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt his heart was being constricted, but his eyes became firm. He had to discipline his son to not rely on his flighty mother, “Shen Rui, you have to accept some days…” he trailed mid-sentence, as a single thought invaded his mind:</p>
<p>This woman will lead them to doom regardless if she was at home or not.</p>
<p>But just as he was about to continue, a video call request suddenly flashed on the tablet’s glaring screen.</p>
