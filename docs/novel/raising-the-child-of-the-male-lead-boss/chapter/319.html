            <p><strong>Chapter 444</strong></p>
<p>“By then, you can watch uncle’s acting with your daddy.”</p>
<p>He wanted to show Shen Yichong that he could still succeed without Guangxin. He wanted people that mocked him to know that he had never relied on Shen Yichong in becoming the best actor!</p>
<p>“Will you win an award?” Little Bun’s question was straight to the point.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao trembled. Of course he wished to, but who dared to promise it?</p>
<p>“Xiao Rui, if Uncle has tried my best, I’ll accept the result, no matter how it turns out.” He struggled to make a gentle expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Uncle, you don’t seem to be confident. My mommy said that humans, especially men, tend to look upward when they’re lying.” Little Bun sighed. “My daddy always tells me not to lie if we really can’t achieve something. It would be embarrassing if you ended up not achieving what you said.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s expression was distorted.</p>
<p>“Uncle, don’t you seem very happy?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s face turned dark. He was more than upset! He now felt that he was totally crazy for deciding to come to this variety show!</p>
<p>The YY fans in the live broadcast room all felt happy and proud of what Little Bun said. While there was also a small group of people who thought that Little Bun’s roasting was a little impolite, many people refuted those comments.</p>
<p><em>[Would you not seek revenge if someone bullied your mother and betrayed your father? If I were him, I would be sure to scold and curse the person in his face. Baby Rui is already behaving like a gentleman!]</em></p>
<p><em>[How is baby Rui impolite? He was just telling the truth!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Although he used to be the best actor, the expression he had on him was so inauthentic. He obviously hates baby Rui and fishing, but he still pretends to be an uncle who’s gentle. Watching him could make me vomit!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Not to mention, even my daughter in elementary school can do better cleaning than him. You don’t even allow people to point out your shortfall?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Little Bun is right. If he doesn’t take housework seriously, will he be serious while filming? Anyone who is not blind can see that his acting skills have plummeted in recent years, and the hard-working boy from before is gone!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I bet Mr. Shen heard all this, but he didn’t come out the whole time. If he didn’t stop baby Rui’s attack on him, then baby Rui was doing the right thing. Mr. Shen never spoils his children and is a strict father. ]</em></p>
<p>Throughout the live broadcast room, there was very little sympathy for Chen Jiao. On the other hand, Gu Qianqian was praised by many people. There would be no harm without comparison. Those who spoke for Chen Jiao automatically shut up when the live broadcast turned to Gu Qianqian.</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian, who just won the best actress award, was also very good at doing housework. Ever since she got here, she had never paused and rest. She would take the initiative to find work without needing anyone’s order. When the housewives looked at her, they already knew she was someone who did housework regularly. It was definitely not an act on the show!</p>
<p>The comparison knocked out Chen Jiao’s pretense in a second!</p>
<p>Zhao Yu also conducted a personal interview with her, “Why don’t you take a break? Were you expecting this much task before coming to this show?”</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian smiled helplessly looking at the camera, “I watched the previous episodes before I came and knew that the guests were here to work.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was close to pregnancy before, and she had no productivity at all. Little Bun, on the other hand, was only five years old. It was impossible for him to do heavy work. Therefore, this family could only rely on Shen Yichong. Meanwhile, guests had no choice but to work. Otherwise, it is impossible to finish every task. Gu Qianqian had always been on top of her work.</p>
<p>“Also, Xiaoyu sent me a message before I came.” She paused after saying this.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Zhao Yu got a little excited hearing this. “Did she leave you a note?”</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian smiled bitterly, “Yes.”</p>
<p>She took out her phone and showed the private chat to the camera. A bright red envelope appeared on the screen. The note left by Yu Yaoyao was very long.</p>
<p>All the fans in the live broadcast room laughed out loud when they finally saw the note as the camera zoomed in.</p>
<p><em>“Xiao Qianqian, I will leave my big and little man to you for two days!</em></p>
<p><em>“It took me more than ten hours of talking before the father and son were finally persuaded to temporarily leave Little Sweetheart. I think they must be in a bad mood for that. Please be extremely careful.</em></p>
<p><em>“My big man doesn’t like others hanging around him, making noise, or laughing out loud when he’s in a bad mood.</em></p>
<p><em>“My little man will start to be picky and be immersed in Internet lessons, and don’t like others to interrupt him when he’s in a bad mood.</em></p>
<p><em>“By the way, here is a magic weapon for you. If you really can’t handle them, just show them this.”</em></p>
<p>At the end of the chat log was a picture of Little Sweetheart in a pink baby jumpsuit . She was spitting bubbles with her small fist outstretched through the crib. A paragraph was also added into the picture: Daddy and brother are recording a show. I shall watch that too. Cuteness was overloaded over the screen.</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian carefully put her phone away after showing everyone the chat. Then, she shook her head lightly. “So,I better do the housework well and avoid angering the father and son.”</p>
<p>Without Yu Yaoyao and Little Sweetheart here, the father and son could be very nasty. And sure enough, Chen Jiao served as an example.</p>
