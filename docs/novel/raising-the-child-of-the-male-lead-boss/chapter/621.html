            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 131 – Meng Xinran’s Downfall</strong></p>
<p>The oppressive force of the opposing army soon crushed the brain-dead fans of Ran, who insisted on her innocence. And to add more to their despair, their idol Meng Xinran was mentioned by city A police department.</p>
<p><strong>[Even when filming, one should be cautious. Obey the law, be a good citizen, and please be kind.]</strong></p>
<p>The hardcore fans couldn’t believe Meng Xinran had done evil and left messages in desperation, asking for proof. Soon, shocking photos bombarded the internet.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran was taken away from her residence by a police car. She was in her pajamas, wearing a mask on her face.</p>
<p>At the very last second, they had been arguing for her, trying to clear her name. Yet, in the next moment… she was already taken away for investigation and detained!</p>
<p>Some showbiz reporters followed up on the investigation and soon uncovered the fact that she drugged Yu Yaoyao and led a strange man into the production team to do questionable things. Police even browsed through videos and discovered residual drug from the wipes Yu Yaoyao spit her wine. And lastly, Meng Xinran’s fingerprints were all over the cup used.</p>
<p>As soon as the disturbing news came out, Meng Xinran’s fanbase instantly split into two sides. She lost millions of devoted followers, them having turned their back against their most ardent idol.</p>
<p>They remarkably felt embarrassed. Not because their idol had cheated them, but the fact that had went lengths just to protect her reputation. Only to result in being slapped in the face by Meng Xinran herself.</p>
<p>All the hearts of her fans had gone icy! Even her hardcore fans had also turned silent. The fire of the popcorn eaters overpowered the few comments that insisted on waiting for their Ranran’s return.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie, situated far away in Europe, was so livid. She smashed the glass in her hands again the moment she saw this microblog.</p>
<p>“This brainless thing!”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After four consecutive days of recuperation, Yu Yaoyao finally felt that she was in good spirits and no longer laid sick in bed. The moment she was alive and kicking again, Meng Xinran was already in complete ruination.</p>
<p>The police have now confirmed her crime and are waiting for a sentence.</p>
<p>But her attention elsewhere, Yu Yaoyao was more excited to find that her fans had risen to 1 million. Numerous fans shared the newest episode released, of where she acted alongside with Chen Jiao about cheating. Soon enough, it became a trending topic.</p>
<p>“YY’s fans? Should my fans just be called after my name?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao couldn’t understand this simple aesthetic.</p>
<p>“Don’t my fans deserve to be called <em>golden children</em>? The golden children under the Andromeda.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who had come to report on the follow-up announcement, almost bit his tongue.</p>
<p><em>Fans… golden children… then is she the jade mother?!</em></p>
<p>“Since your initials are YYY, and several masternims<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup> call you this—also adding to the fact that you have funny mannerisms, the fans decided to name themselves after you, YY. As long as you continue to make mischief as YY, they will be by your side.” Ni Yi explained, his face shaking with emotion.</p>
<p>He was so touched! Never had they experienced such dedicated fans! It was only five years ago when his older sister’s fan club, named Yu Yu, had him as the sole manager.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that there will always be a glimmer of light; hope will never fade! But… her luck was primarily black that it had negated all bad things!</p>
<p>“Elder sister, continue to entertain your fans! There is a lot to do!” Ni Yi’s was beaming like a sunflower.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao raised her eyebrows. Disapproval painted on them.</p>
<p>“<em>Entertain?</em> No, no. I was never funny.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “…”</p>
<p><em>Oh… she uses every minute in the spotlight to be humorous… but she isn’t aware of it yet.</em></p>
<p>Ni Yi had found himself laughing at her gimmicks, watching the clips that released these past two days.</p>
<p>Such as instances where her beauty broke the mirror, secretly eating small puddings and violently beating suspects and forcing him to buy her midnight snacks… he had maybe lost 2 pounds of fat just from laughing.</p>
<p>“Come now, sister. Let’s get down to business.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi paused, then changed to a serious expression.“I have bad news and good news. Which one do you want to listen to first?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao held her mobile phone as she stood on the ground. She opened the camera app and took a selfie.</p>
<p>“I am becoming more beautiful. Does my beauty suffocate you right now?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “…”</p>
