            <p><strong>Chapter 452</strong></p>
<p>The audience who missed Yaoyao sobered up. Their gossip senses made them all awake! However, everyone was confused towards the end of the show.</p>
<p><em>[What the?! Chen Jiao and Mr. Shen…Wait a minute…Chen Jiao, all you wanted was a compliment from Mr. Shen? Have you not graduated from kindergarten?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Uh… I suddenly thought of my daughter. She would insist that I put a sticker on her forehead whenever she memorized a passage correctly.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen must be shocked to learn that all Chen Jiao wanted was… his praise?!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen: It is impossible for me to praise you, even my own son rarely gets praised. At best, I can write an essay praising my wife only!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Chen Jiao: I don’t want freedom, I don’t need it! I only want to hear you say personally that you only need me!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Baby Rui: I’ve been through all the steps Uncle Gangster has taken. I understand the pain in his heart.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Wow! Plot twist!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I have been working for years but changed my job recently. My ex-boss was very strict and scolded me often. But I had a deep conversation with him before I left, and he helped me analyze how my career path should go in the future. It wasn’t until then did I realize that my ex-boss didn’t hate me as a person. Since then, I started to admire how capable he was.]</em></p>
<p>Many people left comments. YY fans, on the other hand, were very surprised. Looking back on the past, Chen Jiao ‘s actions did make them hate him very much. In the end, he did those because he lacked love?</p>
<p>As for those fans who watched the show specifically for Chen Jiao, they were also having mixed feelings at this moment. They knew Chen Jiao ‘s past and stayed by his side along the way. At this moment, they felt a little emotional watching him interact with Shen Yichong and Shen Rui.</p>
<p><em>[Brother Jiao, just go back and stop fighting alone if you are not happy.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Ah Jiao, if all you want is someone who loves and cares for you, please look around. You have always had us!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Forget it. Since you have set up your own studio, you should continue to move on. You will also find a gentle and beautiful wife who will also praise you. Don’t be afraid!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Just like what Mr. Shen said, we’re waiting for you to return to the top next year!]</em></p>
<p>The number of clicks for the program had been rising. Several hot search topics were even created.</p>
<p><em>#Chen Jiao had finally made peace with Shen Yichong.</em></p>
<p><em>#Neither a friend nor a foe; we are colleagues.</em></p>
<p>All the sponsors were currently silent. Although Yu Yaoyao was not in this episode, the reactions were still very good.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was staying at home, also watched the show.</p>
<p>The father and son were back home after nearly two weeks of recording. But when the show was being broadcasted, the father and son acted as if nothing had happened. They were each doing their own stuff, and they did not even bother to watch the show.</p>
<p>As Yu Yaoyao watched the program, Shen Yichong was looking at his baby girl sleeping soundly in the cot. He also couldn’t help but praise his daughter’s looks as he watched her. Little Bun, on the other hand, was sorting his building blocks seriously in his room. He was separating the ones that should be saved for his sister, and the ones that should be donated to the other children.</p>
<p>“Mommy, I was there all the time. I know what happened without needing to watch it,” the little bun quipped.</p>
<p>“I don’t need to watch it. I was just a supporting role who was responsible for bringing our son over and then coming back,” the older man reasoned.</p>
<p>No matter what Yu Yaoyao said, they were both unwilling to spend time watching the show. Although helpless, Yu Yaoyao could only watch the show till the end.</p>
<p>At the director’s request, the two guests each gave a testimony about their experience.</p>
<p>When it was Chen Jiao’s turn, he couldn’t help but smile at the camera. “In the past two days, I’ve done all the housework I could have done in a year,” he said. “But I’m very grateful to the program team, and also very grateful to Mr. Shen and Little Rui for their hospitality and advice, which made me realize many of my previous shortcomings. We’ll all continue to move forward, but I also want to pause temporarily. I want to give myself a break to think about where I want to go and why am I working hard for.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Shen and Yu Yaoyao. Also…although it might be useless to apologize… I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao opened her mouth and exclaimed like the audience, “Did the gangster change his attitude? Is he about to leave the industry?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was still admiring the beauty of his daughter, raised his eyebrows, “He will be back after a short rest.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blinked and found the situation a little unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Can our Baby Rui be a negotiator in the future? He successfully transformed Gangster Chen and made him apologize to you… He even apologized to me… Hmm, shall I change his nickname?”</p>
<p>After all, Gangster Chen no longer existed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong turned his head and found his wife looking regretful and pitiful. Sure enough, Yu Yaoyao was rolling on the bed and wailing in the next second.</p>
<p>“Gosh, I feel so lonely.. Oh, Darling! How lonely it is when the whole world is not against you!”</p>
<p>She felt sad she could no longer scold or bully stupid and ignorant people. This made Shen Yichong speechless. It seemed that Shen Rui was not the only one who was lacking homework!</p>
<p>“Are you that free?” Shen Yichong began, “Director Zhao will soon be gloomy because of you.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
