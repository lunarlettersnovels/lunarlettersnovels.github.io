            <p><strong>Chapter 403</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Zhao Yu realized once again that no one in Yu Yaoyao’s family was ordinary. Even though he had been in the industry for such a long time, he had never met anyone quite like the guests on the show.</p>
<p>At the moment, Little Bun was lying on the table writing his essay of praise, his chubby face pulled into a very serious expression.</p>
<p>The number of viewers in the live broadcast room skyrocketed and the rewards never stopped coming in.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, on the other hand, had already started trading. The audience in the live broadcast room, who had originally come because of Little Bun, suddenly screamed, “Mr. Shen is invincible!” and “Almighty Mr. Shen!”</p>
<p>After showing everyone his initial funds, he started trading stocks.</p>
<p>The economy was not doing well, and the stock market was even more turbulent. Almost anyone with a bit of common sense knew that it would be dangerous to trade in stocks now. One could easily lose all their capital.</p>
<p>But after only half an hour, everyone quickly realized that the five stocks he had bought had started to rise. Once the stock had risen by 10%, he would start making a profit.</p>
<p>In less than an hour, one stock rose by 5%, another by more than 5%, and another rose to 10%.</p>
<p>“It’s going better than I thought.” Shen Yichong couldn’t resist showing off online. His indifferent expression made it seem like this wasn’t anything special. “I think we can get an income of 100 000 in 10 minutes.” He looked at Director Zhao; his intention was clear.</p>
<p>The money had to be converted into family funds.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu gritted his teeth. “No, Mr. Shen. As I said, you can’t use the funds from your private account. The current income is not counted because the funds came from your private account. Family funds can only be obtained through live broadcast.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s handsome face remained expressionless.  He stretched his hand out and touched his chin. “Well, what a shame. I wanted to give the proceeds to the ‘Welcome to My Home’ staff as a gift. I planned to only use 10% of it as family funds. It looks like we can just forget that now…”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu widened his eyes in shock.</p>
<p>As a gift?</p>
<p>His scalp went numb.</p>
<p>100 000…</p>
<p>There were fewer than 10 staff members here, and Mr. Shen wanted to give them the money?</p>
<p>Everyone’s travel allowance was only 200 a day.</p>
<p>Before Zhao Yu spoke, he felt the resentful gazes of the cameramen and assistants around him. He swallowed hard and glared back at them. Then he looked at Shen Yichong with an awkward smile. “Mr. Shen, you’re so kind! We’d feel guilty taking money we haven’t earned… Keep it for when you get home.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at the screen then held his phone in front of the live camera. “I should make a profit on all these stocks within an hour. A total income of more than 200 000 isn’t impossible.” He glanced at the live broadcast room, then he glanced at Director Zhao before looking at the whole team. “What a shame. Everyone that came out with our family during such a hot summer must spend days at each stop. I also see a few familiar faces from the shooting of ‘Wife’. You guys have suffered with Yaoyao and me. I just wanted to give everyone a small gift to buy presents for their wives and kids. But since Director Zhao insists, I’ll donate the money to the children of Hope Project in the name of the production team.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked towards Zhao Yu with his thin lips pressed together.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu felt relieved. He’d been able to feel the stares of his colleagues throughout Shen Yichong’s entire speech.</p>
<p>But the objections from the entire filming team disappeared when Shen Yichong said he would donate the money instead. They all found Shen Yichong to be quite admirable.</p>
<p>The assistant director next to Zhao Yu secretly murmured to him, “Director Zhao, shouldn’t you give him additional funds as rewards? Shouldn’t such kindness and helpfulness be encouraged?”</p>
<p>Most of the cameramen agreed with him.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu had once again become the bad guy in everyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Right. Thank you, Mr. Shen for being so kind. Our program team will give an additional 100 Yuan to your family as a reward. We also thank Mr. Shen on behalf of the children who stay in the mountain area.” But as soon as he’d finished speaking, Zhao Yu felt he was, in fact, being a little stingy.</p>
<p>As expected, the live broadcast room suddenly came to life.</p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen… Thumbs up to you! 200 000; you want it, you get it! I bet those who said he relies on his wife got a proper slap from reality!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Program Team: I’m not stingy, I don’t have a budget! 10% of 200 000 is 20 000. If we gave it to you, the program team will go bankrupt! Hahahaha!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Say no more. Mr. Shen mentioned he was going to teach us about investing! Master, teach me please!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I have made some money by following Mr. Shen’s operation. I will reward Mr. Shen with some family funds! It should be allowed, right?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Master, please teach me! I’ll pay the tuition fee!]</em></p>
<p>Zhao Yu was sweating buckets looking at everyone’s comments.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Shen Yichong also saw everyone’s messages on the screen. “I don’t recommend that you follow everything I do,” he said. “Stocks should be an investment, not a gamble. I can teach you some basic investment concepts and ways to analyze the feasibility of long-term and short-term stock investment. I have, in fact, been observing the five stocks from today for a few days already. Before the market opened this afternoon, I also checked their reports and candlestick charts…”</p>
<p>For the next hour, Shen Yichong spoke about investment theory and practice with a perfectly expressionless face.</p>
<p>Director Zhao originally thought that the number of viewers would fall because of the boring topic. He never could have expected that the viewers would rise from 5000 to 10 000 as quickly as it did. Even though it was a working day, the views didn’t stop rising.</p>
<p>The viewers were not only YY fans. Some of the IDS of the viewers that flooded in showed that they were stock enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the comment section also changed drastically. Some viewers were just passersby while others were obviously investors who had come to listen to his course.</p>
<p><em>[When I heard that Mr. Shen was giving an online lecture, I immediately pretended I had to use the bathroom! Mr. Shen is a well-known investment expert in the industry. And just as I expected, I have learned a lot from him!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen, you mentioned this type of stock will not perform well in the later stage. How will we know when’s the right time to sell it off?]</em></p>
<p><em>[An aircraft carrier will be my reward! Mr. Shen, may I ask…]</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong picked a few key questions and answered them. He also took special notice of and gave extra attention to the members of the audience that gave rewards. He solemnly thanked them for their rewards. This was enough to make the group extremely excited.</p>
