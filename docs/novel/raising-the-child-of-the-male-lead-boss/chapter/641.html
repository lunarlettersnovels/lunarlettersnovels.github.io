            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 111 – A Warm Sleep</strong></p>
<p>Chen Lin sat in the opposite seat, nervously watching the little bun. Shen Rui, lest he falls from the car seat in his slumber. When he saw Shen Yichong, he became relieved and immediately gave up his position for him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong got into the back seat of the car and covered the little bun properly with a small quilt. Seeing Yu Yaoyao’s surprised expression, he began to explain. “Although the child doesn’t wake up easily, when he wakes up and finds out that we are not at home, he will be afraid.”</p>
<p>When the little bun was young, he often had nightmares about being abandoned by his mother, and it didn’t help when his father was away from home all year-round because of work. He would wake up, always in a daze, sometimes sitting to stare at the moon.</p>
<p>He didn’t want his son to experience such nightmares.</p>
<p>After he finished this sentence, Shen Yichong saw the snakes at the corner, his face instantly turning cloudy. It seems as if these snakes are more relevant to her than her son. After all, she takes them everywhere.</p>
<p>But he also guessed, if it weren’t for the snakes that scared the man from before,  it would be too late to save Yu Yaoyao even if he had time to call the police station. With such a thought, his face finally became more relaxed, looking at the snakes.</p>
<p>They drove directly to the hotel. But a new problem soon came up upon their arrival: the program’s crew had booked a family suite with two bedrooms, each having their bathrooms and one shared living room.</p>
<p>Ni Yi and Chen Lin crowded into one of the bedrooms, leaving only the other one left for occupancy. Moreover, ‘In the Limelight’ rented the other suites, leaving no more available rooms. It was the photographers, recording engineers, lighting, and directing groups that occupied most of these rooms.</p>
<p>Chen Lin also had some trepidation sharing the room with his boss.</p>
<p>“This is negligence on my part. I will call other hotels and inquire.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was holding Shen Rui, wanted to nod, but was held back by Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“It’s already so late. The baby needs to sleep properly. Stop messing around.” She looked at the little guy, who was unconsciously frowning in his sleep within his dad’s arms. Furthermore, she also felt lethargy several times in the car to the point she was too tired to open her eyes.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong bowed his head and found that his son was uncomfortable sleeping in his arms. His eyebrows couldn’t help but twist.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao was very quick. She took the room’s card from Chen Lin and went to open the door and quickly pulled the unsuspecting Chen Lin and Ni Yi inside the room.</p>
<p>“What are you afraid of, we’ll lock the door,” she said to both fearful men. “Or are you afraid I’ll peek at you?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>“Let’s go in and sleep already.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s frown remained as he held his son and went towards the big bedroom. Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao winked at Chen Lin and mouthed, “Don’t be afraid.” With that, she twisted her waist and entered the bedroom with a smile.</p>
<p>The little bun was already laid on the big bed by Shen Yichong. As Yu Yaoyao came in, he was in the middle of pulling off his tie.</p>
<p>“I’m going to take a shower, you can sleep first.” He dropped this sentence and hurried into the bathroom.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao narrowed her eyes and smiled. <em>Escaping so fast, huh.</em></p>
<p>But she obviously was not in the mood to play any more games today; she was beyond exhausted from everything that had happened. With a yawn, she felt dizziness kick in and proceeded to take off her clothes to snuggle into the soft sheets. As soon as her head touched the pillow, deep slumber slowly began to claim her. A sweet smile on her face, she took the sleeping little bun into her arms and finally closed her eyes.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong came out from the shower, he saw this unexpected, warm scene of the mother and son embracing as they slept together in bed.</p>
<p>The two fair faces, with similarfeatures, were intimately pressed together. Even when the little corners of their mouth slightly rose at the moment, the similarity is uncanny.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows couldn’t help but loosen when he saw this. He wiped his hair that was still dripping with a towel and padded to the bed.</p>
<p>He carefully picked up his son’s small hand sticking out of the quilt and was about to tuck it back inside the covers. But the moment when he opened a small portion of the sheets, a large piece of fair skin assaulted his eyes. The woman’s skin was perfect, and more importantly, she was naked! The soft creases looked like white mountains with soft peaks.</p>
<p>Although Shen Yichong’s body was cold after bathing, he felt as if a stream of hot air surrounded him!</p>
<p>“Ahh… delicious…” With closed eyes, Yu Yaoyao sleepily mumbled two words in her sleep.</p>
<p>Although they were just random words, however, they made him feel sticky like melted frosting. Shen Yichong, with indecipherable eyes, quickly put down the quilt and turned to go but was held back by a soft arm.</p>
<p>“Don’t go, I want to eat…” Yu Yaoyao muttered, some saliva escaping from the corners of her lips.</p>
