            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 179 – A Tyrant Knows No Bounds (1)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was married and had a child. When Chen Jiao used the word ‘Miss’, Shen Yichong felt very offended. On the other hand, Chen Jiao didn’t further finish his speech, but instead meaningfully looked in Shen Yichong’s direction, and happened to collide with his gloomy face!</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyes flashed, and he turned around with a smile and looked at the stage.</p>
<p>“Miss Yu, I hope we could play the male lead and the female lead for a drama in the near future. If you are interested, I will recommend you to the casting director and you can audition as the heroine.”</p>
<p>Chaotic screams rang in the hall. Chen Jiao was about to star in a new drama, and he’s playing the male lead. He even generously invited Yu Yaoyao, who had a scandal with him, to audition for the heroine!</p>
<p><em>Is this a blatant endorsement of her acting skills, or, an open statement, indicating that there is no truth in the scandal?</em></p>
<p>The audience in the hall were all gossiping, and the comment section had become a mess.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s fans rose suddenly, and soon collided with YYY fans.</p>
<p><strong>[Brother Jiao, what new drama is this? I want the name!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Did a crying drama conquer you? Brother Jiao?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Brother Jiao can do whatever he wants. Such a pure and honest person. I am asking everyone not to rub salt on his wound and insult him!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[My brother Jiao makes the move. The gossip ends here.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[My sister YYY’s final appearance, can we just enjoy it this time?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Who rubs salt on who!? Elementary school students, please find out! Who is Chen Jiao’s boss? Is my YYY the boss of this Film Emperor? Hold down your head and, don’t say anything that makes me laugh!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Why do I smell something bad coming?!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Don’t make a fuss, Mr. Shen is at the scene, I don’t know what that man is thinking but he’s most likely declaring a war.]</strong></p>
<p>Two fandoms just turned up on the live comment section because of Chen Jiao’s words. Compared to YYY fans, Chen Jiao’s fans were much bigger in numbers, and they soon overwhelmed YYY fans. However, the situation turned upside down.</p>
<p>On the stage, Yu Yaoyao picked up the microphone and faced Chen Jiao in the judges’ panel, even waved her hand repeatedly, and took a step back.</p>
<p>“I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao froze at her frank reply.</p>
<p>“We are both facing a lot of misunderstanding, so let’s not do it,” she said and touched her cheeks, thinking it was a pity.</p>
<p>The people inside the hall sighed deeply.</p>
<p>Some were of the opinion that she made the right choice while others thought that she must have broken her heart once again.</p>
<p>YYY fans were even more depressed. Although they had hoped that she wouldn’t mind the rumors before, they couldn’t do anything but follow her decision, which was mainly forced by the public opinion and finally giving up the great opportunity. Their hearts felt a great loss for her.</p>
<p>Looking at the comments the arrogant fans of Chen Jiao created on the live broadcast, YYY fandom was so agitated that they wanted to scold them back, but Yu Yaoyao had retreated, and they had no excuse to speak for her! However, a delicate and extremely narcissistic remark coming from Yu Yaoyao was heard, making all the depressed YYY fans excited.</p>
<p>They saw Yu Yaoyao, in front of the camera with a faint smile, and said to Chen Jiao with a grimace. “I’m so pretty. If you are hoping for close contact, I’m afraid you can’t. So for your own good, I’d better not to….”</p>
<p>YYY fans in the auditorium and in the live broadcast room immediately felt mad at this time, Chen Jiao’s fans flooded the comment section with harsh and unpleasant words.</p>
<p><strong>[You really think you are a fairy!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Sh*t! You think too much!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Chen Jiao, ignore her!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Leave her rot!]</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, Chen Jiao, who was photographed by the camera, wore a flabbergasted expression. He did not expect Yu Yaoyao to refuse him. On the contrary, Shen Yichong, who was holding his son in the family area, just frowned and smiled faintly. At this time, the director of the program group Zhao Yu had a stern look and asked the staff to send a microphone directly to Shen Yichong.  Zhao Yu knew all too well the love and affection between the couple because of the filming of  “My Wife and I”.</p>
<p>The host, who knew his job very well, quickly changed the topic. “What does Mr. Shen think of Madam Shen’s affairs?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took the microphone, and stared at the narcissistic woman on the stage, his mouth twitched, but his eyes showed a trace of warm indulgence.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to act, then don’t. Anyway, Guangxin Entertainment has invested in over 13 dramas in the first quarter of next year. You can choose from any of them and be the female lead.”</p>
<p>As soon as he finished, the host was shocked and stunned. This was the real monetary power of Shen Yichong! The audience was quiet for a moment, but then, they all laughed loudly. The hall not only comprised YYY fans, but also other contestants. They laughed in unison at this hilarious couple.</p>
<p><strong>[What a local tyrant! Mr. Shen is extremely powerful!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen: It’s okay wife, if you don’t get the first place, let’s go home. There are 13 dramas waiting for you to be the heroine!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The local tyrants know no rules!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Sorry, Chen Jiao, I smiled!]</strong></p>
<p>Chen Jiao, who was at the judging panel, was obviously embarrassed at the moment, but he quickly regained his composure and smiled handsomely at the camera.</p>
<p>“It’s still Boss Shen.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was standing on the stage, formed finger hearts and shot it to her husband and son sitting in the family area. In the end, Director Zhou Qiu picked up the microphone and smiled, not knowing what to say. But he finally brought back the attention of people to the competition.</p>
<p>“Today’s contestants are in their youngest and best years. It doesn’t matter if you fail at this moment. I hope that no matter what happens, in the future, the reality will not tarnish your present glory. Dig out your brilliance to the utmost level, and in the end, you will all walk out of your gloomy days. The future stage belongs to all of you, after all”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu’s passionate speech, accompanied by a warm-blooded BGM, suddenly made the atmosphere solemn, while also allowing the contestants on the stage to rekindle their enthusiasm for continued struggle regardless of their ranking.</p>
<p>“Qiu Dajian, you have light in your eyes.”</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian:  “…”</p>
<p>“Zhao Xiaomeng, you have a precious girlish appeal.”</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng: “…”</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, …”</p>
<p>Director Zhou Qiu gave his review to every contestant of the show. But when it came to the last one, Yu Yaoyao, he paused and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“I will not talk nonsense. I am very much looking forward to your character as Yu Ji in your upcoming drama. You seem to have the characteristics of a professional actor, and you will definitely lead a new brilliance in the industry. Have fun in acting.”</p>
