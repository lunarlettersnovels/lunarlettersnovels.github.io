            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 49 – A Woman’s Intuition</strong></p>
<p>“In your rise to popularity you are rumored to be in an affair with the Guangxin boss’ wife. With this, we can put forward a plea to fix the damage done on your reputation—this way you won’t have time for a big project. And then we’ll use this time to get out of Guangxin entertainment! Even if you won’t renew your contract, no one will say you’re being ungrateful.”</p>
<p>She looked at him pleadingly, “How about it? Shouldn’t we bring light to this issue once again?”</p>
<p>The man dropped the book in his hand once more and a sarcastic smile appeared on his face. “I’m not going to open this topic again and give her buzz on social media.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>He sat up and waved his hand impatiently. “The day I visited the set, Shen Yichong, surprisingly, was present. And that was tantamount to coming forward to clarify the cheating scandal for her. The rumors ended there.”</p>
<p>“Then…what about the renewal of your contract, Jiao?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s slender fingers immediately gathered together into a fist, crushing the eye mask on the sofa into a ball!</p>
<p>“You arrange for me to become a judge on <em>‘Rebirth in the Limelight’</em> after she successfully gets invited to the show,” he said, narrowing his peach blossoms. “I already have a plan.”</p>
<p>The woman in red listened to his words, and soon smiled. “Good idea!”</p>
<p>She elaborated, “Yu Yaoyao returned after five years of being away from the spotlight, and this time, I heard she has gained Director Li’s favor and will probably get his recommendation to the show. And once she takes part in this show where you are one of the judges, the public can’t help but think back to the rumors of her being secretly in love with you—and that she is taking advantage of her connections to get closer to you!”</p>
<p>Her voice rose a pitch in excitement, “Although she joined the same crew with you twice and didn’t garner attention, this time, this third coincidence will certainly arouse everyone’s suspicion!”</p>
<p>“And then, during the live broadcast, she’ll try and get closer to you and we’ll hit her with the brutal reality: you’ll reject her again and public opinion will naturally be in our favor. When you terminate your contract, it will only embarrass Shen Yichong!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyes flashed cunningly as he touched his angular chin.</p>
<p>However, it only irked him so much when he remembered her very different attitude towards him on the set that day.</p>
<p>And when the woman in red saw him being silent, she could not help but sigh. “Ah, Jiao. At such a critical time, don’t be soft.”</p>
<p>“The boss Shen has always been pressuring you, and it is now clear that he controls the number of films you receive every year. And that is precisely because his wife is linked to you and he has turned this matter into a personal feud.”</p>
<p>She strongly concluded, “We must stand on our own feet from now on!”</p>
<p>His slender fingers lightly brushed against the eye mask, and after a while, he finally smiled, “Okay, sister Wei. I will listen to you.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t know that someone was scheming behind her back, but her woman’s intuition was definitely giving her warning signs of an imminent danger.</p>
<p>As soon as she got out of the set and collapsed in the back seat of the car, she told her fat agent towards the front, “Someone’s trying to mess with me. I feel like something bad is going to happen to me in that program.”</p>
<p>The tone of her voice was like that of an aggrieved victim.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was happily smiling in the front seat after a good day’s filming. When he heard her words, the smile on his face instantly turned stiff, “What?!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao once again pressed the decline button to another of Yu Xinjie’s persistent calls and said, “But it’s okay, I’ll get through it.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “….”</p>
<p><em>Is she having delusions of persecution? </em></p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao said this sentence, she slouched further on the back seat.</p>
<p>But halfway down the road, she saw the department store outside and her eyes instantly shined.</p>
<p>“Stop the car! Let’s go do some shopping!”</p>
<p>This time she was paid $100,000 for her role, but 50% went directly to the company and her broker. Therefore, she was left with only $50,000.</p>
<p>Regardless, she made her own money!</p>
<p>Back when she was a snake in the zoo, she was visited by numerous people, got photographed and videotaped by them. In some cases, she was even scolded, bullied or even frightened until she cried—and she experienced all of these things in the zoo all year round.</p>
<p>Don’t even talk about overtime!</p>
<p>She worked hard for a hundred years, and in the end, she did not even have a penny for her savings. Thinking about the unfortunate life she led made her feel sad to the core.</p>
<p>But everything’s all right now. In this new life, she got her first income!</p>
