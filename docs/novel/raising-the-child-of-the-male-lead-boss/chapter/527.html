            <p><strong>Chapter 236 – They Never Learn (3)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Dict Groiler</em></p>
<p><em>Proofreader: Livyuna</em></p>
<p>According to the script, she needed to play a role similar to a neighborhood girl next door. When her character passes by a rich lady who is covered in jewelry, everyone is attracted to the girl instead of the rich lady… because the small diamond on her collarbone shines beautifully in the light, surpassing the various gold and colored gems owned by the rich lady next to her.</p>
<p>With her seductive image and tendency to choose bold makeup, the director can definitely pick on her for these things because Yu Yaoyao’s image is so unlike the girl in the script. She would definitely show up in bold makeup.</p>
<p>“She’ll definitely be scolded! I wonder whether this rich madam will cry and make a spectacle of herself?”</p>
<p>“This character is required to evoke the feeling of a beautiful girl next door, or even Cinderella in fairy tales. Her usual beauty and charm wouldn’t suffice because she doesn’t have that fresh innocence. ”</p>
<p>“The corners of her eyes are too raised to look innocent, so the experienced makeup artist will help her apply makeup according to the script to increase her sense of purity. But since she’s in charge of her makeup today – hehe.”</p>
<p>Everyone was gossiping, waiting to witness her making a spectacle of herself. Sometimes, people have an inherent hatred for the rich.</p>
<p>Seeing those rich people, who are usually out of reach, fall into mud and be sullied and scolded bloody by the director, or maybe even cry in public- There was a kind of abnormal sadistic pleasure in seeing them down for once!</p>
<p>And soon, under the ill-intentioned, ugly anticipation of everyone in the room, the door of the dressing room slowly opened. But it was the chubby Ni Yi who emerged first, with his broad and thick shoulders covering most of their view.</p>
<p>They felt sorry for a while in imagining her being scolded, and even wished they could bleach their eyes, till they finally saw an innocent girl walking behind Ni Yi… taking timid steps, her feet clad in white shoes, and carrying a white bag.</p>
<p>The audience’s doubts and bad thoughts were all shattered, and silence fell at once.</p>
<p>All the people who had been commenting just now, even the director and Mr. Jia, who were standing in the corner and schemed while smiling like foxes, had their eyes blinded!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was wearing the prepared blue-and-white striped student sailor suit at the moment, her dainty waist was pinched particularly thin by a light blue bow belt, and her pair of slender legs were clad in a white shoes, ordinary girls would not dare wear that style –</p>
<p>Her white cotton socks had been pulled up to above her knees, that reached to her thighs. The gap between her skirt and her socks was just a thin strip of exposed skin. Her milky thighs between the stockings, but it was full of temptation that had the earth-shattering ability to lure in any perverted uncle in sight.</p>
<p>(T/N: BRUH STOP OBJECTIFYING- YY: <em>Hehe, I’m the prettiest~</em>)</p>
<p>Jia Zijie’s Adam’s apple bobbed, and his eyes shifted to her little face. With a single glance, his eyes got stabbed, and he clenched his fists! Her little V face was extremely clear at the moment, and there was almost no trace of foundation on her skin!</p>
<p>The pair of charming water eyes, after dabbing some light pink eyeshadow, resembled cherry blossom petals on the corner of the eyes. The eyeshadow gently waned outward, narrowing and coming to close above the eyeliner. And the gleaming powder cheeks on her cheeks perfectly covered her apple cheeks, like the blush of a young girl.</p>
<p>Her originally plump and sexy pink lips were dabbed with just a touch of pink pearl, as if she was only wearing a little lip balm, and as if she were naturally born so clear and full of luster. Her makeup fulfilled all criteria of a  perfect, heart-melting girlishness!</p>
<p>Even at this moment, she stood in front of the camera looking so innocent, completely unlike a housewife who has given birth and been married for five years. Age seemed to have taken a trip back in time and halted at her teenage years!</p>
<p>Her current image unexpectedly fit the theme of the advertisement to a T.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao walked to the camera and grinned at the awestricken Director Ji Chang, “Is this good to go? Shall we start?”</p>
<p>She chuckled lightly, like a heroine stepping out of a tabletop idol drama. She quickly looked back at Ni Yi and winked secretly.</p>
<p><em>I’ve said it a long time before but I will be fine!</em></p>
<p>The “Little Yao No. 2” at home also had a sailor suit like this.</p>
<p>After getting No.2 home, Shen Yichong didn’t play with her, but Yu Yaoyao dressed the doll up frequently.</p>
<p>Little Yao No. 2′ was the inspiration for the makeup of this pink peach girl image. She just looked at the photos taken of Little Yao No. 2’and asked the store for a detailed enlargement. Since she was already beautiful, all they had to do was to add a tad bit of makeup to enhance her existing features.</p>
<p>She would’ve been handicapped had she been tasked with applying the makeup herself. But since she also had the help of a small assistant who had recently graduated from an arts college… With their combined efforts, the two of them finally applied the eyeshadow and blush on both sides of her face symmetrically within an hour and managed this natural glow.</p>
<p>Hehe!</p>
<p>After a few moments, Director Ji Chang squinted as if he couldn’t believe his eyes  and walked over towards her as if to get a better look. “Okay, let’s start!”</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, listen carefully to my request: I need you to stand in front of the camera later, wearing this diamond necklace. Show a clarity in your eyes that matches the flawless clarity only a diamond can have. And I ask for brightness, I want to see the light flicker in your eyes, as if it were filled with purity in the most scalding fires!”</p>
<p>Before Ni Yi could laugh, his expression became stiff.</p>
<p><strong>(T/N: Every chapters begins and ends with a clueless Ni Yi, almost want to buy him some sympathy ramen for all the twists and turns he’s been facing, piled on top of a boat load of dog food lol)</strong></p>
