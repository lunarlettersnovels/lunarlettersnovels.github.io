            <p><strong>Chapter 380</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>In the first act of the TV series, the school bully threatened the protagonist, a rich young master, for money. In the next scene, Yu Yaoyao appeared on screen, chewing gun with the hem of her long school uniform tied around her waist. With her left hand plunged deep into her pocket, she walked leisurely up to the bully. As she drew closer, she pulled a small switch blade out and tossed it into the air, catching it easily.</p>
<p>“How dare you lay a hand on my people in my territory? Are you sick of living, fat pig?” The cliché, naïve lines suddenly picked up a strong domineering tone when she said them. And then she kicked his ass straight into a trash can.</p>
<p>The entire play was rather ridiculous, but people just couldn’t help but watch it.</p>
<p>An hour later, Weibo was once again a hub of activity:</p>
<p><em>[Damn it, why is this a weekly broadcast! I don’t want itttttttttttttttttttttt!]</em></p>
<p><em>[My Yaoyao fascinated me right from the very beginning. Did you see that fly-kick?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Too handsome, too cool! I can’t handle this anymore! Only the strong arms my husband Yu Yaoyao can save me now!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’ve only watched the first episode, and I want to say… I think the male lead in this play is our Yaoyao, and the female lead, is in fact, Qiu Dajian!]</em></p>
<p><em>[ Look at my Yaoyao’s aura! I licked my screen for the entire episode, and before I knew it, I was watching the second one! I’m going to rewatch the first episode right now!]</em></p>
<p>Everyone was praising Yu Yaoyao’s performance. The rating for the play went from the 6 stars it had before its release, to a solid 8 stars.</p>
<p>After watching the first episode, many fans started writing comments in the comment section. The number of viewers on the broadcasting platform sky-rocketed, and the barrage was so intense it was almost impossible to read.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao appeared, everyone madly typed and sent ‘Husband, I love you!’</p>
<p>When Qiu Dajian appeared, everyone wrote, ‘Let go of my husband. Let me do it!’</p>
<p>Luckily, modern broadcasting systems were more advanced and capable than they had been a few years ago. The system made sure the barrage avoided all portraits or full faces.</p>
<p>The fans happily spammed the barrage as they enjoyed the beauty of Yu Yaoyao and the plot.</p>
<p>Later that evening, at around 10 o’clock, the investor was left stunned by the data of the backend report. “Already ten million clicks?”</p>
<p>It had only been two hours.</p>
<p>This achievement was absolutely amazing for such a low-cost web drama!</p>
<p>And Yu Yaoyao, who was lying contently in her husband’s arms, was watching her own drama on TV.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong only managed to watch for a while before he reached for the control and turned the barrage off. The repeated words of ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ were giving him a headache.</p>
<p>“Darling? Why did you turn it off? It’s interesting! I can at least see the netizen’s interactions with me!” Yu Yaoyao said pitifully. Watching the praise from all the netizens who loved her made her extremely happy.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. “Watch the drama critically so you can reflect and see where you need to improve. The comments are going to distract you.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” Yu Yaoyao said with a regretful sigh.</p>
<p>When they had finished watching, Shen Yichong tried to pull Yu Yaoyao down on the quilt with him. But her small, soft hand pressed against his chest to stop him.</p>
<p>“Darling, don’t distract me. I’m still reflecting,” Yu Yaoyao said cheekily.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his brow, his expression remaining perfectly neutral. Without hesitation, he took off her underwear. “Very well. Reflect out loud to me. You just lie there and use your brain. I’ll do all the work.”</p>
<p>Yu YaoYao was shocked! He was smarter than she was! She quickly reflected on what he’d said.</p>
<p>But 10 minutes later, she could do nothing more than pant and moan. She couldn’t even form a complete sentence.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong leaned over and kissed her babbling red lips, as she tried to reflect on her acting skills:</p>
<p>Her legs were gorgeous, but she never lifted them high enough for the audience to see.</p>
<p>Her face was very delicate, but she didn’t let the villain get close enough to see her features properly.</p>
<p>Her voice was so sweet, but she didn’t get to speak because the male lead fled after she punched the wall.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong wasn’t the least bit interested in what she was saying. He pressed her firmly against the bed, rendering her unable to breathe, let alone speak!</p>
<p>He took a brief second to recall the script.</p>
<p>A female killer wouldn’t need to wear a skirt or heavy makeup, and there wouldn’t be any kiss scenes. He’d email that reasoning to the producer the next day during the meeting.</p>
<p>Because he had such a beautiful wife, Shen Yichong was constantly worried.</p>
<p>And the very next day, Yu Yaoyao proved his worries warranted.</p>
<p>‘Youth Without Regrets’ had been played a total of 6.84 million times in the past 24 hours!</p>
<p>Many of her old fans, new fans, and casual viewers who mainly watched dramas, had watched the drama twice or more.</p>
<p>“It has to go further,” Shen Yichong said to the producers over the phone while he ate breakfast. “The comments and feedback for the trailer next week are all good. The marketing team needs to keep up. Let’s set a small goal for the daily broadcast volume for next week. Let’s say… 100 million views?”</p>
<p>“A 100 million? In a single day?” the person in charge of production said in shock.</p>
<p>In what world was that a small goal?</p>
<p>Mr. Shen was aiming for the impossible!</p>
<p>But the data the producer received over the next two weeks was shocking. On average, the drama got 100.48 million views per day.</p>
<p>This web drama had beaten all the popular web dramas from that year and the before that. It had also set a new record for the broadcasting platform!</p>
<p>They’d made it big!</p>
<p>The crew, producers, investors, and actors were ecstatic!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was the only one who seemed displeased. “Darling, now that we have achieved your small goal, can we reach for something bigger?”</p>
