            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 22 – Amusement Park</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the central character, Yu Yaoyao, was currently standing in front of the amusement park. Her excitement was higher than the steamed buns!</p>
<p>Her eyes, which were caught in the light, were completely glued to the pink Mickey Mouse balloon at the gate. But her feet would not move.</p>
<p><i>I want it. I want it so much.</i></p>
<p>She had little chance to see the outside world and had, therefore, learned most of her knowledge by watching TV, surfing the internet, and reading.</p>
<p>But balloons, she had always wanted them!</p>
<p>Back in the zoo, many children had colorful, inflatable balloons in their hands. Every time she could only look at them admiringly through the cold glass separating them.</p>
<p>“Baby, do you want that balloon?” While she said this, her eyes were full of longing.</p>
<p>The steamed bun, Shen Rui, who had long been tired of playing with balloons, immediately saw the watery look in her eyes. “Yes…?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately glanced at Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>The corners of his mouth twitched. “Which one do you want?”</p>
<p>Shen Rui also looked at her, and after some hesitation, he slowly spoke, “Uhm… pink?”</p>
<p>“Wow, the baby has an aesthetic taste like his mother.” Yu Yaoyao squatted down and happily hugged him, rubbing her little face on the steamed bun’s fluffy cheeks.</p>
<p>The steamed bun flushed pink in an instant and did not waste a second longer to give her the small balloon handed over by his father.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled like a fool and bowed her head to tie the thread of the pink Mickey Mouse balloon to her right wrist. Like how other children did it. But this one-handed operation, in the end, was too difficult for her.</p>
<p>With a small pout, she slowly turned around and looked at the cold-faced man in front of her pitifully. “Husband… help me.”</p>
<p>Her voice was soft and husky, and this tone of speaking made the passing men blush.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong eyebrows scrunched together but couldn’t let his assistant do it. Grudgingly, he ordered, “Come here.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled, ran over carelessly, and stretched out her delicate, snow-white wrist.</p>
<p>Her skin, as if naturally soaked in milk, looked healthy and fair.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was unknown if it was from a psychological effect or due to something else, but after she came out of the hospital, the original white skin which held a pale, dim sheen, was now glowing and radiant.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong bowed his head and tied the rope on her wrist, the light of the sun refracted on her snow-white skin, highlighting it like a pearl and trapping him in a trance. And there was a faint sweet fragrance also floating in the wind, that he could mildly smell.</p>
<p>“Wow!” After he had finished tying it up, Yu Yaoyao shook her right hand, her eyes filled with joy—one that he hadn’t seen in years. And like a child who got a toy from Santa Claus, she happily turned on the spot three times!</p>
<p>“Thank you!” Her appealing face, delicate eyes, moving pink lips and white teeth framed by her inky black hair painted an ethereal picture.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong dropped his gaze. “Let’s go in.”</p>
<p>She had attracted the attention of many passersby around her with her beauty a long time ago.</p>
<p>“Okay, little baby hold on to me, mommy is leading the charge! Our task today is to finish all the rides!” She declared excitedly. Yu Yaoyao was currently new to everything as a runaway wild horse.</p>
<p>Ferris wheel, mazes, pirate ship, water coasters—she couldn’t wait to try these rides, but when they flew to the sky, she screamed louder than the steamed bun Shen Rui.</p>
<p>Before the Ferris wheel ride, Shen Yichong looked down at a pale Yu Yaoyao, her legs soft as noodles. His eyebrows twisted once more, “If you feel sick, then don’t ride it.”</p>
<p>Without waiting for her reply, he looked towards his son and said, “Shen Rui, dad wants to play with you.” the corners of his mouth lifting to a small smile as he picked up his son, whose little face was rosy with joy today.</p>
<p>“No, wait! I still want to play!” Yu Yaoyao who had a hand over her chest, where her heart was about to burst from her ribcage, opened her mouth in a hurry.</p>
<p>“It’s fun to feel bad… right?”</p>
<p>It was strange that the human’s definition of thrill almost made her feel like she was about to die. But they still all like it very much! And the female leads on the TV shows she had watched were beaming enthusiastically in the amusement park.</p>
<p>No, she has to correct her feelings!</p>
<p>Half an hour later when they got off the roller coaster, Yu Yaoyao was face had gone white and her mouth was open, ready to vomit. A surprised Shen Yichong immediately came to the rescue, albeit reluctantly!</p>
<p>Chen Lin bought some ice cream for the steamed bun and helped the boss carry the madam’s bag, as he asked the boss to take his wife to the bathroom.</p>
<p>When they came back, Chen Lin looked at Yu Yaoyao with blatant admiration on his face before facing Shen Yichong with respect. “Boss, Madam is on the hot search again.”</p>
<p><b><i>#YuYaoyaoNauseaVomiting, SecondChildMightBeASuccess! </i></b></p>
<p><i>Awesome! Boss, the rumor was broken at the speed of light! </i></p>
