            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 91 – Joke’s on You</strong></p>
<p>As Meng Xinran was lost in her thoughts, the next moment, her arm was seized by Yu Yaoyao and she let out a surprised whimper.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s delicate voice drifted into her ear. “Little sister Ran, you are really a good Samaritan… I’m so beautiful—if they let me play this ugly role of a beggar, of course I will cry to death.”</p>
<p>The corners of Meng Xinran’s lips were still raised. <em>Haha! Cry, she’ll cry to death acting as a begga–</em></p>
<p>“What!? Wait, you don’t like begging most…?” Meng Xinran suddenly stared, stupefied, as the corners of her smiling mouth froze!</p>
<p>Driven almost to tears at Meng Xinran’s sudden enlightenment, Yu Yaoyao revealed a radiant, narcissistic smile on her face. She lowered her voice that only the other person was able to hear:</p>
<p>“It would be inappropriate for a fairy like me to act as a beggar, wouldn’t it? I have to wear torn clothes and have my face dirtied till I looked like a stranger; my beautiful self wouldn’t be able to shine at all… Of course, I wouldn’t choose the short end of the stick—am I so stupid in my sister’s heart?”</p>
<p>Her lips cocked to a full smirk, “Thank you, my good sister… thank you for taking away the most unsuitable role for me.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran stepped back, her face in disbelief.</p>
<p>“It’s not a topic I can easily play…naturally, the topic of a madam is more suitable for me!” Yu Yaoyao’s beautiful eyes shined bright like crystals, colorful as they look at Meng Xinran.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t that scream <em>me</em>?”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s blood climbed to her head!</p>
<p><em>How could this happen? From the very beginning, she had deliberately said the opposite!? Purposely deceiving the contestants so she can actually choose the topic she wanted the most?</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s eyes were about to breath fire, but she had to force herself to squeeze out a smile in front of the camera.</p>
<p>“If sister likes it…that’s good,” she mumbled as her nails dug into the palms of her hand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Soon after, the program’s stylist brought her the beggar’s clothes which were ragged and looked filthy.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran could only endure vomiting blood on the spot as she looked at this set of dirty clothes of which were far from their original color. And her once smooth, straight hair, which has always been well maintained, was also combed into a mess by the makeup artists. Thich, black eye shadow was even smeared on her fair face, making her original appearance impossible to be seen past the horrendous get-up!</p>
<p>Meng Xinran looked at her reflection in the mirror and trembled with anger.</p>
<p>This Yu Yaoyao pretended to be fooled, but deliberately set her up! She let her think the role of a beggar was advantageous, when it was not the case! Her current appearance of a beggar doesn’t even show a hint of her original appearance; which was tantamount as losing all the benefit of having beautiful looks!</p>
<p>This is the only topic that had to be carried by immense acting today!</p>
<p><em>Yu Yaoyao! This damned Yu Yaoyao!</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran looked at her face which was painted black and gray, her hair like hay, and wanted to scream from a massive fury threatening to burst out.</p>
<p>She could only thin, <em>how on earth did Yu Yaoyao discover their trap?</em></p>
<p>The last contestant had agreed to help her only yesterday; Meng Xinran couldn’t understand how it all led to this.</p>
<p>On the other side…while waiting for the makeup artists to finish her makeup, Yu Yaoyao was also sitting on the makeup chair next to her awaiting for the look of her performance topic. Even with a little lipstick on and some highlight, her face already looked flawless and beautiful!</p>
<p>Meng Xinran merely glanced at her for a moment, and her mind went blank with anger.</p>
<p>And for the next hour of preparation, she wasn’t able to calm down. Even if they were still backstage–Yu Yaoyao donning a light blue, chiffon dress made her temperament feel as if she was the snow caps on top of a mountain, beautiful and elegant.</p>
<p>She was so furious that her breath became erratic.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao–she must destroy this woman and let her crawl under her feet until she cries from misery!</p>
<p>However, Meng Xinran soon heard the voice of the staff urging her to go next, and she gnashed her teeth as she made her way to the stage.</p>
