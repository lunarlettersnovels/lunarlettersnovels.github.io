            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 59 – Her Comeback</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[I see so many people roasting you. Don’t you have a guilty conscience? Are you going to cry? Are you mourning now? Hahaha!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[Get out of the entertainment circle! You have no acting skills and only have scandals. Moreover, you also want to drag our fairy elder brother to the mud with you! Truly disgusting!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[A married madam who already has a child dared to take the first room from Ranran! You don’t even know how to act!]</em></strong></p>
<p>When her face appeared in the broadcast, the number of people viewing her channel soared. Everyone was so angry at the scene that they roasted her immediately.</p>
<p>They obviously want to leave hateful comments until she quits her live broadcast!</p>
<p>Ni Yi was out watching the situation in the live broadcasting room and was in a state of panic. But, Yu Yaoyao inside the room did not pay attention at all to the unending bitter comments on her channel.</p>
<p>At the first glance, she was fascinated with her stunning face, which appeared on the big screen of the computer.</p>
<p>Red plump lips slightly open and her twinkling eyes widened, she stretched out her hand, unable to stop herself from touching her beautiful little face.</p>
<p><em>My God! Even on screen–how can I be so beautiful!?</em></p>
<p>Stars instantly danced in her apricot-colored eyes; her slightly raised eyelids and thick curly eyelashes trembled slightly like a small butterfly taking flight. Her tear mole against her porcelain skin hinted a trace of glamour.</p>
<p><em>What a touching beauty</em>…for decades she has watched Korean dramas and had imagined acting in these stories as her human self. She was very assured that she would even be better than that of the heroine.</p>
<p>And today is the first time she has seen herself on the screen–her <em>human</em> self.</p>
<p>The wicked comments on her channel did not dampen her mood at all. These curses were like the light of fireflies; how can they shadow her beautiful light that was like the essence of the sun and the moon?</p>
<p>Her beautiful eyes blinked furiously thinking about it, and suddenly a drop of crystal tear rolled down her face. She mumbled, “It turns out that it is such a happy moment to finally see your face appear on screen.”</p>
<p>Her petal-like lips pulled out at the corners to display a sad smile. Her solemn eyes, with tears streaming down her cheeks, were glistening under the light as they watched the live broadcast carefully.</p>
<p>“After all these years…the day I have waited for so long has finally come.”</p>
<p>She’s beautiful! She is <em>so</em> beautiful! And her beauty moved her to tears!</p>
<p>Her voice was soft, as if feathers were brushing in the ears of those who were listening. The natural, melodic, feminine voice was like the voice of an angel. When she spewed out word for word, it made no difference. But the combined sentence made all the online keyboard warriors roasting shiver uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Her voice was gentle and her pronunciation very slow.</p>
<p>But she spoke as if she had traveled through treacherous mountains and waters, experiencing tremendous difficulties along the way. Only in the end has she acquired precious things: a mountain full of treasure, as well as the joyous moment of recovering what she has lost.</p>
<p>“Here I am.” Her red lips were lightly parted, and her eyes were set ablaze with a firm kind of light.</p>
<p>Clearly, her room has not been equipped with any type of reflective panels, only a row of light bulbs was littered in front of her makeup mirror. But her white skin, as if covered by a shining halo—no, rather, it was like a ray of light deep in from her body was threatening to burst or from her pristine skin…</p>
<p>The malicious comments in her channel came to a sudden halt, as if a real-life pause button was pressed.</p>
<p>By then, the number of viewers had risen from 54 to 64…99…139…and the number of watchers coming in, keep rising!</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who had been looking at his mobile phone in nervousness, took a breath. He touched his forehead and found it was sweaty as expected.</p>
<p>He also thought that as soon as she spoke, she would be scolded like a dog.</p>
<p>Instead…</p>
<p>He looked at Yu Yaoyao on the screen with complicated eyes.</p>
<p>Even if he had been with her five years ago, he still feels that the woman now in front of him was a little more thrilling than before. Her face and delicate facial features had obviously remained unchanged, but he always feels that there was something different with this current her. A kind of new, temperament waking up in her body.</p>
<p><em>“Here I am.” </em>This short sentence is uttered simply, without any flowing adjectives or in strong voice.</p>
<p>But as Ni Yi listened, his eyes instantly became hot, and he reached out to wipe them.</p>
<p><em>A comeback! Sister is finally back!</em></p>
<p>She said this time in the entertainment circle she is going to soar! An unstoppable comeback five years later—she will fly to the top of the peak!</p>
<p>Ni Yi took a deep breath to steady his self and felt the heart in his chest burning in fervor from her stirring words.</p>
