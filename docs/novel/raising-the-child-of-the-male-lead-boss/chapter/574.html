            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 181 – Peculiar People (1)</strong></p>
<p>The final celebration of the program ‘In the Limelight’ was an important opportunity for every young newcomer to establish more connections with people in the entertainment circle. At the celebration-meet, there were the program director, the three senior judges, and even the heads of many entertainment companies and reporters from different entertainment industries.</p>
<p>This was a rare opportunity for many young artists. However, Yu Yaoyao didn’t care and immediately left the auditorium.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?… Gone…?”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu stared at his assistant dumbfounded. He never thought Yu Yaoyao would leave the set early.</p>
<p>“Okay…”</p>
<p><em>She was escorted by President Shen, how could she not know how important this occasion was?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps her family had already seen their share of bigwigs in their own parties. Therefore, she didn’t need to attend the gala and fight for attention anymore. Zhao Yu sighed at the thought of his blunder. If he had known beforehand, he would have sent someone to block her and ensure that she would attend the after-party. After all, she’s the champion of the show.</p>
<p>He glanced at the people at the party and saw Chen Ruixi, who seemed to be laughing, holding a wine glass, and chatting with several entertainment company bosses. He shook his head at the mere sight of her.</p>
<p><em>What a fate!</em></p>
<p>“Let’s go.” Zhao Yu waved his hand while walking. But halfway through, he stopped.</p>
<p>“She left, the family of three are probably celebrating the success of Yu Yaoyao right now!”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu’s face changed greatly when he saw someone familiar.</p>
<p>“Lao Zheng, Lao Zheng!?”</p>
<p>Lao Zheng, the cameraman of ‘In the Limelight’ who had just taken a sip of red wine, was immediately summoned by Zhao Yu.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu, who seemed hurt, immediately ordered him. “I was negligent, but I can’t walk away now. So you call the camera crew and follow Yu Yaoyao! I will call and ask them where they are right now. And then the team can go after them!”</p>
<p>This kind of private, sweet celebration, together with their cute and adorable son, once filmed would for sure increase the ratings of ‘My Wife and I’ to another level.</p>
<p>On that note, he immediately pulled out his phone and tried calling Yu Yaoyao, since calling her was easy and she’s much more approachable than Boss Shen. Additionally, she liked to be seen on the camera which made it an even better idea.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was confident that he could persuade her to make an emergency special filming for ‘My Wife and I’. Anyway, after being the ‘In the Limelight’ champion, her popularity would soar and she must seize this opportunity to further rocket her recognition!</p>
<p>Cameraman Lao Zheng, also quickly called his fellow cameramen, chewed another piece of steak while waiting for the updates from Zhao Yu standing beside him and then set up the camera.</p>
<p>But soon… Yu Yaoyao, who was already on the phone, suddenly laughed and giggled which was heard by Zhao Yu from the other side.</p>
<p>“Oh, a lot of big lobsters! Husband, I want to eat all of this until I can no longer take it.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu’s eyes immediately lit up. “Yu Yaoyao, are you eating right now? I want to start recording right now for the follow-up shoot of ‘My Wife and I’. The next issue, remember? After you sign up as the heroine for an upcoming online drama, I think our time together will become lesser and your schedule full. So… you and Mr. Shen, where are you eating right now? I will tell the cameramen to go there now to start the filming.”</p>
<p>“Ah? Are you coming?” Yu Yaoyao was shocked at the moment. “Do you want to come and eat lobsters too?”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was about to answer, however, he heard her high-pitched voice exclaiming over the phone.</p>
<p>“Husband, Zhao Yu is coming here and will bring a lot of people to eat lobsters! This one is not enough for me to eat, I want to eat the three big and tender ones!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was momentarily distracted.</p>
<p><em>How many lobsters does she want to eat? What does it have to do with us going to that place?</em></p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, we will not eat any of your lobsters. We will go there to have a follow-up shoot of the reality show.” He hastened to clarify her misunderstanding.</p>
<p>“Husband, husband, Zhao Yu said that three is not enough… let’s order five! Ah, not small lobsters but a big one, right?”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu: “…… ?!”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was stupefied and did not know where to start explaining to make sure Yu Yaoyao grasped the situation properly. Not only did she went overboard, but Lao Zheng, who began taking photos randomly inside the party, was also stunned as he overheard their conversation.</p>
<p>Soon, Yu Yaoyao couldn’t hear them as the hall became a little noisy and the signal was bad. But after a while, Zhao Yu increased his volume and tried explaining to her the reason they are going there from the very beginning.</p>
<p>However, he heard a cold voice on the other end of the phone as if it was a chilly wind, rubbing coldly in his ear.</p>
<p>“Zhao Yu, you sure are working hard. When my wife and I finish dinner, you come to the villa to continue the filming. See you at the villa.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu: “…”</p>
<p><em>Oh my gosh! President Shen really didn’t want anyone to meddle with his family! Mr. Shen turned out to be a cheapskate!</em></p>
<p>Zhao Yu really wouldn’t let go of them this time!</p>
<p>Lao Zheng wiped the camera lens with pity but whispered the truth. “Zhao Yu, the young couple might have decided to not come to the party to have a romantic dinner together. It is obvious that they want to enjoy the success of Yu Yaoyao together… You are so insensitive, you don’t understand amorous feelings. Mr. Shen… certainly won’t agree to you filming their wonderful time together right now. ”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu hissed. “I see!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong always disliked him and his team, at least that’s what he presumed.</p>
<p>“Hey, after eating let’s head to the villa. Maybe we can wait for two hours before going there.”</p>
<p>The staff of the variety show team was accustomed to working overtime. In particular, they could cope up even with the slightest changes in a popular artist’s schedule. It was inevitable for them to shoot upside down, day and night.</p>
<p>Lao Zheng was a senior cameraman who had experienced the most difficult periods in his profession, he did not sleep for two or three days in a row, and ran around. But… now… he was a little hesitant.</p>
