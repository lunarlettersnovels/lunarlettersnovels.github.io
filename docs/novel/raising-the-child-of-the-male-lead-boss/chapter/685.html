            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 66 – First Endorsement</strong></p>
<p>When the live broadcast was over, all the contestants walked out of their respective rooms—some in trepidation, others in confidence, to know the real-time rankings for the preliminaries.</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised by the dark horse, Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s face was extremely ugly looking at the result, but face to face with another person, she pretended to look lovely and smiling. But after a while, she couldn’t bear her rising fury, so she said her goodbyes to everyone and hurriedly left with her manager.</p>
<p>Just as when she first step foot inside the nanny van, she wrathfully threw the thermos she was holding in her hand onto the car seat.</p>
<p>“She’s <em>fifth</em>!?” she shrieked. “She has more than 7,000 votes and is now part of the top ten? Is she even an A-list actress like me!?”</p>
<p>The manager’s face changed upon Meng Xinran’s abrupt outburst. He tried to reason, “Little Ran, I watched her live broadcast…she portrayed her scene as a poor woman very well.”</p>
<p>“No! She must be eliminated!”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s fingers were digging into the cushions of the backseat in the car.</p>
<p>Back at the production for the ‘<em>Golden Age Empress’</em>, she had been inferior to Yu Yaoyao’s unexpected acting skills…she was quite afraid that when the date comes for the TV series to be broadcasted, she might be ousted by the audience for being less beautiful than Yu Yaoyao and for their performance to be compared—the worst is that they will it <em>mediocre.</em></p>
<p>But if Yu Yaoyao is quickly eliminated from ‘<em>In the Limelight’</em>, people can deduce that luck was on her side in the TV series, and she was acting as how she really is!</p>
<p>The broker was in a dilemma. “I wasn’t expecting the results of the preliminaries to be like this. But it’s a fact that she has a huge advantage to be part of the ranking with the great number of votes. By the way, the sixty-eighth contestant, who is a candidate for elimination, only gained 1300 votes.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran gritted her teeth in frustration.</p>
<p>“The second part of the program is a formal stage performance. Think about that instead and prepare for it. Anyway, you obtained the first place; at the very least you have met our expectations and haven’t affected possible endorsements on our new films in the future,” the broker said, feeling an incoming migraine.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran merely closed her eyes, took a deep breath and uttered a single reply, “All right.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Towards the other side…Yu Yaoyao immediately collapsed into the nanny van but was then shocked by Ni Yi’s high excitement.</p>
<p>“Sister, you are too good! You had more than seven thousand votes!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was sitting in the back seat when she heard this, and the corners of her lips gently lifted, “Well, it was to be expected. My beauty is an ethereal kind after all.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s voice suddenly got stuck. <em>You can never praise a person who is narcissistic to the extreme!</em></p>
<p>But the next second, his cell phone rings. He picked it up hastily and answer with a standard greeting, “Hello, this is Ni Yi. You are…hmm!?”</p>
<p>Listening for almost half a minute, his muted, dark green eyes became brighter. Finally, he said, “All right, we’ll think about it first. We’ll get back to you right away!”</p>
<p>With that, he hung up, and he jumped up, his head colliding with the roof of the car! The scream that tore from out of him could not contain the giddiness and surprise in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Sister, sister…we’re advancing! This time we are really climbing the ladder!”</p>
<p>“A sponsor watched your highlight video for the competition and asked you to be their brand ambassador for fried potato chips all year round! Ahh! They’re going to use their official Weibo account right this moment to share your short clips eating potato chips!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blinked and raised her hand, a slight smile poised on her red lips. “Aha, they have good eyes, yes.”</p>
<p>After a while, she added, “By the way, in these endorsements, do we receive gifts? How about a new flavor of potato chips?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi: ….</p>
<p>As the van drove Yu Yaoyao to her home, @<em>Lay’sChinaOfficial </em>shared the short video of Yu Yaoyao’s acting performance as a poor person eating potato chips. Furthermore, her voting link is attached to the video.</p>
<p>In just an hour, there were more than 100,000 shares and 5,000 comments under the video. Ultimately, Yu Yaoyao’s latest votes went to an astounding 14,673.</p>
<p>She overtook Meng Xinran for the first place by thousands of votes!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hashtag: <em>#TheSmellOfFriedPotatoChipsMadeHerCry</em> also trended in the Weibo hot searches!</p>
<p>Many people who did not know the truth behind the video were lured by this title and clicked at it, with nothing else to do in their mobile phones. Nevertheless, they were soon overwhelmed with Yu Yaoyao’s touching performance.</p>
<p><strong><em>[Hahaha, what kind of sorcery is this? With just one pack of potato chips, she can make an expression as if she ate 300 pieces of high-quality steak!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[After seeing this video, I silently placed down the potato chips in my hand. I’m sorry, I should burn incense and change my clothes—so that I can properly enjoy it’s rare and tear-provoking taste!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[After today, I realized potato chips actually offer a lot of flavors. I’m going to place an order for all different kinds of flavor and wait for it to arrive tonight!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[This young miss is a little too good-looking! Her puppy-eyed look makes my heartache! Is there is no one willing to buy potato chips for my sister to eat?]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[What’s this sister’s name?!]</em></strong></p>
<p>Comments stacked on one another, forming a high chain. In the process, Yu Yaoyao’s votes also rose!</p>
