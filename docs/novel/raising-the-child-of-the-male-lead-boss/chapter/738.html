            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 13 – Let The Director Become A Little Clear-Headed (1)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao declined Yu Xinjie’s 38th call and smiled at the distressed little bun in front of her.</p>
<p>“Don’t like vegetables? You won’t eat your carrots?”</p>
<p>She picked up the delicious dish from the bowl with her chopsticks, “Look at mom. Oh, mom’s going to eat it in one mouthful!” and opening her mouth wide, she stuffed the vegetable inside. Her eyes closed for a moment as her mouth chewed, cheeks bulging.</p>
<p>The little bun in front of her, holding his own small rice bowl, was looking at her blankly. Even mama Xu, who had brought the soup and was sitting next to her, forgot to put her bowl down as her mouth opened in shock.</p>
<p>It was mainly because of the way Yu Yaoyao was eating now.</p>
<p><i>It smells so good! </i></p>
<p>Her face’s attractiveness was already beyond average, especially framed by her pair of clear eyes. Now when she bit off the vegetables one by one, those eyes shined like stars in the night sky, suddenly lighting up her whole face, her delicate skin exuding a charming luster.</p>
<p>What made the little bun and mama Xu even more fascinated is that with every mouthful she ate, Yu Yaoyao seems to have eaten the most delicious food in the world. With her bulging cheeks chewing fast and intoxicated eyes, she looked like some kind of small animal.</p>
<p>It’s actually kind of cute.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the little bun could not help but pick up his own fork, he took up the carrot, the vegetable he hated most, and following after how his mother did it, swallowed it in one mouthful. He closed his mouth agonizingly and chewed vigorously, copying his mother—as if the carrots weren’t so bad.</p>
<p>“Mama Xu, your cooking is so good ~ this is the most delicious food I have ever eaten in my whole life!” Yu Yaoyao contentedly put the empty bowl on the table and gave mama Xu a big thumbs up.</p>
<p>Mama Xu blushed in an instant, hurriedly putting down her bowl of soup, she shook her hands nervously. “Madam, what are you joking for? My craftsmanship is only mediocre; it can’t even compare with the food offered by the restaurants outside.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, however, happily filled her empty bowl with chicken soup and drank it all at once.</p>
<p><i>Ah</i>, she could only utter in bliss. She could not help but stuff her throat with the tasty dishes!</p>
<p>“Mama Xu, don’t be modest!”</p>
<p>“I’ve been in this hospital for two days and will be discharged in a short while. When I go home, I’ll surely be craving your cooking. It’s that delicious!”</p>
<p>What she said was not an exaggeration at all. While she had lived as a snake before, she only ate raw food in the zoo. And it was meat that had gone bad, and no longer safe to eat! When she had watched those idol reality tv shows, she felt that the actors in those videos were eating food for divine beings!</p>
<p>And now that she had become human, she had wanted to have a taste of those culinary dishes too. But with everything that has happened, she was always derailed.</p>
<p>Today, she finally ate her first meal as a human! And it was even more delicious than her wildest imaginations that it made her want to cry!</p>
<p>“This chicken is smooth and sweet. I’ve never eaten anything so delicious!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s genuine expression made Mama Xu stay. Previously, the madam had always been picky with her cooking skills.</p>
<p>“Mama Xu, can I have another bowl of yesterday evening’s pudding?” Yu Yaoyao clasped her hands, her eyes sparkling. “If it’s too troublesome, will tomorrow evening be alright?”</p>
<p>“Or is there anything I can do to help?” She belatedly added.</p>
<p>Mama Xu was even more frightened. “If the madam likes it. I can make one every day.”</p>
<p>Clearly, the madam used to easily get very angry with her. Now… she heard that she hit her head on the bed?</p>
<p>“You are such a good person!” Yu Yaoyao waved briskly. “I’ll tell the father of this little bun to give you a raise!”</p>
<p>Compared with what her life used to be, today was her first day of heaven.</p>
