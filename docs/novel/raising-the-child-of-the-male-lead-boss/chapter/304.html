            <p><strong>Chapter 459</strong></p>
<p>“Darling, what do you think?” Yu Yaoyao was coquettish as she spoke over her mobile phone.</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s breathing almost stopped. It felt like she had come up with a big show without even knowing it.</p>
<p>Was this still ‘Welcome to My Home’? Although she had always felt something was not right, she was completely unable to refute. When Yaoyao said she would help Mr. Shen in training the rookie, why did it sound so exciting when it was obviously still an idea?</p>
<p>It felt like she had bought a lottery ticket that she would surely win, and that she was just waiting for the lottery!</p>
<p>A team of a husband and wife that’s building a star empire? Ye Yun’s brain moved quickly. In the blink of an eye, she had already come up with several different implementation plans when Yu Yaoyao was still on the phone. She was even beginning to analyse the feasibility and the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to write it down with a pen, so that she could discuss it with Yaoyao later, she heard Yaoyao’s voice on the phone.</p>
<p>“Huh? Why can’t we do it, darling?” she said. “Why not?”</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s heart also lifted. Why can’t they do such an interesting project? What a pity!</p>
<p>“Huh? It doesn’t match the theme of “Welcome to My Home”?” Yu Yaoyao’s tone sounded a little regretful. “So, we can only showcase the day-to-day stuff?”</p>
<p>Ye Yun also sighed. Indeed, she had also thought of this fatal point just now. It was just that she had totally ignored this under the excitement. If this warm family variety show turned into a talent show, the audience would definitely think that the program team was purposely misleading them. Even the audience who weren’t fans of Yu Yaoyao would think that she was trying too hard to make money and gain popularity when she was supposed to be breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Ye Yun could only give up. However, she still continued to improve some brainstorm ideas she had written down. Even if they couldn’t be used on this variety show, didn’t Guangxin also have the ability to invest and lead a new type of program for cultivating the newbies?</p>
<p>She wrote down everything that came to her mind so that she could later organize them into project documents. She planned to present this to Mr. Shen and General Manager Liu of the Strategy Department to review.</p>
<p>Ye Yun was very rational. Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao was still trying to persuade Shen Yichong, “Husband, then what should I do? Xiao Yunyun said that I can help people realize their dreams, but now I can’t?”</p>
<p>Although Ye Yu wasn’t sure what Shen Yichong had said on the other end of the phone, she heard Yu Yaoyao let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“Fine then…” she sighed. “You can continue your meeting.” Yu Yaoyao hung up the phone and looked at Ye Yun pitifully. “He said no. The training program for the trainees can be done separately, but it cannot be carried out in this program of Director Zhao.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun was simply fascinated by her soft expression. But she had the same thought as Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“That’s okay. Let’s think about something else. We can start with your usual hobbies.” Ye Yun guided her in a soft voice. After speaking, she immediately listed Yaoyao’s interests. “You like food and snacks Also, you like watching TV, being lazy, and dressing yourself up.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded after every sentence she said. As one of the top fans, Ye Yun really knew Yu Yaoyao very well. It didn’t take long for Ye Yun to realize that Yaoyao’s interests were all very ordinary.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for her being unable to go out during breastfeeding, even opening a small cafe during the show would be very good. Just with her favourite desserts, a TV hanging in the store, she would get to have a chat on the sofa with many customers who came to the store.</p>
<p>Ye Yun opened her mouth wide. She immediately picked up the pen again and wrote it down.</p>
<p>This was also a good idea! How did she get such a talent for the entertainment industry? She could come up with such a good project just by simply suggesting anything!</p>
<p>Ye Yun immediately told Yu Yaoyao some of her thoughts. As a fan, she can understand the mentality and grasp the psychology of most of the audience very well. The content of the program she came up with was quite interesting.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes flickered as soon as she heard Ye Yun’s thoughts. But they soon darkened again. “I can’t have desserts for this period of time. Especially coffee and chocolate.”</p>
<p>Of course, Ye Yun almost forgot. Desserts were not allowed during the breastfeeding period. Mothers are afraid the child might also drink caffeine from them and have trouble sleeping.</p>
<p>Ye Yun nodded understandingly, “These can only be tried later.” But as soon as she finished speaking, her eyes lit up. They were full of anticipation and longing like when she wanted to touch Little Bun just now.</p>
<p>“Sister yao, didn’t you make a barbecue for the crew of ‘Invincible Youth’ last time? You also distributed the food to the fans at the scene?”</p>
<p>As Ye Yun spoke, her mind suddenly became clearer!</p>
<p>The golden roasted wings that showed up on the screen immediately flashed in front of her eyes! She craved it! She also wants to try the barbecue made by Yaoyao herself!</p>
<p>There were rumours that said that all the little girls who went to the scene that day all had their share. She even saw someone posted photos in the group. It would be false to say that she was not envious.</p>
<p>Ye Yun drooled just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Of course, some people in the group also said it didn’t taste good, but she totally ignored it. The taste was not important, rather, it was the person who grilled the chicken!</p>
<p>“Sister Yao, would you like to make some snacks for everyone in these episodes of this show? It wouldn’t matter even if it doesn’t taste good,” Ye Yun began. “You can cook it at home and have Mr. Shen and Little Bun sell it like streetfood. Maybe using a truck similar to an ice cream truck, that way they can drive and sell everywhere.” The more Ye Yun spoke, the more excited she became.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t they be all cold then?” Yu Yaoyao, who originally ate only raw and cold food, now loves hot food. She was now convinced that food must be warm to be delicious.</p>
<p>“They can be reheated,” Ye Yun hurriedly suggested. “We could also get some insulation.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun remembered the small vendors near her school before. Those who sold fried tofu prepared them in advance, and the food was warmed or cooked when a customer ordered.</p>
<p>“In this way, the program group can continue the live broadcast. It would broadcast your cooking and the sales process of Mr. Shen. They can also end work early if the food is all sold out!” Ye Yun excitedly chimed. “The guests can also help out.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui came over just before Yu Yaoyao could reply and said, “Sure!”</p>
<p>“We could also share the process of my mommy learning to cook. My mommy still needs to have her cooking skills brushed up. She still has to learn from my dad and practice more!” he blabbered, obviously enthused by the idea.</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s eyes brightened. Through this, the audience can see the sweet interactions between the husband and wife!</p>
