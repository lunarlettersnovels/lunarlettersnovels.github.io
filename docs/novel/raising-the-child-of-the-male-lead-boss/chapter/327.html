<p><strong>Chapter 436</strong></p>
<p>Everyone wished they could listen in, as they were all very anxious. The award ceremony that followed had nothing to do with YY fans. They didn’t even realize when the ceremony was coming to an end. They were all devoted to the affairs of Little Bun, Yaoyao, and the second baby.</p>
<p>The live broadcast channel for the awards suddenly lost a half of its popularity. Many people went to Yu Yaoyao’s official page to give various blessings to her baby.</p>
<p>Finally, at one o’clock in the morning, when Mother Liu, an early education teacher with five years of experience, was on the call with Little Bun, she heard a noise on the other side of the phone.</p>
<p>Then, she heard Little Bun’s surprise cry. “Little sister is out! Auntie, my little sister is out!”</p>
<p>The cry of the little baby suddenly reached the ears of this Mother Liu, a YY fan, over the phone.</p>
<p>She immediately shed tears with excitement, as if she had also given birth to a second child, “Baby Rui, what did the doctor say?”</p>
<p>“Auntie, the doctor said both the mother and daughter are safe, and my sister weighs as much as six pounds!”</p>
<p>“Wow! What a little one!”</p>
<p>Little Bun’s excited news soon spread to the fans. Yu Yaoyao was suffering until early morning, and Little Bun also refused to sleep because of that.</p>
<p>The loyal fans had been with him all the time. The fans who had preschool education experience were lined up to call him. They were even afraid that his throat would be uncomfortable after a long conversation, so they told him not to speak during the whole process. They also shared stories and tips to take care of his sister with him. Other fans who didn’t get to talk to him on the phone were envious. With that, the last few calls were recorded with the consent of the caller, and they were shared in the fan group.</p>
<p>Although Little Bun did not speak much, everyone was still extremely happy. Especially the last one. Learning the birth of the baby from the recording made the fans revel. Other than emojis and short blessings, the president, vice president, and fan administrators sent red envelopes to celebrate. Although it was late at night, the group was very lively.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yu Yaoyao, who didn’t know that so much had happened, was looking at her new Bun with a pair of red eyes. The little girl was all pinkish. Her hands were thin, and her fingers were a little wrinkled.</p>
<p>She shed tears instantly, and she couldn’t stop it. Shen Yichong wiped her tears and comforted her while holding her hand. But even Yu Yaoyao didn’t know why she was crying, maybe she almost died in pain just now! She didn’t even know that it hurt so much for human beings to give birth to babies. In fact, she also didn’t know whether it was painful for the snake clan to give birth to a baby.</p>
<p>But what she just went through just now…was purely tormenting! Ever since the beginning of the award ceremony, she felt that her stomach was heavy, and her back was aching. Feeling something was not right, she asked Shen Yichong to send her to the hospital.</p>
<p>Who knew that she would already be screaming in pain before they even reached the hospital.</p>
<p>“Darling, why isn’t a man giving birth to a child? It’s so unfair… If I knew this earlier, I would give birth to a son instead of a daughter. I’m sad thinking that she would also have to suffer this much in the future,” she said. “Everyone likes to criticize women for being materialistic. Obviously, giving birth to a baby is much harder than making money! I would rather give out 100 million so that you can give birth to a baby for me.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, “You are tired, take a good rest. We won’t give birth to another baby, okay?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sniffled, bulging her cheeks, “Then 300 million!”</p>
<p>As she was pushed out of the delivery room, she soon saw Little Bun who had been waiting outside. When Shen Rui finally saw his mommy, his worry and nervousness were finally gone completely. His tears rushed out.</p>
<p>“Mommy… right! We can ask daddy to give birth to a baby in the future. We won’t give birth to another baby! Mommy was in pain. Daddy can bear all the pain in the future!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>The call was still ongoing, and the the fans could still hear what they were saying.</p>
<p>After Shen Yichong happily became a father, he also had mixed feelings from the expectation he had after learning he was going to become a father again. There was nervousness and distress for Yu Yaoyao and finally, joy when the baby was born. Although it was early morning, he still didn’t feel sleepy.</p>
<p>After coaxing Yu Yaoyao to sleep and sending Shen Rui to bed that was temporarily set up in the exclusive ward, Shen Yichong looked at his little girl foolishly all night. Other than waking Yu Yaoyao up to feed the baby in the middle of the night, he, as a father, took care of all other things by himself.</p>
<p>The little girl’s sleeping position, random noises, small fingers squeezed into a fist…All of these were extremely cute and beautiful for him. He just couldn’t see enough.</p>
<p>At dawn, Shen Yichong finally became more sober and withdrew from the excitement of being a father for the second time.</p>
<p>Only then did he remember that he should go online and tell the friends and fans who cared for their family the safe arrival of their second baby.</p>
<p>After going online, Shen Yichong found that his wife had won two awards. This topic was ranked on the eighth most searched topic, but an unrelated topic was in the second rank, second only to the newly released hot topic of the best actor and actress.</p>
<p><em>#CallsWithBun#</em></p>
<p>It was a very ordinary hot search title. You wouldn’t know what it was without clicking on it.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong’s eyelids were jumping. He suddenly thought of the cell phone his son was holding when they got out of the delivery room… There was a sudden thud in his heart, and he had a bad premonition!</p></div>
