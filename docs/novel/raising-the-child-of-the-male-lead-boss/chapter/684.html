            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 67 – A Sly Underdog</strong></p>
<p>Many people were curious about the beautiful girl in the video. Therefore, they naturally opened the link attached with the video and saw the introductory video for ‘<em>In the Limelight’ </em>and decided to vote for her.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran, who had just relaxed because she was already number one, found herself being overtaken out of the blue. In fury and disbelief, she smashed the screen of her mobile phone on the seats.</p>
<p>“What a shameless woman! Using sponsors to elevate herself up on the ranking! Shameless!”</p>
<p>Her manager also did not expect for their fortunate situation to change abruptly. Yet, he also couldn’t help but sigh in admiration about the slyness of this female actress, Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p><em>She is really too cunning!</em></p>
<p>At first fans from different contestants only came to watch her live broadcast to sprinkle her with dog abuse, but many of them actually became fascinated with her performance that led to them vote.</p>
<p>He also saw her live broadcast on eating potato chips just this morning; contrary to what he was expecting, he actually felt that she performed her scene very well. When she humbly asked to eat the pack of potato chips, it aroused the sympathy of many people because they saw her as a down to earth person.</p>
<p>Only, he didn’t expect her to use this opportunity wisely, that sponsors would immediately take fancy on her just on just the first day of the competition.</p>
<p><em>Indeed, her highlight video is as powerful as any good advertisement!</em></p>
<p>She was beautiful enough, had moving lines and portrayed a rousing pitiful act with just three packs of cheap potato chips. With this her short clip had become the most unusual but promising advertisement!</p>
<p>For such a beautiful woman that would be moved to tears by just eating a bag of potato chips—this is simply boot-licking @<em>Lay’sChinaOfficial</em>!</p>
<p>It was more direct and eye-catching than any rainbow nonsense on the internet!</p>
<p>It’s even more normal that the Lay’s Potato Chip Company will share it. Maybe they even paid for Yu Yaoyao to be on the hot search, which sent her to the first place with just this video! It would naturally be a win-win situation for both, with Lay’s earning a successful advertisement for free.</p>
<p>The manager thought about it deeply, although his face didn’t look good at the moment, he was more than convinced.</p>
<p>“Earlier, I remembered the director saying that you can use any resources inside the room. After the show, many people wanted to show their goodwill to sponsors and tried to film more footage. But she was the only one who has perfectly combined her performance topic of a poor person with the sponsor’s products. Not only is it not too hasty, but her deliverance was very natural and on point, striking a balance between absurdity and seriousness, and earning the hearts of many people in the process.”</p>
<p>The manager shook his head helplessly and could still not get over it. “Little Ran, this is still the preliminary match. It’s okay to temporarily lag behind. We’ll try hard next time.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran bit her lip, “Elder brother Han, don’t you have an account at a fan page of mine? Can you go to the group and say that she…she is using underhanded methods—a shortcut! The way she won is not clean at all; she is just hugging someone else’s thigh!”</p>
<p>The manager was stunned by the crass words coming from Meng Xinran’s mouth, but eventually, after a long time, he sighed and agreed.</p>
<p>But when he opened his phone to visit the fan base, his hands shook seeing the chatting history inside!</p>
<p><em>[Anonymous person #1: I have always liked Ranran, attracted by her lovely nature. But to tell the truth, I think Yu Yaoyao is also a beautiful lady and a modest person. Her performance today doesn’t even fall behind Ranran’s. Therefore, I voted—two for Ranran and one for Yu Yaoyao. I don’t think there is any problem with supporting two women.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Anonymous person #2: From today on, Ranran is my younger sister and YYY is my fairy older sister!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Anonymous person #3: Ranran’s endearing personality makes people want to protect her…meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao’s performance made people’s heart ache.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Anonymous person #4: I agree with the commenter above. As a man, Yu Yaoyao today aroused my desire to protect her.</em> <em>Ranran…dressed as an old man today—to tell the truth, it did not suit her.]</em></p>
<p><em><strong>[Admin has prohibited anonymous chatting within the group.]</strong></em></p>
<p><em>[Admin: Anonymous accounts are not allowed here! Also, a person cannot have two beliefs at the same time. If you are not a devoted fan of Ranran, then don’t stay here!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Admin: I hope everyone will wake up! This fan group will only support Ranran. Voting teams, let’s all cheer up! We must take first place back!]</em></p>
<p>The manager’s eyebrows frowned tightly.</p>
<p><em>Ranran’s fans actually…began to lean towards Yu Yaoyao?</em></p>
<p>He hurriedly hid the screen of his mobile phone screen from the already furious Meng Xinran, fearing that she would lose her temper again.</p>
<p>As an artist, losing fans could be partly due to bad conduct, erroneous announcements, and sometimes…lack of charm. Or in the likely event that more brilliant and powerful artists appear, they became slowly replaced.</p>
<p>This ongoing situation is obviously the latter.</p>
<p>The manager hugged the mobile phone to his heart and frowned anxiously.</p>
