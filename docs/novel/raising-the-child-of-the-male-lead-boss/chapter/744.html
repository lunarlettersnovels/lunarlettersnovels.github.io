            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 7 – She Wants This Little Child (1)</strong></p>
<p>Chen Lin sat with his boss in the ward. He felt as if he was inside a massive ice cave, with cold air coming from his side every second!</p>
<p><i>Boss… has rejected thirteen design programs already!</i></p>
<p>Half an hour ago, Chen Lin had already wanted to escape.</p>
<p>There was a hot topic that sprinted to the ranking in a short time like a sudden force, occupying the top of today’s micro-blog search list!</p>
<p><b><i>#YuYaoyaoDidNotCommitSuicide. HusbandTooStrong!</i></b></p>
<p>Since then, the temperature in the room has not been higher.</p>
<p>“Garbage, let him do it again!”</p>
<p>Chen Lin’s eardrums were shaking! <i>Fourteenth!</i></p>
<p>Chen Lin looked at Shen Yichong’s extremely icy side profile, looking as if every pore was oozing discomfort.</p>
<p>Just as he was finding an excuse to leave, the iPad on the small table next to the sofa vibrated several times. He sneaked a glance and swallowed instantly. It was Boss’ microblog online friends laughing at the current news.</p>
<p><i>— The fastest, most exotic, most compelling face-slapping in history: to kill a person by a laugh! Boss Shen, your wife is one of a kind!</i></p>
<p><i>— Mrs. Shen’s inner monologue: Whoops, this person was pushed down by her husband and was not able to stand back up due to a moment of dizziness. Who committed suicide!? Husband is too fierce… this is also a problem~</i></p>
<p><i>— Boss Shen’s voice: Wife, we better close the door. Say please!</i></p>
<p>With a bang, the dark-faced Shin Yichong almost hit the sofa with a punch! Chen Lin immediately hid in the corner like a quail.</p>
<p>“Give me a cigarette.” Shen Yichong stood up with a husky voice.</p>
<p>“Well, you can’t smoke inside the hospital, Boss—”</p>
<p>Faced with a dagger-like glare, Chen Lin swallowed the second half of the sentence and rushed to hand the cigarette and lighter from his pocket respectfully.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squinted, clipped it between his fingers, and bit the cigarette in his mouth without using the lighter.</p>
<p>He looked up at the snow-white, weak but beautiful woman in the hospital bed, with dark eyes and scowled. “Find out who she’s been in contact within the last month, the flow of bank cards and credit cards.”</p>
<p>“Okay, boss, I’ll go to work first.” Chen Lin opened his mouth and immediately answered.</p>
<p>“Forget it, you don’t have to…” Came Shen Yichong’s tired reply.</p>
<p>“Ah? Boss?”</p>
<p>“You can go out.”</p>
<p>“All right, boss!” Chen Lin did not hesitate at all and fled the room quickly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong waited for the door to close. Afterward, his back which towered like a pine tree walked with extremely slow steps towards the bed, as if it was difficult to make even a little step. He looked down at the woman who buried most of her face in the quilt. At the moment, her eyes were closed, yet her face was still picturesque.</p>
<p>Even the teardrop mole at the corner of her eye was a beautiful contrast against her pale skin—even better than the harsh white of the hospital bedding.</p>
<p>Like a statue, he stood by her side, not knowing how long.</p>
<p>It was not until the sky was dark and the sun rays were faint did Yu Yaoyao woke up.</p>
<p>She did not dare to move the moment she woke up, for fear of the needle still inserted in her hand. However, while her brain was still groggy from sleep, she felt water dripping down the back of her palm.</p>
<p><i>Is it raining?</i></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao opened her eyes.</p>
<p>She used to sleep, coiling herself up and hiding among the leaves. Now she unconsciously covers most of her face with a quilt, covering most of the viewing angle.</p>
<p>At present, she saw a fluffy little black head emerge from the side of her bed. The round and white little face was facing her. The cheeks looked very supple, just like a big pork bun that was smooth, tender, and sweet.</p>
<p>The moment after Yu Yaoyao opened her eyes, two more tears began to fall from the little bun’s face, pattering in a broken line and falling down her hands. But soon the little bun bowed its head and noticed that the back of her hand was wet with tears.</p>
<p>The black eyes widened in fright and immediately turned to peep at Yu Yaoyao’s face with guilt and panic.</p>
