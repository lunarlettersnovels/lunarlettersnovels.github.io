            <p><strong>Chapter 357</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>“Xiao Yao?” Why would Chen Jiao speak Yu Yaoyao like that? “Brother Jiao…” Ling Shuang suddenly felt cold run up her spine. A terrible thought flashed in her mind. Goosebumps rose on her skin, and cold sweat coated her body. It felt as though she had lost feeling in her hands and feet.</p>
<p>Had he discovered the truth? But that was impossible!</p>
<p>“Xiao Yao? Where are you? I can come and meet you now!” Chen Jiao said anxiously when he didn’t get a response.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang trembled, and her whole body almost collapsed again.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, kept a straight face. She withdrew the phone she had held in front of Ling Shuang. She frowned and glanced at the screen.</p>
<p>“Xiao Yao? Comrade Chen Jiao, we are not close. Please don’t call me by my nickname.” This crazy person was trying to drag her into some scandalous mess again. He’d called her by such an affectionate name in front of everyone.</p>
<p>“Um… I’m sorry. I was too forward. I wanted to talk to you about what we used to be when we were younger. I know you have amnesia; but I wanted to tell you that…” Chen Jiao spoke hurriedly, in fear that she would hang up the phone.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s face was already as pale as the dead and sweat was starting to bead on her forehead.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, was calmly pursing her lips. “I don’t want to remember the past… But I am in big trouble right now. I need you to come and sort it out for me.”</p>
<p>“Where are you? I will come right away!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gave Chen Jiao the address. Then she hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Lowering her head, she grinned and looked at the bedraggled Ling Shuang sitting on the ground. “Your brother Chen Jiao never turned off his phone, nor was he unreachable,” her red lips formed the word ‘oops,’ and she coyly covered her mouth with her hand. “Ah! Maybe… He blocked you? I heard that he won’t take your calls or text once he has blocked you.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang was trembling on the ground, unable to utter a word.</p>
<p>“Filming, in the crew? He doesn’t seem to be busy at all. He picked up right away. Don’t blame me for stuff I didn’t do. I called him over to solve all your problems for you,” Yu Yaoyao squinted as she smiled.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong asked Ni Yi to find a café. He booked the suite on the second floor.</p>
<p>His wife’s legs were going to be sore and tired after standing for such a long time, her skin was going to be so tan after a long time in the sun. She was probably going to be thirsty and hungry after talking for most of the day. In one swoop, he was going to solve all these problems.</p>
<p>When Chen Jiao arrived at the address, he saw Yu Yaoyao sitting on the swing on the second floor of the coffee shop. She looked like a little fairy as she sipped at the iced juice. She also had a bunch of tiny cakes in front of her.</p>
<p>Beside her was Shen Yichong, dressed in a suit and leather shoes. He picked up a small walnut, cracked and peeled it, then put it on a plate with others and pushed it in front of her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had a bite of the nuts, and it was obvious she was very much enjoying them.</p>
<p>The couple not only looked outstanding, but they also matched incomparably.</p>
<p>Even though he had watched the recorded “My Wife and I” video, Chen Jiao still felt a sharp pain in his heart when he saw them. For a second, his steps up the stairs faltered.</p>
<p>He calmed himself down. Enduring the feeling in his chest, he walked to the second floor. There, he found the panicking Ling Shuang, whose face was pale and a little swollen. She held her hands clasped tightly as her teeth chattered behind her chapped lips.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao couldn’t help but frown. On the way here, Guo Li had already told him what had happened. He hadn’t expected that the scene Ling Shuang’s group performance was filming that day was near the opening ceremony of Yu Yaoyao’s shooting.</p>
<p>He had been careless!</p>
<p>But Chen Jiao immediately got himself under control. With a smile like that of a brother next door, he walked over to Yu Yaoyao’s coffee table. “Xiao… Yu, long time no see. May I sit here?” as Chen Jiao spoke, he nodded at her in a gentlemanly manner and stretched out his hand to pull the chair.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao raised her head and pointed towards the silent Ling Shuang. “Your seat is there, big brother. Isn’t that your sister over there?”</p>
<p>As soon as she said this, Chen Jiao’s face turned pale. Ling Shuang reached out and touched the cup on the table.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s hand stopped awkwardly in the air.</p>
<p>“Then, let me explain to you what happened, in front of everyone,” he turned his head to look at Ling Shuang with a fierce gaze, but his voice was strangely warm. “Once upon a time, when I had nothing and was hopeless, I met a girl who was as pure as crystal. She was like a match. She reignited the fire in my life, so that I could continue to work hard. I lived by relying on that warmth and light.”</p>
<p>Just the opening of his speech shattered all the self-comfort Ling Shuang had left. She had been holding onto the last glimmer of hope and luck, but now that was gone. She immediately realized that Chen Jiao had found everything out, and that he knew that she was just a substitute in disguise! All the things that had happened recently, the torture that Guo Li had put her through, the two brawny ‘personal assistants’, the changed passwords on her accounts, and these humiliating, ugly group performance… Chen Jiao knew everything… No. He may have been the one who had organized it. He had been lying to her and torturing her for the past few days!</p>
