<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 178 – Yaoyao’s Biggest Fans (2)</strong></p>
<p>Soon, Little Bun, who was hesitating to do it, raised his tablet and took pictures of his Mommy looking beautiful and elegant on the stage. Shen Yichong, who noticed his son’s hesitation affectionately patted his head.</p>
<p>Looking at the stage, Little Bun’s black eyes had a trace of brightness. He really wanted to yell loudly for his Mommy to notice him once again, but his Daddy forbade it.</p>
<p>Because today, Yu Yaoyao, who was standing on the stage, had become the pride of his son. Even though he was still young… he had established the fact that his mother was his pride.</p>
<p>On the stage, only two Guangxin artists were left. And it was without a doubt that Yu Yaoyao was the most dazzling one, like a beam of light, making the whole dark place alive with just her radiant appearance.</p>
<p>The host soon interviewed the remaining contestants, heightening the tension and heat in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>“What do you think of your earlier performance? Do you feel confident about winning the place of this competition?”</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian who was standing in the first place, smiled at the little girl next to him, and then looked at Yu Yaoyao who was standing not too far away from him.</p>
<p>“I guess I performed well. If you’re a man, you can’t say you didn’t do well.”</p>
<p>Each contestant had no idea of how the others had performed, so they couldn’t judge one another based on the current ranking.</p>
<p>“Who do you think is your biggest opponent?” asked the host, heating up the atmosphere to the highest level.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian smiled bitterly. “For the past few episodes I have been constantly second to one person. Who do you think that is?”</p>
<p>The host and the audience laughed.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian scratched the back of his head. “The fans have high hopes for me, but to be honest, I have gained five pounds since I participated in this show, and have eaten more than a dozen packets of potato chips… and then pudding… anyways, a certain contestant is dangerous.”</p>
<p>He glanced at Yu Yaoyao, who was at the bottom of the ranking, with a grieving look. “It is certainly great to get the first place today but if she can’t get it, then that’s fine. I just hope she doesn’t let me see her eating food the next time. Thank you.”</p>
<p>The laughter from the audience suddenly intensified. Even the judges laughed at his statement. Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao seemed to be innocent and unbothered as if what Qiu Dajian said had nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>The host asked questions one by one and finally arrived at Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“I think I am number one.”</p>
<p>She was not humble at all and was not afraid to speak her mind.</p>
<p>The host choked at her sudden bluntness. “So confident, huh?”</p>
<p>“Well, of course.” Yu Yaoyao pulled out an extremely bright smile, enough to blind the audience looking at her.</p>
<p>She wanted to be on the stage, wanted to perform in front of the camera; she was obsessed with the feeling of being watched… for nearly a century!  The years of such obsession were even longer than any of the other contestants at this moment now!</p>
<p>When she was bored, she would look at the tourists’ behavior and expressions, listening to their tempers; the tone of joy or frustration… In terms of the control of tone and expressions, she felt that she had the same capabilities as that of a trained human!</p>
<p>“I will be the first.” She grabbed the microphone from the host and refused to stay still.</p>
<p>She looked at Shen Yichong who was holding the little bun.</p>
<p>“I promised my husband that I will bring home the bacon. In order to eat at a big lobster buffet tonight, I only ate a chicken leg during lunch…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was focused on the camera, the corners of his mouth suddenly twitched.</p>
<p>No one knew how to react. The host gave the judges the time to regain their composure.</p>
<p>“Our live broadcast voting will be closed within ten minutes,” he said, “During this period, let us first listen to the comprehensive evaluation of the judges.”</p>
<p>First of all, the veteran speaker Shao Qing gave his critics. Despite the few wrinkles on his face, he was still active in various action dramas and played various fatherly roles on television. He flashed a kind smile in front of the camera.</p>
<p>“This will be my last, after judging dozens of competitions, big or small, I just want to say… all the contestants who showed their skills and talents were excellent. But for today’s performance, I would like to thank one contestant in particular.”</p>
<p>“I have been in the entertainment industry for 26 years. Most of the time, I am performing based on experience and memory, and unconsciously losing the passion to perform.”</p>
<p>He paused, spread out his palm, and pointed at Yu Yaoyao on the stage.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, I want to thank you in particular. Your performance today made me see what I truly love, my heart truly belongs in drama. Your performance, from the beginning to the end, in my opinion, even if there were flaws, has surpassed many old actors in the industry and even popular actors.”</p>
<p>“I hope that I will have the opportunity to work with you in the future. It might be very enjoyable and refreshing to be with you on the set,” Shiao Qing said, smiled tenderly, and put down the microphone.</p>
<p>But not long after, he picked it up again. “I heard that the YYY fandom is very popular now. If you don’t mind, I want to be able to play your father in the future. Is it okay?”</p>
<p>The audience became very noisy. Even the YYY fans in the live broadcast were silent for a moment before flooding the comment section once again.</p>
<p><strong>[Ah, Shiao Qing was a great actor ten years ago!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Who dares to say that my sister’s acting is not good, bow down your head!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Straighten up my posture, I’m proud to be a YYY fan. In the future, I will call Shao Qing ‘dad’.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Sister Y, Aw, I am proud of you!]</strong></p>
<p>Chen Jiao took advantage of this upsurge and picked up the microphone.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s performance was very good today, and many of you already have the skills and talent to perform in front of the camera.”</p>
<p>“But… I’m of the same opinion as senior Shiao Qing. Today, Ms. Yu’s performance has impressed me so much that I can’t stop thinking of competing with her.” As he spoke, the audience screamed again and again.</p>
<p>The peach-blossom eyed Chen Jiao had attracted the souls of too many girls, just a smile could make them giggle and remain in awe for a long time. Not to mention, he said he would compete with Yu Yaoyao on the same stage.</p>
<p>However, Shen Yichong in the family area frowned directly after hearing this sentence.</p>
<p><em>Miss Yu?!</em></p>
