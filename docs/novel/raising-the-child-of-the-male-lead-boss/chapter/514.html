            <p><strong>Chapter 249 – My Husband Was Kidnapped?! (2)</strong></p>
<p>The fans, who had been in rage before, found the situation hilarious. It did more to increase their liking for Yu Yaoyao than before. This was good news for Gu Qianqian, who was also scrolling through her phone trying to keep up with the situation. She found that her name had been buried underneath all the absurdity and not one mention of her name could be seen.  She was finally relieved enough to accept a few requests for an interview.</p>
<p>She had always kept away from the media but she accepted a couple of requests this time, hoping that she could clarify anything that they might have a question regarding today’s situation. Gu Qianqian breathed a little freely.</p>
<p>“Sis Qianqian, the person from <em>Excellent Diamond</em> wants to talk to you…,” one of them suggested.</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian rejected it without hesitation, “I’m not taking it.” They had the audacity to request an interview! When they went after Yu Yaoyao with their endorsement, she didn’t bother them. And now, they turn to her? She wasn’t having some leftover rejected by someone else.</p>
<p>“Xiaomei, no matter how high a price they offer, I don’t want to work for them. Blacklist them for the future,” she said on the phone. Gu Qianqian hung up and turned to her agent. “By the way, isn’t the company trying to get me to endorse some product from a luxury brand? Any updates?”</p>
<p>Her agent, He Meijia, looked at her schedule. “We already have three brands to choose from, including <em>Light Luxury</em>. They have all sponsored dresses and jewelries for us before. They expressed a willingness to cooperate, but are negotiating. <em>Adole</em> would be ideal for us, their reputation is good and they are popular.” Meijia added, “The company is negotiating a three-year contract. It seems they quite like you.”</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian was pleased hearing this. “Three years? Are there other competitors?”</p>
<p>“The Chief Executive of China sector will be attending a fashion show next week with the Chief Designer. They might discuss the specific terms then. We heard that there might be other competitors but they are looking for more youthful personalities. I think your charm of maturity and elegance are more suited to <em>Adole.</em>”</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian nodded. She had debuted for a long time, but rarely took endorsements. The company had been trying to keep her a mystery and had been marketing more on her acting skills. That was why her image wasn’t related to products much. She realised that she had let slip many opportunities, but this time, she wanted to fight for the endorsements coming her way. <em>Light Luxury</em> was a good start. Most movie actors and actresses looked down on it so it would be easier to seize the opportunity. After she won an award this year or the next, she could then compete for the high-end luxury lines.</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian was in a good mood. She had almost gotten over the morning’s incident. “Xiaomei, you may go and rest. I am going to go have lunch after this,” she said to her assistant.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>In the meantime, Yu Yaoyao finished her last scene and almost caused the Director a heart attack. Director Zhou dragged her to check several other scenes. When Zhou Qiu was satisfied that the scenes were okay, he angrily indicated to Yu Yaoyao to go for lunch. “Go, it’s your turn to have lunch. Next time, give me a heads up if you are carrying any sort of ‘baby’. If you do it again, I might just retire because of all the fuss from the media and the stress.” Although he sounded annoyed, the staff laughed it off. There was always rushing and pressure in the industry, and only seldom fun. So they realized how precious Yu Yaoyao was, with her clumsiness and harmless blunders.</p>
<p>The staff, along with the director and the deputy director came to bid her goodbye at the entrance. Yu Yaoyao, holding her son, abruptly stopped. “Little Bun, where’s your daddy?”</p>
<p>Little Bun raised his head, thinking. He said, “Daddy said he wanted to get some air, so he left me with you, mommy.” Yu Yaoyao went back inside to look for Shen Yichong with her son. The staff saw her come in and laughed when they learnt of the situation.</p>
<p>However, a man in a black mask covering his face approached her and handed her a black card. “It’s an Urgent Wife Mission,” he said.</p>
<p><em>Was this some kind of joke? </em>she thought.</p>
<p>“We have kidnapped your husband,” the man in the mask continued, “You need to find him within 48 hours, otherwise it will be a failed mission and there is no saying what will happen to your husband. This will be broadcasted live on the internet.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stared at him, dumbfounded.</p>
