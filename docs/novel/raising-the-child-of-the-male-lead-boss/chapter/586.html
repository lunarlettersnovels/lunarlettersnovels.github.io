            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 167 – A Learning Husband (1)</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong reached out for the doll that Yu Yaoyao was holding and roughly tossed it inside the box, he felt appalled by the idea of receiving such a gift.</p>
<p>“The finale of ‘In the Limelight’ will be filmed next week, right? Are you ready for it?” Shen Yichong asked, changing the topic.</p>
<p>“You are already thinking about getting the first place and had the idea of appearing as the female lead in an online drama. Yet, you are still not done with your preparations!”</p>
<p>Her cheeks suddenly puffed at her husband’s <em><strong>thoughtful</strong></em> words.</p>
<p>“I’m confident that my beauty can handle all the challenges… but Husband, please be gentle with Yaoyao No. 2, it’s very expensive. That’s equivalent to lots of snacks!”</p>
<p>His lips twitched and ignored the latter half of her sentence. After all, money was not an issue for him.</p>
<p>“Okay, the production staff will be our witness. If you don’t end up getting the first place, your portion of the snacks in the future will be halved.”</p>
<p></p><center><sup>Chapter By WordExcerpt</sup></center><p></p>
<div data-fuse="22037242891"></div>
<p> </p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was flustered, Shen Yichong’s lips turned slightly upward.</p>
<p>“Failure means that your beauty is insufficient and therefore you have no right to eat every snack you want. Eating too much will only make you fatter and your appearance unlikable. You will not look beautiful anymore.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was shocked.</p>
<p>“No… ah!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong turned around and walked out of the study. He gritted his teeth a bit and said, “I will also give you a gift same as the one you gave me. Only if you get the first place… but if not, then don’t think about it.</p>
<p>She slobbered and followed him, reaching out, grabbing the corner of his clothes.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong paused as he felt his clothes being pulled from behind. Looking back, he stared at her slender fingers and his lips curled up.</p>
<p>“Stand up, I’ll take you to an Australian Lobster Buffet. Eat until you’re satiated and no longer want to eat.”</p>
<p>Her lips parted, eyes brightened.</p>
<p><em>Lobsters…</em></p>
<p>She’d only seen it on TV and had never eaten it before… one of the things on her bucket list that she’d always wanted to have after being reincarnated!</p>
<p>“I’ll get ready first!” Yu Yaoyao jumped up quickly!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s pulled down his lips. “But you have to consider Zhou Lin’s drama, the contract says that the weight should not be more than 100 pounds. If it exceeds, we will not go.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao shouted, this was so wrong.</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>But he’s already out of the study. After seeing him enter the bedroom, she quickly walked into the living room.</p>
<p>This was a rare occasion! She didn’t steal any snacks this time. What her husband said must be bothering her.</p>
<p>Soon, out of guilty conscience, she brought out the weighing scale under the bed, took off her shoes silently as well as her knitted jacket.</p>
<p>“I won’t get fat… There are no fat snakes around the world, I am neither fat nor fat…”</p>
<p>She kept on babbling. She was standing on the scale and covered her face with her hands, only revealing a gap between her fingers, to sneak a peek at the number.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath! One cameraman, who’d followed her, quickly turned over the lens to the numbers that appeared, then switched to Yu Yaoyao to closely record her expression.</p>
<p>Her beautiful face collapsed.</p>
<p><em>100.1?… I exceeded by 0.1! No way!</em></p>
<p>Dumbfounded Yu Yaoyao walked down the scale with grief and weighed herself again.</p>
<p>“Well, this scale is broken.” She concluded. “I’m not fat, I can’t be fat…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao decided to ignore this misfortune and uplifted her spirits instead. But soon, Shen Yichong, who came out of the bathroom with wet hair, suddenly appeared behind her.</p>
<p>“Overweight.” He glanced at the weighing scale and ruthlessly pronounced the verdict.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao: “!” She quickly covered her small face and then touched her body. “No… way!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smirked. “The scale is not broken.”</p>
<p>“Aw, husband.” She looked up pitifully. “My body is… still in its developing stage. My chest is just big… not fat! Really! Believe me, try touching it!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face immediately dimmed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>The trailer for the second issue of “My Wife and I” was soon posted online. The program crew especially released Yu Yaoyao’s clips where she was forced by Shen Yichong to prepare herself for the upcoming finale of ‘In the Limelight’. Because of this, the live stage finals of the variety show caught the attention of the public and was pushed to the hot spot.</p>
<p>Many loyal on-screen couple fans of “My Wife and I” waited for days and watched the trailer. All of them wailed for the teaser to play. Not a moment later after the trailer was shown, spoof edits spread online.</p>
<p><strong>[YYY: Dad, I know I’m wrong, please don’t be angry.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen: A merciless heart.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Little Bun: I refuse to accept this; I want to appear!]</strong></p>
<p>In addition, Yu Yaoyao fans couldn’t help but cheer for her in her upcoming finals competition.</p>
<p><strong>[Good luck YYY! I’ll look forward to the finals’ live broadcast!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[My sister YY will surely win first place! Professional actress! I want to see her perform live!]</strong></p>
<p>However, under the general situation, there were also some netizens with doubts. They didn’t hesitate to shower their hatred.</p>
<p><strong>[The previous episodes were all edited out, who knows maybe they are cheating!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[She may have revealed how untalented she is during the live broadcast!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I’m wondering, what challenge the production crew will come up with this time, perhaps it’s called beauty eating snacks, to let her get the first place properly, it’s a default!]</strong></p>
<p>Despite all the negative feedback, they still couldn’t change the fact that she was included in the final 12 of ‘In the Limelight’. In this competition, 500 live audience and three professional judges would vote. In addition, the final phase would also conduct off-site voting.</p>
<p>A week before the live broadcasting, Shen Yichong received an invitation letter from the program team. But he decided not to go because he didn’t want to put more pressure on his wife.</p>
<p>However, Shen Rui, without fail,  asked them every day before bed.</p>
<p>“Mom, how far is the competition?”</p>
<p>“Dad, you haven’t lost the invitation letter, right?”</p>
<p>“Dad, do I need to bring my little stool? So that I can see mommy… ”</p>
<p>Little Bun knew that he was very small and wouldn’t be able to see his Mommy inside the auditorium. There was also a time when he put his toy telescope in his specially prepared small bag and packed up various snacks that his Mommy really liked.</p>
<p>“If Mommy is hungry while filming then I will give Mommy everything that’s in my bag, small pudding and also a strawberry shortcake.”</p>
<p>“If Mommy is tired, I’ve prepared my favorite large white snake which she can lean on. Daddy’s arm is also ready!”</p>
<p>“If Mommy is thirsty, she can use my Tiger paper cup to drink her favorite watermelon juice!!!”</p>
<p>Little Bun turned over to his dad and a ‘Daddy, look! what is missing?’ was written on his tiny face.  Shen Yichong no longer knew what to say to his kid.</p>
