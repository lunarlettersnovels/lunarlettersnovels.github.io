            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 40 – A Happy Family</strong></p>
<p>“I was just about to tell Madam Shen that she has made great progress in acting. And I thought about it—in the future I want to work with her more; in my next project she should come and audition.”</p>
<p>He saw the different acting between Yu Yaoyao and Meng Xinran.</p>
<p>He was deeply shocked with her expression of hate, fierceness, despair and grief. It was like drinking a cup of spicy, white wine. A delicious treat!</p>
<p>Now, when he looked towards the faces of the other actresses in the show, it was bland as water, not a hint of an explosive taste.</p>
<p>None!</p>
<p>Li Bo did not find this kind of exuberant feeling in the lead actress and the villainess.</p>
<p>He doesn’t like it!</p>
<p>But this was the only part she had on this project, and therefore he can only work with her together another time.</p>
<p>“I’ll talk with Guangxin entertainment about this matter later.”</p>
<p>Li Bo felt a pain in his heart when he said this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, next to him is Ni Yi, who was so surprised that his little eyes almost burst out.</p>
<p>But then he was really excited and flushed, “Director Li, are you for real? For the screen test, you should look for me! When can we get the notice?”</p>
<p>With that outburst, he belatedly realized that he had cut in.</p>
<p>He gave an embarrassed smile, and almost hit his own mouth. “Look at me in such a hurry. Director Li, here is my business card. If you have decided, you can contact me directly.”</p>
<p>Li Bo simply smiled, took the business card and nodded.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at Yu Yaoyao in silence and found that she was happily holding the little hand of Shen Rui the steamed bun, blowing kisses several times that made the steamed bun blush.</p>
<p>But then the corners of his mouth subconsciously turned upwards, and his eyes became deeper.</p>
<p>“I troubled Director Li, coming in an unexpected time. Let my assistant buy some drinks and supper for everyone. Everyone has worked hard.”</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong finished talking, he found his son in his arms leaning like the tower of Pisa, always tilting towards Yu Yaoyao’s direction.</p>
<p>The steamed bun’s chubby snow-white face now had little, pink cheeks, as he couldn’t wait to lean towards her.</p>
<p>“Mommy, little Ruirui missed you today, too.”</p>
<p>He heard his mommy say he misses him! And every hour, mommy thinks of him!</p>
<p>His whole little head, which was excited to fall into her arms, was caught just in time by his father’s hand.</p>
<p>“Let mom change first.” Shen Yichong was submerged in an artic aura once more as he looked down at Yu Yaoyao’s Chinese garb.</p>
<p>It was an ancient and conservative dress. All the places that should be covered were blocked only showing hints of skin. But on this woman, her dress managed to exude a hint of a lazy temptation.</p>
<p>The more hidden the treasures are, the more people want to snoop around.</p>
<p>He stood on his side and blocked the view of the numerous men who were focused on her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt the displeasure coming out from his body, but she only wrinkled her little nose.</p>
<p><em>Tsk. This man is too hard to thaw.</em></p>
<p>Even in the full view of everyone, he still was so ferocious to her. She had just said she missed him!</p>
<p>“Husband ~ look at you. <em>Rawr</em>.” She stood on her tiptoes with a naughty smile and gave him a loud smack on his hard chin.</p>
<p>“There are so many people here, don’t be afraid! They won’t laugh at you! Just wait for me.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong froze.</p>
<p>Director Li also understood in seconds, showing a tacit smile between men, “Well, I’ll try not to film until night for madam Shen in the future.”</p>
<p>Rumors truly can’t be trusted. Just look at the harmonious feelings between husband and wife! It was only a few hours that the shoot commenced, and they already want to go home in a hurry!</p>
<p>And what do they want to do at home?</p>
<p>There’s no need to say it!</p>
