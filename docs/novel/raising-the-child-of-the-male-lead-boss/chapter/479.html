            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 284 – Persistent (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Her dreams and fancies were interrupted as Director Ma introduced them. “Mr. Shen let me introduce you to Ling Shuang,” he said, gesturing towards her. “She has worked with me once before. She is the most apt candidate for this role, in my opinion. I have seen her in front of the camera. She is a natural at acting. We wanted new faces for the drama, so Ling Shuang was a perfect fit. She is also an ambitious and hard-working woman. She has pestered me with so many questions for the role, which I highly appreciate.” He chuckled.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked politely at Ling Shuang, out of courtesy. Yu Yaoyao, meanwhile, was listening attentively until she heard her name. She had almost not recognized her. She looked at Ling Shuang, following Shen Yichong’s gaze with distaste. Ling Shuang was wearing a white dress and classic white sneakers with her long, silky black hair swaying at her waist. She did look cute.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had also selected a white dress for this occasion, albeit from Chanel, with expensive embroidery. She disliked wearing white because in every novel she had read, the woman in the white dress had always turned out to be the villain. Which was a stupid reason to dislike a dress, she realized. But she just didn’t prefer the colour. However, she had chosen this white dress on the insistence of Xiao Sisi.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, after the bout of distaste that she felt, looked amused on seeing Ling Shuang falter in uncertainty. The tension was electric. Director Ma cleared his throat. He had heard a lot about Yu Yaoyao. Seeing her in person had certainly been pleasant. “I am a fool, forgive me. Mr. Shen, I have heard that your wife is also a formidable actress,” he looked at Yu Yaoyao with a pleasant smile, “Ms Yu Yaoyao, are you interested in any of the roles in this drama?”</p>
<p>Director Ma’s words left a bitter taste in Ling Shuang’s mouth. His words, which were full of praise, now meant nothing when it was all directed to Yu Yaoyao. She felt disgusted.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled back. “I would have been honored to be a part of your drama, Director,” she said, “But unfortunately, my schedule has been packed. Loss on my part, I am sure.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled. “Yu Yaoyao is here to take a look and learn,” he said affectionately, “Her schedule is already full of other roles. But thank you for the offer.” He held her hand tenderly as he said this and made his way into the audition room with her, without another glance towards Ling Shuang. Director Ma followed.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang felt like it only took seconds from being praised as a talented new actress to being ignored. She gritted her teeth and extended a hand to stop the door from shutting.</p>
<p>“President Shen,” she said, “Can I be the first to audition? I have always admired you; it is an absolute pleasure to have met you today. Although many people have questioned your decision on divesting capitals in ‘Allure’, I have always believed that your choice was a good call. I am deeply honored to try the role in a drama that you invested in.”</p>
<p>Yu yaoyao turned her head to the side and made a barfing face. In the original novel, Ling Shuang had approached Shen Yichong, when he had been lost and depressed after his wife’s suicide. She had comforted and encouraged him to feel love again. But right now, right here, Shen Yichong’s ‘wife’ wasn’t dead. So, it did nothing to lessen the dislike that Yu Yaoyao already felt towards Ling Shuang.</p>
<p>“Ugh,” groaned Yu Yaoayo, “Ew.”</p>
