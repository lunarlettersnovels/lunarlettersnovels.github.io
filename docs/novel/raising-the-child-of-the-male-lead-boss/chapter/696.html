            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 55 – An Elusive Beauty (1)</strong></p>
<p>The little steamed bun lost all traces of anticipation on his face. He bitterly gave him a look as his little head bowed low, looking at the porridge in the bowl in front of him, finding it suddenly unsavory to the eyes.</p>
<p>Ni Yi, trying to be inconspicuous to the side, wiped the sweat that dripped down his temple. When Yu Yaoyao finally came back downstairs, he rushed to take her away from the freezing scene.</p>
<p>He was afraid to stay one more second, as if sooner or later the young master will trigger another war between husband and wife.</p>
<p>However, when Shen Rui saw his mommy, he put aside his distress and immediately beamed at her with a contagious smile.</p>
<p>“Go mommy! Work hard and get the first place!” The steamed bun, holding the tail of his dinosaur onesie, smiled and waved at her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gave him a last loud kiss on the cheek and hurried out of the house with Ni Yi.</p>
<p>As soon as the gate was closed, the steamed bun suddenly looked at his dad with a disappointed face and declared with his butt facing him, “Dad, you will regret it.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside the nanny van, the anxious manager Ni Yi continuously wiped his never-ending sweat and gave Yu Yaoyao a last-minute cramming of all the important information she has to be aware of.</p>
<p>“The arrangement for the preliminaries is expected to be announced after you enter the group for filming. We can’t take this lightly. Just on the first day, they will eliminate the last 20 players and divide the rest into four classes according to popularity.”</p>
<p>He explained, “The top seven with the highest popularity will be rated A, while the rest are rated B, C and lastly, D. Consequently, the number of scenes will be reduced as rank decreases.”</p>
<p>As Ni Yi elaborated, his small eyes looked longingly at Yu Yaoyao who was casually drinking lemonade, “Sister, our goal this time is at the very least reach rank C, and then protect our spot as we fight for a rank B.”</p>
<p>He saw her startling acting prowess with his own eyes on the shooting of ‘<em>The Golden Age Empress’</em>, so this time he was a little confident.</p>
<p>But this stand-in mother was still burdened with fears. “This time the contestants are all fresh talents recommended directly by the company and directors. They all have several cards under their sleeves, which should not be underestimated! That’s why we still have to be careful!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao grunted in reply and picked up her cell phone to browse the net, “Meng Xinran has 5.62 million fans.”</p>
<p>She then looked towards Ni Yi, “Little Yi, how many fans do you think I can take away from her in this program?”</p>
<p>The corners of Ni Yi’s mouth pulled down to a grimace as he wiped another bead of sweat that had rolled down from his forehead. “Sister, she has good acting skills. Only, last time she made a blunder in the scene with you because she was not feeling well. Later, when you were done filming, I went to see her shoot her scenes and saw they were all okay.”</p>
<p>“Furthermore, this program is going to be filmed the whole process. So, you must not have any conflicts with her, else her fans will roast you brutally to death in the internet!”</p>
<p>This time Ni Yi’s voice took on a more cautious tone, “I also heard that elder brother Chen Jiao will also partake in the judging panel for several period. Sister, you <em>must, </em>at all cost, keep a distance from him!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stretched lazily, “I got it.”</p>
<p>Soon, the car stopped in front of a red bungalow. An eye-catching sign with the words <em>‘Rebirth in the Limelight’</em> was hung at the very top, in visible view to everyone. Ni Yi stepped out of the car and helped Yu Yaoyao out, opening the car door.</p>
<p>Currently, there are many photographers stationed around the door, ready to take the first picture of the young new talents to join the group for this competition.</p>
<p>As soon as Yu Yaoyao’s car stopped, the photographers, like big crocodiles which had catch the whiff of the scent of meat, excitedly pointed their cameras towards the unopened door.</p>
<p>As soon as the door was slowly pulled open, a slender, snowy leg wearing a cute, brown, wooly boot, stepped on the ground. The snow boots were thick and heavy, ordinary people might even have a hard time moving their feet with it. But her slim legs were still straight and firm.</p>
<p>The photographers couldn’t help but hold their breath as they waited for her to get out of the car.</p>
<p>In her past life, Yu Yaoyao has never let any of her visiting tourists down. She was constantly being watched every day, therefore she knows people well.</p>
