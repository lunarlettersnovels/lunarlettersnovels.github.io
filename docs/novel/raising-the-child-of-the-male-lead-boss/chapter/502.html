<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>The phone ended. Xinjie was seething and had hung up, unable to hear anymore.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the comment section under the live broadcast had blown up with the new change:</p>
<p><strong>【 I think my monthly salary was only 5k at 24? And I spent most of them on my clothes and makeup. Now five years have passed, and I can only afford a toilet in this city! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 I have no house and no car, I’m not qualified to say anything about you, Mr. Shen! Kneel to the boss, I’m sorry! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 I think Sis Y is right. Mr. Shen had worked hard for 10 years, what’s the matter even if he retires early? All the netizens on the internet, how much have you earned to say this to him?</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 Shocked, her sister is …… living off her brother-in-law? 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 It sounds really sad, Sis Y must be completely disappointed with her sister. She treated her sister too nicely, and she’s spoiled! 】</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao calmly faced the camera and handed the phone back to the staff. She turned to the seafood court with a smile on her face. “Baby, come and see. There are so many fishes,” she said to Shen Rui. <em>Yu Xinjie, hopefully you will think better than to gloat next time, </em>thought Yu Yaoyao. <em>You asked for it.</em></p>
<p>The staff showed her the phone with the news of acquisition of Digital Empire. The couple had made a move at the same time. One had maintained the image of her husband with one call, while the other had dispelled all rumors with one stroke.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hugged Little Bun and grinned at the camera. “Is daddy rich again?” asked Shen Rui. Yu Yaoyao nodded. “Let’s go find daddy?” she said. They both were so happy that food didn’t matter anymore. Shen Rui was happy that he could go to vacations with his mum and dad and not have to worry about money anymore.</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s go find daddy!” he jumped with joy. He missed his dad. Dad used to carry him on his shoulders all the time.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded happily. The staff were confused with this turn of events. While Director Zhao, looking at the monitor, was dumbfounded. So, she was just playing them along until now? Surprisingly, Shen Yichong was smiling at the monitor too. He was touched by how Yu Yaoyao had defended him.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>However, Yu Xinjie in her villa was in such a rage that she was smashing anything that came in her way. Chen Jiao, in an underground garage, wearing a mask and a hat, frowned.</p>
<p>“Why did you make that idiot do such a thing?” asked a girl in a red skirt.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao frowned, leaning over to pick the candy jar that she had thrown. “Little Shuang, you used to say candies cured everything,” he said, placing the jar on the table. She had saved him from desperation years ago. But time could change many things.</p>
<p>“I am not a child anymore,” she said. Ling Shuang grabbed the candy in his hand and threw it away. Chen Jiao looked shocked.</p>
<p>“Promise me you won’t bother them again?” she insisted, holding his hand, “You left Guangxin, you are free now!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao sighed. This was the only way that he could redeem his image. If Shen Yichong’s image remained positive, those who criticized Chen Jiao would never shut up. They would always stain him and his reputation in favor of Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Little Shuang, leave this to me,” he said, “Anyway, I will keep my promise to you. Very soon, I’ll get you a chance to get close to Shen Yichong and help you realize your dream.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s face lit up. “You are the best!” she said, “We have only had each other since our parents died. I won’t let you down.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao smiled. But he froze as he saw the hot searches that popped up now:</p>
<p><strong>[Guangxin acquires the special effects company, a beautiful turnaround!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Guangxin expects to officially enter the movie market!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[YYY battles her stepsister!]</strong></p>
<p>Things never went as he planned. It had gone haywire yet again!</p>
