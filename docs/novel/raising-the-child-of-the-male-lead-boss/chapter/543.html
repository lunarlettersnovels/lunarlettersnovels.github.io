            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 218 – Cash Cow (2)</strong></p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao and the little bun glimpsed at each other and gave a quick once over.</p>
<p>The little bun stretched out his chibi hand and tried hard to reach his dad’s arm so he could pat it reassuringly. “Don’t try to hide it, Dad. Mommy told me that she’ll give you pocket money. In the future, don’t burden yourself with anything other than staying at home to cook dinner.”</p>
<p>Though he was young, Shen Rui had a keen enough mind to notice that the numerous grandmas and aunts who used to do housework no longer dropped by as of late. It only went to strengthen his mother’s words from earlier. <em>Maybe it was really true that Daddy no longer had the money to spare to pay them any more!</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed as well. “Husband, don’t try to hide it from the cub and I any longer. It won’t take much time to make money anyway.” As she said that, she paused. “At the moment, let’s try to save money on food bills. By the way, eat your food quickly. If it grows cold and you reheat it, you’ll waste more money on gas bills.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “….”</p>
<p>“Borrowing loans, the steep decline in stock prices, none of it is fake news, right? Now the cash cow’s going to fly away?” Yu Yaoyao asked seriously.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t find it in himself to refute her.</p>
<p><em>It’s almost impossible to explain the truth to them. My words have been completely misunderstood. Moreover, it’s really funny and heart-warming to see the mother and son duo hen pecking to save money and work hard to support the family ….</em></p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu kept winking and giving a thumbs-up, signaling Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p><em>Interactive!</em></p>
<p><em>Show-casing sweet family feelings!</em></p>
<p>Although the segment with Yu Yaoyao driving her sister out of their home would sell like hot cakes, the program’s original intention was for it to be a warm show, not a bunch of paparazzis digging up explosive scoops. Therefore, per Director Zhao’s point of view, the value of that segment wasn’t that great. It didn’t have as much selling ability as this young couple sprinkling dog food in front of the camera.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t understand what his signals meant at all. But soon, Director Zhao Yu pulled over Old Zheng and made a gesture of feeding him.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes lit up when she saw it! Feeding each other was a sweet action specific to lovers. She had seen it on many TV episodes, and she had even been fed by Shen Yichong twice before. However, she had never done anything similar for him, except when she let him test her dishes in the kitchen just now.</p>
<p><em>Hehe … feeling so shy~</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blushed, yet still picked up the fork in front of her, took a bite of the steak, and delivered the rest to Shen Yichong’s mouth. “Husband, let me feed you~”</p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu immediately smiled as bright as a blooming flower. Her demure face, watery eyes laced with a touch of an innocent girl’s love, the trace of attachment that seemed to drip from her soul towards Shen Yichong- This complex and pure emotion made him, the melon stand peddler, very happy.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s actions made the ever poker faced Shen Yichong blush. It was a natural gesture to test dishes in the kitchen just then, but now, her method of deliberately taking the romantic route, especially when he glanced at the camera next to him, and then his son’s envious eyes, dripping with jealousy, directed at him- his ears turned scorching hot. Nevertheless, when he looked at the girl’s shy little mien, he couldn’t help but be reminded of her series of heroic and frugal actions today … he simply couldn’t bear to refuse her.</p>
<p>Finally, he opened his mouth and bit the beef on her fork.</p>
<p>As soon as he bit it down, he felt the splash of tender beef juice in his mouth, and there was some slight sweetness hidden in the savory deliciousness. He seemed to finally understand the exaggerated expressions she made every time she ate.</p>
<p><em>It really was delicious.</em></p>
<p>At that moment, when he gently swallowed the steak down his throat, he even missed the faint sweetness on the tip of his tongue. It seemed to be better than any Michelin star dinners he had had before. Every drop of the juice seemed to flow straight into his heart.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao watched him take a bite of meat, chewing slowly on one side of his cheek … Abashed, she lowered her head. After a while, she remembered her dream. There was a line that she had always wanted to try using after she read it in a book. It was just that she hadn’t had any chance to try that before.</p>
<p>“Husband, is it delicious?” Her eyes flickered in anticipation.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded, his mouth crooked. “Well, do you know why it is so delicious?”</p>
<p>She blinked vigorously again. “Because it … contains my deep love and admiration for you … Husband, what you’re eating has been dipped in my utmost affections, ladled from the bottom of my heart.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>The melodrama left a bitter taste, blinding one’s corneas. But the corners of his mouth still curled up quickly, his heart dunked in the sweetest honey there was.</p>
