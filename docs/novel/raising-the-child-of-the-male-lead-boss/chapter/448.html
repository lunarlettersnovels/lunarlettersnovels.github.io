<p><strong>Chapter 315 – Inborn Talent (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>When he returned home later, feeling exhausted after his shooting schedule, still constantly having to be reminded of what to do and when the deadline was… He was irritated with the constant nagging.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, he felt disgusted and suddenly, he felt heavy and tired.</p>
<p>Wei Ming raised his eyebrows and immediately looked back at Yu Yaoyao. Her performance earlier was completely different from her perfect image as a goddess. She had now become a full-time wife who had been working around firewood, rice, oil, and salt.</p>
<p>This was their second job together.</p>
<p>The last time he had played the role of the emperor in ‘The Queen of the Flourishing Age,’ her performance in the scene had also almost made him lose himself.</p>
<p>“Xiao Yu, your acting skills have improved recently,” he said in admiration.</p>
<p>For an actress her age, who could render such power over the characters and have the ability to drive the emotions of the accompanying actor, she was a rarity. Wei Ming could count how many had her talent on just one hand!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao waved her hand casually. Normally, she would smile and joke with him, but because they had an antagonistic relationship in their current roles, she always kept her distance from him. As a result, they were not very close.</p>
<p>“You flatter me,” she said politely. “I’m nowhere near as good as you.”</p>
<p>“How can you say that? You got me so immersed.”</p>
<p>“Brother Wei, you abandoned your wife and your child to have an affair. I couldn’t even see a hint of that on your face while you were eating during the take!” Yu Yaoyao raised a thumb as she spoke. “You have great acting skills!”</p>
<p>Wei Ming was speechless.</p>
<p>The crew next to him laughed sullenly.</p>
<p>Even Director Qi laughed out loud, “Okay, Wei Ming. Stop messing around with Xiao Yu. Let her go get changed.”</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao went to the dressing room, Director Qi patted Wei Ming’s shoulder comfortingly, “Did you notice something?”</p>
<p>Wei Ming smiled bitterly. When she mocked him for being an innocent looking cheater, he had suddenly felt emotional. He nodded, “She got immersed in her role. As soon as the filming started, she became her character. At that moment, she seemed to empathize with the character as she felt my lines and emotions. She reacted accordingly. At that moment, she became the wife. It seemed almost impossible to drag her out of it.”</p>
<p>Director Qi nodded, “Yes, she believes that she is Fang Xuewei, and she believes very much in her own words and deeds. This sense of belief not only makes her performance and character feel alive, but she also affects you. Instead of saying she’s acting, we could probably say she was reflecting what she experienced.”</p>
<p>Wei Ming’s expression changed to one of sentimentality, “Unexpectedly, I, who have been filming continuously for years, have lost to her, who has finally returned to the screen after five years. It seems that I should take a break after filming this piece. I should give myself some time to think, so I can return to my original state of performance,” he glanced at the monitor again.</p>
<p>He suddenly felt that the Yaoyao on the screen looked like she was separated from the on-set staff and equipment by an invisible wall. At that moment, she seemed to have entered her own spiritual world. She was in her best state, free from any outside influence. At that time, at this place, under this plot, she was Fang Xuewei. Under her influence, his habit from the previous drama had been broken.</p>
<p>Her ‘Fang Xuewei’ also caused a chemical reaction in his body. He remembered that he was the ‘cheating husband of Fang Xuewei.’</p>
<p>Wei Ming’s expression changed, he could only feel admiration for her in the end, “After experiencing so much pressure from public opinion recently, she can still achieve this. That level of concentration is far above me. I’m… ashamed.”</p>
<p>Qi Hang, who was still holding the thermos, handed him a cigarette, “Come, let’s go smoke. Some people are born talented, and some have to rely on hard work. Don’t feel discouraged. Just catch up with hard work!”</p>
<p>Wei Ming gave a sour smile, “Director, why do you have to be so honest? Do you know it hurts?” he was almost 12 years older than Yu Yaoyao, he really did have to work hard to catch up.</p>
<p>Before knocking off, he posted an emotional live report on Weibo:</p>
<p>[<em>There is no end to honing my acting skills. I have to work harder and learn more. I am grateful to a dedicated actor from the cast for her assistance.]</em></p>
<p>Because of his sudden post, many of Wei Ming’s loyal fans also popped up and posted:</p>
<p><em>[Our Old Wei is finally deciding to work harder?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Learn more about how to post on Weibo. Come online more. Thank you!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Old Wei’s acting skill is good though… Who dealt him such a blow?]</em></p>
<p>They didn’t have to wait long until they got their reply. Qi Hang posted:</p>
<p><em>[Hang in there! There are still 35 minor scenes to go. You can do this!]</em></p>
<p>After they saw Qi Hang’s reply, many fans saw reason.</p>
<p>When Wei Ming was confirmed to shoot ethical films, his makeup photos were exposed online. Many people also knew that he would be cast with Yu Yaoyao this time.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Wei Ming was a hot search again.</p>
<p>YY fans started going online every few minutes to keep the topic of #bloodsuckingmotherhaveyouapologized on top of the search. If they had nothing better to do, they would scroll to see all the latest updates. It didn’t take long until they saw Wei Ming’s Weibo.</p>
<p>Immediately they knew it was their sister YY and her on-screen husband.</p>
