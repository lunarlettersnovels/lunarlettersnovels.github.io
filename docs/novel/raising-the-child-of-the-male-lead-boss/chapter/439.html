            <p><strong>Chapter 324 – Defeat</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>The little bun Shen Rui’s words made his father go cold. His son still wanted his mother, not his old father… The five-year-old child wanted to steal his mother’s bed from his own father.</p>
<p>Before Shen Yichong could say no, Yu Yaoyao had already agreed with her son, “Okay, Rui Rui is sleeping next to Mommy. Mommy will cuddle you tonight.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong remained silent. He coolly sent Ni Yi away. When he returned, he saw Shen Rui’s earlier sadness was gone. He had already kicked off his shoes, had hopped onto their bed and was vigorously jumping up and down.</p>
<p>“Dad, you can sleep in my cot next door tonight. Rui Rui will help you bring your pillow!” the child said.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a deep breath and looked at his smiling wife on the sofa.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was already overwhelmed with joy. She looked at the Little Bun jumping on the bed, and conscientiously mediated for her husband, “Rui, darling, can’t your father sleep with us? You are pushing him to sleep in the next room. Isn’t it a bit pitiful?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face instantly relaxed. Seeing his son about to jump off the edge of the bed, he stretched out his hand to catch him.</p>
<p>Little Shen Rui jumped into him, leaned away, and hopped directly to the center of the bed, without landing in Shen Yichong’s arms at all, “Dad!” he said in exasperation. Finally, he jumped and fell on the bed. Slowly, he pushed up to sit on his round butt and turned his pale, tender face towards his mother. “Dad is an old man, he’s not afraid of the dark. It won’t be pitiful, Mommy.”</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>Little Bun didn’t notice his father’s dark mood, and slowly rolled himself into the quilt of the big bed like a caterpillar and snuggled down. “I went to sleep by myself when I was three years old. Dad is in his thirties,” as he spoke, he stretched out his two small palms, tried a few times to wedge himself out with his chubby fingers, but he gave up. “He is not pitiful,” as if he had finally convinced himself of this fact, he grinned.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao couldn’t hold in her laughter anymore. She held her stomach and sat laughing on the sofa.</p>
<p>Little Bun saw his mommy laughing and looked at his father triumphantly. Suddenly, his body was lifted up, still wrapped in the quilt. The smile on his face froze. He looked up into his dad’s gloomy face. Before he could call Mommy for help, Shen Yichong carried him to the bathroom.</p>
<p>The bathroom door closed with a slam.</p>
<p>The wrapped-up Little Bun began to struggle. He only managed to free one small hand that he wildly gestured around with. He wasn’t strong enough to free himself or fight back and had no way to escape.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong grabbed him under his arm.</p>
<p>“Dad!” Little Bun was so anxious, and his voice was so high, he was sure it could be heard in Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows, his temples were throbbing with the pain of a massive headache. His low voice hissed between the gaps of his clenched teeth, “Use your mind. You think I didn’t know that you were scolding me in your little head?”</p>
<p>Little Bun said with a pout, “Dad, I wasn’t.”</p>
<p>“Shen Rui, do you want me to discipline you*, huh? What I promised you just now, I can cancel immediately,” Shen Yichong was angry but still amused by his son.</p>
<p><em>*Shen Yichong means physical discipline here by spanking.</em></p>
<p>Little Bun immediately fell silent and stopped struggling.</p>
<p>“I am an adult. Who did you just call old? I am your father! I just agreed to your whims, and this is how you treat me?”</p>
<p>Little Bun pouted again and grunted in anguish, “I didn’t, I didn’t say anything wrong… and I haven’t slept with Mommy for a long time… Little Hua and Little Ming from class both sleep with their mothers, I asked them. And I cried today… I want Mommy to hug me and pat me to sleep…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s forehead was throbbing, “Then you drove me away?”</p>
<p>Little Bun suddenly raised his face, a little confused, “Dad, the bed is too small. You will squish me!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong gritted his teeth, “You have to pay the price if you want a little brother.”</p>
<p>Little Bun was not easy to fool, “It’s been a long time. Where’s my brother? Mommy said that even the little yellow dog in the house next door has a little brother.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face darkened, and his chest pulled tight.</p>
<p>Little Bun knew that his father was still a good father, and that he was facing many difficulties. Finally, after thinking about it, he stretched out a little hand and patted Shen Yichong’s shoulder to comfort him, “Dad, forget it. Don’t worry, take your time,” he said. “I just felt sad today, and I wanted to sleep with Mommy for one night. I will return Mommy to you tomorrow, and you will continue to make a little brother,” Shen Rui also had a deep sense of righteousness and was very modest. “Anyway, I am used to sleeping alone.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t know why, but his heart ached, and he couldn’t laugh or cry.</p>
<p>“Dad, if you are afraid of being alone, move the cot in from next door, and I will sleep between you and Mommy.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t fight him. In the end, the head of the family was defeated by his son.</p>
