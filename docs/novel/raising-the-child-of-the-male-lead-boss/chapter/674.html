            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 77 – Phone Call</strong></p>
<p>When Meng Xinran heard the rules set by the assistant director, she was also thrown into shock, immediately losing the color from her face.</p>
<p>“Director, isn’t there a mistake? We–”</p>
<p>This was not part of her initial plan! Now, the whole room is full of hostility towards her, while Yu Yaoyao has won their hearts!</p>
<p>But the assistant director merely waved his hand, cutting her off, “68, hurry up! This was brought out from the majority vote! If you further delay, you will only shorten your time to perform!”</p>
<p>Although he said this, it further stabilized the hate directed at Meng Xinran. However, before the assistant director left, his eyes turned to Yu Yaoyao who was huddled in a corner, with some surprise in his irises.</p>
<p>Just recently, he had received a temporary order from the chief director. He had wanted Yu Yaoyao to perform last. In this way, she can be given plenty of time to perform and stay in the show as possible.</p>
<p>“Numerous controversies. Wealthy background. Talk of the town. Outstanding appearance. Good-natured personality. Perfect! Make her the highlight.” Word after word, the chief director only spoke highly.</p>
<p>For a program to gain the attention of the audience, it must have one or two hot topics to attract them like moths to the fire. Plus, she has support from sponsors. Therefore, the chief director obviously thought to give her more exposure.</p>
<p>Which means, there will be many cuts of her in the final film. And the assistant director knew very well which ones were worth showing from the scene.</p>
<p>Before leaving, he smiled reassuringly at Ni Yi, who was sweating profusely. The anxious Ni Yi was only shocked by his unexpected mirth.</p>
<p><em>What could the assistant director mean? </em>He rubbed his arms, always feeling strange.</p>
<p>Ni Yi looked at Yu Yaoyao in the middle of the match and was worried. Like the rest of the eager audience, he then went to the front to see the performance of the contestants. But he really wanted to see these amateur actors make mistakes to increase his confidence…</p>
<p>However, he didn’t expect that one after another, they actually performed passably. From beginning to end, there was nothing he could pick out from the acting scenes. Even the judges praised the performance, with a lack of heavy criticism.</p>
<p>The more Ni Yi looked, the more drums he felt in his system–20 players will be eliminated again for today!</p>
<p>Will his elder sister be lucky today?</p>
<p><em>Sister, if you make a mistake, you’re doomed. </em>Ni Yi paced back and forth under the stage, but his time filled with anxiety passed by quickly. As Ni Yi was still discerning their chances of winning, he suddenly found Meng Xinran on stage.</p>
<p>“Hello everyone, my performance topic for today is to make a phone call. And my prop is a mobile phone.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi sighed.<em> Isn’t this Meng Xinran’s luck too much?</em></p>
<p>For actors, the more routinely the action is, the easier it is to perform. Simply because it was something you experience at ordinary times. To perform it successfully, one only need to act natural as much as possible. While these deliberations were in his head, he soon heard Meng Xinran’s clear lines spoken fluently.</p>
<p>“Elder brother, I really, <em>really</em>, got the part for the lead actress!? You must be joking with me…”</p>
<p>The ecstatic mood was directly reflected in her voice. Even if one were not to look at the scene, they could already feel her intense joy and the content of her performance: she finally got a call from an audition.</p>
<p>Ni Yi frowned and looked at the stage. There was not a flaw in her expression, which means, this was something she had obviously already experienced for her to act it so naturally.</p>
<p>This topic was simply a piece of cake for her!</p>
<p>At the moment, the whole lovely girl’s face was filled with incredulity mixed with joy, and her mouth was open agape with her eyes almost bulging from their sockets. She even shook her fist excitedly and jumped twice in place. This really was nothing difficult for Meng Xinran, who has performed several plays.</p>
<p><em>It’s too easy!</em></p>
<p>“What, you have bad news for me?” Meng Xinran’s joyful voice suddenly changed.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was immediately stunned. Because in the next second, the excited tone in her voice was replaced with a somber one.</p>
<p>Her low voice sounded, “Grandma, grandma…what’s wrong with grandma? Elder brother tell me–what happened to grandma?!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi wanted to cough blood!</p>
<p>In this phone call, not only did she expressed immense joy, but she also inserted shocking sadness! It was turning out to be a rich, emotional interpretation of the combination of sorrow and happiness!</p>
<p>Finally ending her part, Meng Xinran bowed, the warm applause reaching her ears—forever embedded in her mind.</p>
<p>“Long live Ranran!”</p>
<p>“Fighting, Ranran!”</p>
<p>“Little cutey, fight!”</p>
<p>A lot of her fans were on the scene, excitedly shaking their signboards.</p>
