            <p><strong>Chapter 352</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>She scrolled to the comment section; all the people were praising the director for his vision, strategy, and good actress selection. They were even praising Gu Qianqian for her good looks and acting skills… She even found a comment from Yu Yaoyao cheering Gu Qianqian on!</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s teeth were barely holding under the pressure of her gritted jaw.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao. It was her doing! Just as she had expected!</p>
<p>When she arrived home, she was just about to contact Yu Xinjie again when her manager arrived. “Xiao Shuang, give me your phone for a second,” her manager said.</p>
<p>“Sister Li?” Ling Shuang glanced at her viciously.</p>
<p>“Don’t be nervous,” Guo Li smiled kindly, “Brother Jiao said that Xiao Huang was negligent at work. I found a new assistant for you, I just want to put their phone number into your phone. At the same time…”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang breathed a sigh of relief and handed Guo Li her phone. Her phone was considered fairly ‘clean’. Sensitive chat records were often transferred to her computer before she deleted the history on her phone.</p>
<p>Guo Li took the phone and started tapping on the screen, “Brother Jiao is busy. The director asked him not to be on his phone these days. Just contact me if you need anything. I already found a few roles for you. I will mail you the contracts this afternoon for you to sign.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang smiled when she heard this. Chen Jiao was still standing by her side no matter what. She didn’t have any doubt when she got her phone back. She even dismissed Guo Li politely.</p>
<p>But as she closed the door, she suddenly realized something was wrong with her phone:</p>
<p>Weibo account: Logged out.</p>
<p>Facebook: Logged out.</p>
<p>All the passwords had been changed!</p>
<p><em>Sorry, Xiao Shuang. It’s better if you stop interacting with the public during this time period, </em>Guo Li’s text message said.</p>
<p>In the next second, multiple contracts were sent to her. Ling Shuang could just about have spurted blood when she saw them.</p>
<p>The role of an eighty-year-old man, an ugly fat man who was critically ill, a mistress stabbed to death, a female thief who got beaten up for stealing and then got dumped in a pig pen!</p>
<p>What were these!</p>
<p>She was so angry that she called Chen Jiao right away. He didn’t answer.</p>
<p>She confronted Guo Li about it over a phone call, but she only got a cold reply, “According to the contract, you need to pick up notices that are worth more than one million RMB in total each year. So, these are the ones I have arranged for you, since you can’t get the others yourself. Now, you work hard and finish all these<em>,</em>” Guo Li said.</p>
<p>“Guo Li, you’re crazy! I am telling Brother Jiao about this! Do you know what relationship I have with Brother Jiao! Does my brother know that you’re doing this! What kind of garbage characters are these!” Ling Shaung shouted.</p>
<p>“Brother Jiao’s crew is away to focus on shooting. They will only be free after a month or two. If you don’t go for these, the articles about you will be nastier tomorrow,” Guo Li answered calmly.</p>
<p>“Are you… A bastard! Tell me my Weibo password now!” Ling Shuang screamed angrily.</p>
<p>But she received no answer.</p>
<p>Guo Li got into the car and handed her phone to the man in the front seat wearing a black hat. “Brother Jiao, it’s all done. There will be two people watching her closely.”</p>
<p>The man took off his sunglasses and revealed his pair of ice-cold peachy eyes, “Drag her there if she resists. Go greet the group performers and the director beforehand.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll say we need to hone her temper. I’ll let them give her the worst role.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s screams, and curses kept rising from the phone. Chen Jiao’s thin, sexy lips rose into a smile, and he said, “Good.”</p>
<p>He must be patient.</p>
<p>This was just the beginning.</p>
<p>She had fooled him and done ridiculous things for so many years, and it was now finally his turn. How could he allow the whole thing to be over within just a day or two? He was going to take back all he had given to her! He was going to torture her the way she had tortured Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Back at the hotel, Yu Yaoyao, who was still fast asleep, was suddenly awakened by the vibration of her phone.</p>
<p>She shook off the sleepiness she had from just waking up from her nap after lunch, and checked her phone.</p>
<p><em>Are you free to meet up?</em></p>
<p>~<em>Brother Jiao</em></p>
<p>Goose bumps rose all over her body.</p>
<p>God, she still had Chen Jiao’s number in her phone. Even that name was disgusting.</p>
<p>Good lord!</p>
<p>She sat up hurriedly to delete the text message. But Little Bun peered over her arm suddenly. “Brother Jiao…? Mommy, who is Brother Jiao? He wants to meet you.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui had been particularly serious about recognizing words and letters recently. He said he wanted to be with his father to learn how to write, and improve together. He read everything he saw out loud.</p>
<p>His childish voice made Yu Yaoyao’s body turn cold. She turned her head to meet Shen Yichong’s faint gaze as he raised his head.</p>
<p>Sh*t!</p>
<p>Little Bun still hadn’t noticed anything unusual. He even pointed to the word on the phone, “Mommy, is this word ‘Jiao’?”</p>
<p>D*mn it!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao reached over and covered Little Bun’s mouth. But the moment she had done it she thought, ‘God d*mn it! Why did I have to act like I did something wrong?’</p>
<p>“Darling… Wait, it’s a misunderstanding. It’s a big misunderstanding!” she said quickly to her husband.</p>
<p>D*mn it! The address book left by the original owner had not been deleted! How was she supposed to fix this!</p>
