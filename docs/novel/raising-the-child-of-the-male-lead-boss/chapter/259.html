            <p><strong>Chapter 502</strong></p>
<p>For this reason, Director Liang and Director Li almost got into a fight. ‘Killer’ and ‘30 Days of Madness’ were both competitors. Both directors wanted to apply for Yu Yaoyao as the best actress, and also wanted to win the Best Feature Film Award… They could not convince each other. Of course, Li Bo also knew that the judges generally didn’t like hilarious films with a strong commercial atmosphere, but he also thought that this film was the perfect embodiment of Yu Yaoyao’s acting skills.</p>
<p>“Liang, Yaoyao is playing <em>two</em> roles in my film. Don’t fight with me for the best actress. I’ll give you the best feature film award. How about it? I won’t declare it.”</p>
<p>Li Bo felt that he was being reasonable. But when Director Liang heard it, his face almost turned red.</p>
<p>“Old Li, you are so kind!” he replied sarcastically.</p>
<p>How could he give it to him… Li Bo was not even a judge! If Li Bo didn’t declare it, did it mean he would definitely win the award!? Wasn’t this a trick to deceive children? Shameless!</p>
<p>“How about this, Old Li? I’ll give you the award for Best Picture. Xiao Yu’s role in ‘Killer’ has shown a transformation of her mindset, and she showcased a deep interpretation of the character, and the film has educational significance for society. I think this is what only the best actress can do.”</p>
<p>Director Liang was even more shameless. “Oh, if you don’t think just winning the Best Picture is enough, then I’ll give you the Best Educational Film Award too?”</p>
<p>Li Bo almost vomited blood when he heard it. What he had was a commercial film, why would he apply for an Educational Film Award!? This Xiao Liang was so shameless!</p>
<p>The two snorted at each other and hung up on the phone. They both turned to Yu Yaoyao. But Yu Yaoyao felt that both were not bad. Seeing that the two directors couldn’t agree with each other, she simply handed the decision to Shen Yichong, since the topic was supposed to be a headache for the agency.</p>
<p>“‘Crazy’ has not been released yet. Although it can be declared, but ‘Killer’ is definitely more secure.” Shen Yichong was extremely rational and made a decision directly.</p>
<p>“Do you think Director Li will cry?” Yu Yaoyao pursed her lips as she took a bite of a potato chip.</p>
<p>“…In the Q&amp;A session with reporters, you can help promote Director Li’s film,” he replied.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong thought about it and found a way to kill two birds with one stone. Shameless, but effective.</p>
<p>When Li Bo heard it, he agreed immediately. If he had a way to disgust Director Liang, he would already feel very good. But for Yu Yaoyao to win the award, ‘Killer’ was more secure. After thinking about it, he also became rational.</p>
<p>“Xiao Yu, the next time I make a patriotic film, I will invite you to be my heroine.”</p>
<p>The dispute between the two directors finally came to an end.</p>
<p>In August, when it was near the press conference of the Golden Rooster Awards, ‘30 Days of Madness’, directed by Li Bo, was also successfully released. The box office hit 150 million at the premiere. Douban comments were overwhelmed by comments such as <em>‘I laughed till my Coke spilled’, ‘xswl’, ‘comedy series’</em>…</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s first attempt at a humorous role was very successful. Even in several interactions between the male and female protagonists, the sweetness she created with Lu Cheng was quite layered.</p>
<p><strong>[Although the kiss scene is shot in a certain direction to make it real, Yaoyao’s gaze is so sweet!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Lu Cheng feels like he’s going to fall in love with Yaoyao, but I’m sorry, Yaoyao is mine!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yaoyao is domineering and mighty. Is she even more manly than Lu Cheng??]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Did Yaoyao learn this standing posture from Mr. Shen! It’s just… I’m dead! LOL!]</strong></p>
<p>Whether it was the fans’ perception or the follow-up analysis of the film critics, the comments were optimistic. Almost all gave four or five-star praises.</p>
<p><em>‘The script is filled with hilarious laughter due to the soul-exchange between the male and female protagonists. Although it’s old-fashioned, it still managed to be interesting.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Yu Yaoyao’s acting skills have risen to a new level, and she did not disappoint the fans.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Lu Cheng’s performance is also good. He portrays the softness of a woman, and the cuteness of a big man, without being too girly. ’</em></p>
<p><em>‘A person with two personalities was convincingly acted. ’</em></p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes footage was also posted on the Internet. Whether it was the military-like slogan and training in the morning, or Yaoyao’s terrifying whipping session… all of it made the audience go bald with laughter, and they almost couldn’t get up from their seats in the theatre. Some even got cramps while laughing at home!</p>
<p>Before the Golden Rooster Awards ceremony, fans already felt that their Yaoyao was the uncrowned king. She just did so well no matter what role she played.</p>
<p>On Weibo, everyone quickly saw a post by a long-lost artist.</p>
<p><strong>[Chen Jiao V: I’ve watched ‘30 Days of Madness’. Both the male and female protagonists have excellent acting skills, which also inspired me. Next, I should also go back to the starting point and start working hard again.]</strong></p>
<p>Soon, Chen Jiao’s studio announced that Chen Jiao would pursue a Master’s degree in performance. Fans of Chen Jiao were very excited as they finally saw their idol come back on Weibo. They all commented ‘Brother Jiao, we are waiting for you to come back’.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, YY fans were all sighing, saying comments like:<em> ‘Gangster Chen has finally grown up’, ‘Listen to Baby Bun’s words and study hard. That’s right’…</em></p>
<p>There were endless hot topics on the Internet, until finally, the day of the Golden Rooster Award ceremony arrived.</p>
