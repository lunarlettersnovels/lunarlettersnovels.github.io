            <p><strong>Chapter 372</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>But since he had the money, the producers couldn’t say anything against him. The investor had the highest authority.</p>
<p>“Well, if Mr. Shen insists, we will all cooperate,” the head producer relented.</p>
<p>The next day, Shen Yichong asked Chen Lin to make an additional investment proposal at the weekly investment meeting.</p>
<p>Since the last shuffle of the company shareholders, there were not many people left in Guangxin who would fight Shen Yichong. But Shen Yichong also didn’t want to be the only person making decisions in the company.</p>
<p>Regarding the additional investment, he had clearly laid out the facts, and his reasoning was too powerful to be refuted.</p>
<p>Firstly, his wife’s online influence was not any weaker when compared to the popular Korean artists. According to the survey data of the movie “Chaos”, which had only been broadcasted for a week, 2% of the people went to watch it for Yu Yaoyao, or because they had seen her wonderful performance in the trailer.</p>
<p>Second, the youth themes were now scarce in the market. The female audience preferred to watch dramas with themes like love, fighting in the palace, or with daughter-in-law mother-in-law drama.</p>
<p>“Youth Without Regrets” also had better intentions than the original script, after some changes had been made. With the unique perspective of a story about an independent conquering the successful CEO, the survey data of several major consulting companies showed that the target group would be teenage girls aged between 10-15 years old. The ratings were expected to surpass the previous drama with the themes of fighting in the palace.</p>
<p>After Shen Yichong finished presenting his PowerPoint, he ended with a powerful summary “In conclusion, I have decided to make additional investments. Voice your opinion now or hold your peace.” He looked seriously at the management group in the conference room.</p>
<p>With how confident he was feeling, he may as well have worn a T-shirt saying “My wife is the best in the entertainment industry. Who else is there to invest in but her?”</p>
<p>Most of the management members looked at each other and remained silent. This was mainly due to Yu Yaoyao’s proven ability and influence. Instead of investing in a project that the people weren’t familiar with, it was better to invest the money in their lady boss who they knew was good at what she did. The most important thing was that both the male and female starring actors in this drama were Guangxin artists.</p>
<p>If this drama got popular, it would be a great benefit to the company.</p>
<p>Whether it was Qiu Dacheng or Yu Yaoyao, it would be a profitable business; provided the drama brought in more popularity.</p>
<p>No matter how much they had to invest, it was feasible.</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. No one had any other thoughts.</p>
<p>But Xu Hong gritted his teeth. “Mr. Shen, we have already invested heavily in another youth drama. This additional investment could lead to strong competition among two of our own investments. If we vigorously promote ‘Youth Without Regrets’, it is likely to affect the other one. I think we should consider putting it aside first…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong cocked an eyebrow and looked at him sharply. “Reason? Please provide data to substitute your claims that the other one is likely to be more successful. What have you to present to the others to convince them of your words?”</p>
<p>“I… I just think we could achieve better results easier if we focus our power on one. We previously all studied the script together, and the data from that was reported on at the last meeting.” Xu Hong’s face flushed.</p>
<p>“Previously?” Shen Yichong squinted at him. “The investment was something from at least half a year ago. Has the current market data been updated since then? Have the audience’s preferences changed? Since the two protagonists have been determined, have you done a follow-up profit analysis?”</p>
<p>Xu Hong opened and closed his mouth awkwardly. He obviously had not done this.</p>
<p>“Investment Department, have you raised a group of people who make decisions based on their preference?” Shen Yichong looked at the head of Human Resources in dissatisfaction. “Unable to provide data, relying on intuition, relying on personal preference… I don’t need such a person. This is the last time I will say this.”</p>
<p>Xu Hong pinched his notebook nervously.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at him. “In addition… Business department, share with us the different resources brought in by these two youth films. What is the current return on our investment?”</p>
<p>The director of the business department wiped the sweat from his forehead and said in a clear voice, “Boss, the first youth film that we invested in, ‘Girlhood’, is currently scheduled to be broadcasted over the summer vacation. According to the producer’s feedback, a total income of one million Yuan can be expected from advertisement insertion. It is estimated that we can earn at least one million. The broadcast period of ‘Youth Without Regrets’ has not been announced yet. However, it is estimated that the advertisement income will be more than 10 million. After Sister Yu’s movie was broadcasted, a new advertiser came in. They said if they can’t have her as their spokesperson, they at least want to be able to promote their products via her work. I estimated that our revenue would exceed 15 million in the end.”</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, Shen Yichong turned his indifferent gaze on Xu Hong. “You were aware of this data, am I right?”</p>
<p>Xu Hong was sweating bullets now.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong picked up the documents lying on the table. They were investment plans to be discussed at the current meeting. “Are you serious about the investment plans that you’ve prepared for today?”</p>
<p>Xu Hong nodded, his face pale. He jumped when then documents were slammed down in front of him.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to fool me by showing me these worthless projects that would bring no return to my investment?” Shen Yichong said in a cold voice.</p>
