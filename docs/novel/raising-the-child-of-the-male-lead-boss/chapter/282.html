            <p><strong>Chapter 481</strong></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was really surprised after she read the comments; she couldn’t come back to her senses for a long time. After every update, she would usually sneak a peek at the comment section to see what her readers said. She would listen to suggestions and see if she had caused any public outrage. After all, she always ran out of things to write when the climax was near, and in the end, gave false hope. She even took a long break. In the end, she feared that she would be scolded to death.</p>
<p>Therefore, she was almost pretty familiar with the readers that often left her messages. She would even know who wasn’t present in the comment section.</p>
<p>She was even more familiar with the YYY’s ID. To think it was Yu Yaoyao’s initials all along… This reader left messages almost every day, but she went silent for a while and disappeared for several months. At that time, she thought that YYY might have given up on her book. Little did she expect that she came back last month. Since then, she would comment on every chapter and give sharp comments. She would even guess about the story in the later chapters.</p>
<p><em>‘The reader turned out to be Yu Yaoyao…?’ </em>Fang Qiuye’s eyes widened. She never thought about that absurd possibility. Never in a million dreams! Yaoyao commenting on each of her chapters?! Omg! Was she dreaming?</p>
<p>“Hiss…” Fang Qiuye pinched her arms, and it hurt! She finally looked at Yu Yaoyao, her eyes overflowing with joyous light, “Yaoyao, did you stop reading for a while?”</p>
<p>As expected, Yu Yaoyao was resting for at least half a year.</p>
<p>“Yup,” Yu Yaoyao replied. As she spoke this, she looked bitter. “A few months before I gave birth to Little Sweetheart, my husband wouldn’t let me see it. It’s bad for my eyesight and prenatal education. Plus the radiation from the screen.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye suddenly blushed. Yu Yaoyao felt that she was extremely miserable. “I finally reinstalled the app after giving birth to my baby. I almost forgot the password too! Shen Yichong is such a jerk.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye touched her nose shyly. So it turned out to be true. Yaoyao was her reader, and she was even a loyal one!</p>
<p>With trembling hands, Fang Qiuye finally shared her WeChat QR code to Yu Yaoyao. Yu Yaoyao immediately scanned it. After sweeping, the first thing Yu Yaoyao did was to see the past stories Fang Qiuye posted!</p>
<p>While doing this, Yu Yaoyao was surprised, “Huh? Big Head, are you also a reader of Dacheng? Wow… You even help her promote by sharing the cover and links to her works. Compared to you, I am not the best fan!”</p>
<p>No matter how brazen Fang Qiuye was, she couldn’t help but feel shy after hearing this. Instead of helping the author promote her books, it was self-promotion! She was such a shameless person!</p>
<p>“Wow, you really are a professional when it comes to being a fan!” Yaoyao enthused, giving a thumbs up. “I also want to learn from you and promote for Dacheng~”</p>
<p>After saying that, she started introducing Shen Dacheng’s works to the audience through the live broadcast camera. She even read the beginning of the free chapter to the audience.</p>
<p>“Wait, since it’s an English tutoring episode… Big Head, we have to be more serious. You teach me how to say these sentences in English, okay?” she began, notw aiting for Fang Qiuye’s reply.</p>
<p>“Chapter 1. She slipped into his embrace and his arms wound tightly around her… Big Head, how do you translate this sentence?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye: “…”</p>
<p>YY fans who watched the live broadcast quickly downloaded the app after listening to Yaoyao. Those who were already fans of the novel even started searching for the author’s name online. Even though they came prepared, they still found it funny when Yu Yaoyao said she wanted to read the novel in English!</p>
<p><em>[If my teacher back then let me learn English in this way, I would have become a fluent English speaker!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Did you guys see the change in expression on our President’s face? Hahahahahah!!]</em></p>
<p><em>[A good way to learn English and memorize words! Tsk, ‘…his arms wound tightly around her,’ I’ll remember it well after reading it just once!]</em></p>
<p><em>[You should summon Mr. Shen for this!]</em></p>
<p>Halfway through watching the live broadcast, Gong Xuechang’s eyelids jumped. Originally, his blind date’s hard-working, diligent and studious character when she begged him to teach her English made him even ignore her sloppy appearance. However, he didn’t expect she was doing this to meet her idol. At first, he was a little angry. But when he watched the live broadcast and found that his blind date and Yu Yaoyao were both working hard in teaching and studying, he felt a little better after realizing they didn’t do it just for the show.</p>
<p>But little did he expect their topic changed so quickly. When his eyes were still on the broadcast, he soon realized that his phone was ringing. He was shocked when he saw the caller ID.</p>
