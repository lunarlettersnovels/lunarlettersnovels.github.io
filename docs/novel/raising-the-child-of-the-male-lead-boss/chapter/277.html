<p><strong>Chapter 485.2</strong></p>
<p>“Your father is reluctant to let you drink refrigerated milk. He really spoils you,” she began with a sigh. “Your brother Shen Rui is the same. He wants me to carry you more than a dozen times a day, saying that it’s to grow our relationship, and otherwise you’ll be unhappy and won’t grow tall enough in the future…”</p>
<p>One was a slave to her daughter while one was a slave to his sister. Perfect! In fact, she, herself, had always been soft-hearted.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll propose to the father and son today to slowly resume work.” Yu Yaoyao nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>After dinner in the evening, Yu Yaoyao used the posture Shen Dacheng mentioned in the novel and wrapped Shen Yichong’s waist with her legs.</p>
<p>“Darling… I want to start acting again~” she said. “When Little Sweetheart grows up, I don’t want her to think that her Mommy hasn’t done any work in the past. Darling, I also want to go out to make money~”</p>
<p>She has always been good at being coquettish, and her body’s flexibility has become super good because she did yoga every day. Shen Yichong’s expression changed!</p>
<p>“Let go, the door isn’t closed yet,” Shen Rui could break in any second.</p>
<p>“No~ I just want to have a nice talk with you…” replied Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“…then put your legs down.”</p>
<p>“I’ll let go if you promise me!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong kissed her lips directly to silence her. He lifted her up by the waist and hugged her whole body. He walked to the door of the room and closed the door with a kick.</p>
<p>“Aww, what a villain. Must I use my body in exchange for you to agree?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately covered the collar of her pajamas with a look of panic. She was very involved in the play. The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. He glanced at the little girl who was sleeping like a little angel on the cot next to them. It felt like he still had a long way to go to prevent his little girl from learning from her mother.</p>
<p>With a dark face, he put Yu Yaoyao on the bed.</p>
<p>“Lower your voice.”</p>
<p>How was she not embarrassed to say those R-18 words in front of their daughter? He knew that if Shen Dacheng… No, that fan club president came to the house as a guest, it was easy to have this kind of problem.</p>
<p>Originally, after giving birth to Little Sweetheart, Yu Yaoyao had become a lot more serious. But recently, it seemed that the latest plot of the president’s novel was about s*x, and it evoked Yu Yaoyao’s obscene imagination. Once she started, she couldn’t be stopped!</p>
<p>“Naww, you not only want me to make noise, but you also have a requirement for how loud I should be~” she said playfully. “Mr. Shen, you’re like a devil at night, so bad~”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, “…Do you still want to go out to work? Think about it and talk properly.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao m*aned twice. “Sir, I was wrong…” then, “Were my groans okay? Do you want me to be softer? Please, let me serve you. Give me a job and have mercy on me. I still have to support my family.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s temple bursted with pain.</p>
<p>“Sir, can we start quickly? Otherwise, my son will find out about you and me when he comes back~ I can’t let him see it, noooo.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a deep breath and pressed her to the sheet! Tonight, he must teach her a lesson!</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next day, Yu Yaoyao woke up satisfied. She stretched while feeling extremely refreshed.</p>
<p>Everyone said that having children will affect the relationship between husband and wife to a certain extent, and it would make a romantic relationship turn into kinship. After spending so much time on the baby other than the originally busy schedule, there would be no time and space left for each other.</p>
<p>But she was inspired by Shen Dacheng’s new chapter yesterday. Some excitement was still needed from time to time between husband and wife,  to maintain the romance.</p>
<p>Yesterday, she successfully diverted Shen Yichong’s attention away from Little Sweetheart! Last night, he also promised her that she could go out and work. He also promised that he would look out for scripts for her!</p>
<p>Perfect~ Her plan was a great success! Hehe!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blissfully turned over. She rolled directly to the side of the bed and smiled when she saw that Little Sweetheart that was still sleeping.</p>
<p>“Baby, when you grow up, Mommy will teach you these crucial skills~”</p>
<p>And Shen Yichong, who was already up, was also sharing his reasons with Shen Rui.</p>
<p>“Instead of letting her indulge in novels at home, it is better to let her go to work, read more scripts, and get in touch with people,” he began. “Little Sweetheart is old enough to stop breastfeeding, and you are going to school soon. Your mother would have no one to accompany her at home.”</p>
<p>Little Bun never wanted his Mommy to take on too much work. But recently, he has slowly changed his mind. Especially when he realized his Mommy had been laughing weirdly at the screen.  He finally agreed with his father’s opinion.</p>
<p>“Okay, daddy. It was my fault before,” Little bun admitted. “As long as Mommy likes it and is not tired, I support Mommy’s decision!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong patted his son with relief. “You’ve grown up.”</p>
<p>Compared to his wife who was addicted to reading novels, his son was much more sensible.</p>
<p>As a result, Yu Yaoyao’s free time was soon filled with a bunch of scripts. At least 200 files were sent to her email, and Shen Yichong asked her to read it slowly.</p>
