            <p><strong>Chapter 253 – How to Cheat (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was lost for words. The audience, however, had seen this coming. They didn’t know if they should laugh or cry for her. But fans of Yu Yaoyao had enormous faith in her capabilities. So, they chose to post some encouraging words:</p>
<p><strong>【Be strong, Miss Y! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Don’t be afraid, Miss Y is invincible, and you can find Boss Shen with five YUAN! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【News: The singer’s family has 584 YUAN; Da Fu’s family has 638 YUAN; and Yaoyao’s family has 5 YUAN…… Oh, it’s okay, we’ll strike back in the end! 】</strong></p>
<p>The staff finally finished all the formalities and informed the shocked Yu Yaoyao that they would be leaving and that she would be accompanied by the cameraman who would be filming her all the way but he was instructed to not provide any kind of help to hinder the broadcast.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao bit her lower lip and shook Shen Rui’s hands at them, emulating a goodbye. They looked so miserable and abandoned. Shen Yichong, who had been watching everything, felt sentimental.</p>
<p>“Five Yuan is too little,” he said to Director Zhao, “at least, give them cab fare from the airport to the hotel.” She had a child with her, and he didn’t know if she could follow the directions on the map. She was pretty bad with directions. Director Zhao waved his hands. “Oh, she will catch you on the plane.”</p>
<p>In the waiting room at the airport, after the staff left, Yu Yaoyao turned to the cameraman. A smile touched her lips. It was Brother Zheng! “Brother Zheng!” she exclaimed, “it’s you!”</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng nodded. “Miss Yu,” he acknowledged.</p>
<p>“Just call me Yaoyao,” she said, “Is it your duty to film us today? Do you have to do anything else?”</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng shook his head. “I’ll just follow you, don’t worry,” he said, “My job is to follow you wherever you go and get it on video. But I am not supposed to help you or give you hints. So sorry.” He had made it clear that he couldn’t break any rules for her sake. It was, therefore, useless to get emotional.</p>
<p>Shen Rui reached out his little hands. “Then let’s pinky promise!” he said excitedly, “that we won’t be separated.”</p>
<p>The kid melted Mr. Zheng’s heart. He leaned down and extended his pinky, entwining it with Shen Rui’s. “Okay! You should follow uncle and not run about, okay?” He had been a cameraman all his life and had shot for many variety shows but was rarely acknowledged warmly.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was giggling now. He was trying to suppress her laughter but failing at it. Mr. Zheng was confused. Meanwhile, Shen Yichong, watching the live footage, was astounded as well. She was a big softie, so he thought that she would end up crying without money and the food. He pressed his temples.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao leaned down and removed her pink sneaker. She picked up something wrapped in a tissue from inside her shoe. It was a 100 Yuan banknote! Mr. Zheng was speechless and astonished.</p>
<p>“So, Brother Zheng,” began Yu Yaoyao, “Since you clarified that you would be doing nothing but filming us, that means no blabbing or snitching. Please don’t go back on your words.” Yu Yaoyao put the banknote in order and looked at Mr. Zheng. Little Bun immediately followed suit and nodded. “Uncle, you can’t go back on your words!”</p>
<p>The viewers were having too much fun. Their comments under the live broadcast were testament to that:</p>
<p><strong>【Ha ha ha ha ha! Sorry, I can’t stop! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【My hands are shaking for laughing……My pickled Chinese sauerkraut instant noodles just spilled! Owwww! 】</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Zheng nodded an affirmative. Director Zhao, in his car, accepted Yu Yoayao’s antics with great difficulty.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Yu Yaoyao leaned down yet again and took off the other shoe and took out a roll of banknotes that were hidden inside her socks. Then Little Bun sat down and took off his shoes as well. They had banknotes hidden inside their shoes, wrapped in tissue. Seven Banknotes in total! It perhaps exceeded the amount that was allocated to the other families as well.</p>
<p>“Ho ho, I’ve watched a lot of these shows, okay?” said Yu Yaoyao happily. She carefully unfolded the money and put them in order. She then turned to the camera and said, “Director Zhao,” she addressed him, “Perhaps you haven’t watched as many shows as I have.” She raised her hand for a high-five with her son. “Let’s go get some snacks, Bun.”</p>
<p>Little Bun was practically jumping in joy as he followed his mother. Meanwhile, Mr. Zheng, Director Zhao, and Shen Yichong were shocked into silence. She hadn’t even left the airport, and the viewers in the live broadcast studio couldn’t help but burst into laughter. Nothing like this had ever happened before.</p>
