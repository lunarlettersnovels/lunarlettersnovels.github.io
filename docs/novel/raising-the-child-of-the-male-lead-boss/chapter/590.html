<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 163 – A Laugh Riot (1)</strong></p>
<p>The 360-degree aerial view of CEO Shen’s villa appeared on the screen and Zhao Xiaomeng, who was nibbling on the chips, screamed excitedly. The drone from DJI Chinese Technology Company almost captured the entire duplex villa</p>
<p>The pristine villa was sitting by the serene lake, before a mountain with the blue sky and white clouds. The scene felt so calm, serene and heavenly that it seemed to be an abode of fairies!</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng’s eyes flashed at the wonderful scenery. Several people started to comment and kept calling CEO Shen `daddy`, as seen in the comment section. Needless to say, Shen Yichong’s wealth drove people crazy.</p>
<p>Soon, as the camera shifted, the door was knocked open and a handsome but lazy man in languid pajamas who had apparently just taken a shower appeared on the screen.  Fans screamed in less than a second and soon filled the comment section.</p>
<p><strong>[Ah, who is this handsome guy? Am dead already?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[YYY, I’m so jealous to the point that it’s making me crazy! This is the richest and most powerful husband ever!? He’s so handsome!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Fuck, I’m one step late! I want a husband like him!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Oh my gosh! I felt suffocated in that moment!]</strong></p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng looked at the comments and laughed. She’d seen Shen Yichong at the filming site ‘In the Limelight’ before. At that time, she thought that Mr. Shen was indeed a strict person. No doubt he was very handsome, but of course, the beauty of her elder sister was the only thing that could match his handsomeness.</p>
<p>She couldn’t hold herself back, and with itchy hands, she made a comment.</p>
<p><strong>[Sister YYY’s beauty makes me more jealous of President Shen.]</strong></p>
<p>Her comment instantly drowned under the wave of comments that followed.</p>
<p>As soon as the photographer entered the house, he shot a long panoramic shot of the exquisite decoration in the villa. With the exception of the private bedrooms, the dining, study, living, and even the small garden and swimming pool outside were captured. The viewers screamed in awe and amazement.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng was a little astonished, but she couldn’t help laughing when she heard President Shen say that Yu Yaoyao had yet to wake up.</p>
<p><em>As always, Sister Yu loves her beauty sleep. When we were filming together, she would waste no opportunity to lie down and take a nap every time.</em></p>
<p>Upon seeing Shen Yichong enter the study and deal with his work, Zhao Xiaomeng ate potato chips in large chunks. She even got up and poured a glass of water, waiting for the moment Yu Yaoyao would appear on the screen. But soon, before she’d even reached the table, she heard the voices of her idol and Baby Rui coming from the computer.</p>
<p>‘’Husband, I’m so hungry…’</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng’s eyes lit up and she turned back to the screen immediately! At a glance, she saw Yu Yaoyao’s face with rosy cheeks and her skin was as white as snow. Even the scene where her delicate body fell on Shen Yichong’s back, and she let her husband carry her like a child was filmed. The lovely SpongeBob pajamas she wore did not make her less stunning but in fact, added to her cuteness!</p>
<p><strong>[Ow! She’s just wearing plain pajamas! I am wrong, right?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Goddess, her hair is messy, but she’s still beautiful!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[My God, she looks like a model even though she’s just wearing pajamas, I hate it! I want to cry!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Suck the face value!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[“Breaks down”, do you think her chest… is so big… oh my, stick it on President Shen’s back, her curve’s obviously the same as a Coca-cola bottle! Mr. Shen’s expression is so subtle, hahahaha! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen’s back: Oh, so soft and comfortable fufufu~]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[YYY: Husband, I am hungry, it’s time for breakfast…]</strong></p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng was smiling tenderly, just like an aunt looking at her beloved niece.</p>
<p><em>In the competition, she was very tough and almost drove Meng Xinran crazy. Now, with her eyes closed, she came out and asked her husband for food!</em> <em>Sister Yu, how can you be so cute in private?</em></p>
<p>But not long after, Shen Yichong pushed Yu Yaoyao into the bedroom, who was only wearing pajamas. He also pushed the camera lens away with one hand.</p>
<p><em>‘Don’t shoot!’</em></p>
<p>Soon after that scene, Shen Yichong’s face was edited and instantly became a meme. His jealous face was really comic and absurd!</p>
<p><strong>[Hahaha! Mr. Shen is a wife slave!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Shen is always domineering!]</strong></p>
<p>Back on the aired episode, Shen Yichong personally cooked for Yu Yaoyao and his son, and then asked the director, staff and cameramen to order takeout. This differential treatment made netizens laugh out loud.</p>
<p>Netizens didn’t feel bored watching. Whatever Yu Yaoyao did was entertaining. Especially the part where she was lying down and was grabbed by Shen Yichong forcing her to memorize her script and was even tasked to recite her three-paged script; and how she went to eat grape-flavored jelly halfway, and said grapes instead of melons in her recitation…</p>
<p>The netizens couldn’t hold it anymore. Everything was so humorous as if they were watching a comedy show.</p>
<p><strong>[Goddess, I will buy that grape-flavored jelly! I will remember it!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[She eats potato chips, high-calorie pudding and jellies and yet she does not look fat at all!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I cannot stand it! Yu Yaoyao, your funny actions are carved in my mind. I can’t stop laughing at everything you do!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen: I knew… so I punished my wife to do yoga for one hour.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Hahaha, don’t you think the moment the goddess was caught by her husband, looks like a little man’s face discovered by his father doing bad things?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I almost spat on the screen! How can there be such a funny person!?]   </strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen: Can’t take it anymore… hahaha!]</strong></p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng looked at the screen and burst into tears while laughing. The interaction between the couple was really cute, and the comments from the netizens were equally entertaining. She couldn’t resist joining and sent a hahaha!</p>
<p>In the last hour of the episode, everyone laughed until their stomach ached. Soon, when they felt that there were no longer entertaining scenes, everyone realized that they were wrong!</p>
<p>When they heard him reciting Yu Yaoyao’s script by just listening, they discovered that CEO Shen’s IQ was too high. Also, Yu Yaoyao’s face of amazement was very cute… The scene where she watched a replay of ‘In the Limelight’, and kept on complimenting her beauty, and that she could no longer press the remote control was shown as well… everyone of these moments sent the audience on a laugh riot, they felt they could die from laughing!</p>
