            <p><strong>Chapter 415</strong></p>
<p>The words of Little Bun expressed the confidence he had in his appearance and his displease towards his father’s appearance. His comments made Shen Yichong’s face darker. Little Bun felt a little chill as soon as he finished speaking. He quickly rubbed Yu Yaoyao’s arm and tilted his chubby body to hide his bottom.</p>
<p>When he looked back at Shen Yichong, his dark eyes were full of tension. “I didn’t talk nonsense, daddy.”</p>
<p>Little Bun had a strong desire to survive.</p>
<p>“You are a man. If my little sister looked like you, wouldn’t she look boyish?” He looked sad and depressed as he spoke. “She should look like Mommy, or me, at least.”</p>
<p>He stretched out his hand to touch his cheeks and his slightly bulging belly. Then, he nodded surely.</p>
<p>“She’ll be cuter if she looks like me. She wouldn’t look like a girl if she looked like daddy.”</p>
<p>Little Bun felt even more depressed the more he thought about it. What was the point of having a sister that looked like his father, after waiting for so long? He had to say it even if he would end up being beaten by his father. He wanted a cute and soft sister.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a deep breath and chose to leave. Talking to his son would make him go mad. He went to prepare a fruit platter, and he left a sentence before leaving.</p>
<p>“This is my daughter, not yours. If you want a baby girl to look like you, sure, get yourself a wife to give birth to.”</p>
<p>This sentence almost angered Little Bun. On the other hand, the sentence made the fans in the live broadcast room go crazy. The couple had not given any specific information before, and this was the first time that the s*x of the baby was disclosed.</p>
<p><strong>[Our precious baby is a girl. Perfect!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Wow, I always thought it would be a naughty boy because it still stayed healthy after going through so much. What a surprise!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[A soft and beautiful version of Mr. Shen.. HAHAHAH! Sure! I bet the baby would look really good!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Looking forward to it!!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I’m envious that Yaoyao has both a son and daughter~ I hope to see the interaction of the four as a family in the future.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Little Bun: I’m so tired. From now on, I’ve to take care of both my daddy and my little sister. I can’t do it. I can’t do it anymore!]</strong></p>
<p>The fans were very excited and happy.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao comforted Shen Rui. She told him his little sister would look like both his father and mother, and she would even look a little like him. Hearing this made Little Bun feel more at ease. But as soon as he turned around, Little Bun took out his tablet and started searching.</p>
<p><em>#How to make the baby in Mommy’s belly look cute#</em></p>
<p>All the audience heard him speak, and many fans who were mothers found him so cute!</p>
<p>Now that having a second child was allowed, many rich families who had the time and energy also wanted a second baby. However, they were afraid that their child wouldn’t be able to accept it and would compete with the younger one. But Shen Rui wasn’t even worrying about falling out of favor. Instead, he sincerely wanted a cute little sister who would play with him. He even took a lot of careful thinking about this matter.</p>
<p>After a while, he finally found the information as he wished. He guessed the general meaning of the words he found. He would also secretly ask Ren Sitong when he didn’t understand something. Ren Sitong answered and smiled while covering her mouth.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at Little Bun curiously. “So, what should I do? Does it say something online?” she asked.</p>
<p>Shen Rui nodded immediately. “Mommy, wait for me for a while.”</p>
<p>He lowered his head and fiddled with his tablet for a while before he showed it to Yu Yaoyao. Yu Yaoyao took it and found that he had downloaded a lot of pictures of cute girls. Among them, many were childhood photos of various female artists.</p>
<p>“The Internet said mommy must look more at beautiful stuff.”</p>
<p>Little Bun skillfully took Yu Yaoyao’s phone and changed her background image into a photo of an adorable baby girl. He even squeezed his chin very maturely at the end.</p>
<p>“But mommy can’t look at your phone often. I’ll get daddy to print the images out and paste them at home so that Mommy can see them often.”</p>
<p>Little Bun was very thoughtful. “If daddy doesn’t care, I’ll take care of it.”</p>
<p>He even found a reason for himself. He had completely forgotten what Shen Yichong said that almost pissed him off.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao laughed out loud, “Sure! I’ll pass this task to you.”</p>
<p>The last time she went to kindergarten, she heard from the teacher on how to educate children and cultivate their sense of responsibility. She felt that Little Bun was really talented and full of responsibility. Not sure if these characteristics of his were inherited from Shen Yichong, or he had been taught well. Yu Yaoyao only knew that this child made her feel at ease.</p>
<p>When Little Bun went to pester Shen Yichong to print the photos, Ren Sitong looked at Yu Yaoyao enviously.</p>
<p>“I suspect your son is an adult who has time travelled from the future,” she began. “My son doesn’t know anything. He’s 5 years old, and all he does is play and eat. How sensible your son is! Although he could be a little silly at times, he is really cute.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao beamed. “Yeah~ He’s very awesome! I knew my Little Bun would be a good boy the first time I saw him. I made up my mind to raise him well at the time,” she exclaimed. “He’s so cute I could cry!”</p>
<p>“You liked him at first sight?” asked a curious Ren Sitong. “Impressive. When I saw my son for the first time, I was like ‘Wow, he looks like a wrinkled red monkey!’…I just wanted to cry looking at him.”</p>
