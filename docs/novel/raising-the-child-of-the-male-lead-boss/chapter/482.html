            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 281 – Warm Soup (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>After finally reaching home, Yu Yaoyao decided to stay in and rest. She had no intention or the energy to do anything at all. The whole duration of the filming of ‘My Wife and I’ had made her exhausted.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had become a different man entirely. He spared no opportunity to shower her with affection. Her days and her nights were filled with such intimacy that her whole body ached these days.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao now had a friend to complain to. “He used to be like a monk, but he has changed so much,” said Yu Yaoyao to Ren Sitong, “Can’t say I mind, though.” She giggled.</p>
<p>Ren Sitong laughed with her. “You are the one who said all he did was work, in the show,” she said, chuckling, “Now he is adamant to show you he knows more than that. I told you. Men are like kids; they can be very childish. But I am sure you are happy about it. Trying something new every day.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao frowned, thinking. “Something new?” she wondered about the script that Director Qi Hang had sent her yesterday. He had said that he revised the character sketch of the second female lead. She had read the script and cried that night. She felt immensely sorry for the character. “Does a woman have to come up with new things to please her husband always, so he doesn’t leave? That sounds very unfair,” said Yu Yaoyao, thinking about cheating husbands and curious how families reached such a painful point.</p>
<p>“It is unfair,” Ren Sitong said, “Having to do things differently every time, preparing small surprises so he can’t leave you. But not always, sometimes you find people you love, who love you equally.”</p>
<p>The reason why Ren Sitong and Qiu Dafu were selected by the ‘My Wife and I’ show was because they were a well-known, happy couple in the community. After a two-year relationship, they had married. Now, after eight years of marriage, they had a son who had just entered elementary school and a daughter who was a year younger than Shen Rui.</p>
<p>“We are the same,” said Ren Sitong, “My husband is also very introverted. So I feel like I have to take care of a lot of things. Let me tell you. Men like these? We need to take the initiative, otherwise they will always remain reserved and quiet.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong thought a while. “Why don’t you cook something for him and visit him in his office?” she suggested, “It will be a very pleasant surprise.”</p>
<p>It made sense. “But what should I cook?” Yu Yaoyao asked.</p>
<p>“Soup, maybe,” Ren Sitong said, “It’s the easiest. You just throw whatever you have in it, set it for a day, and it’s pretty much done. Who knows? He might be home even earlier than usual to spend more intimate time with you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blushed. Although she had finally found a friend, she was still shy to share personal details of her life. She hung up after talking for a while and googled up a recipe for some delicious chicken soup.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong sensed that something was different. Whenever he came home and pushed her against the pillow, he smelled chicken on her. When he kissed her, her breath tasted of chicken as well. But they didn’t have chicken for dinner every day. “Did you snack on something?” he asked her once.</p>
<p>“Nope,” she said, shaking her head. She raised her legs and crossed it across his waist, pulling him close. His mind went blank after that. It was just impossible to talk. When he woke up in the morning, she would still be asleep.</p>
<p>After a few days, Yu Yaoyao had her rainy-day forecast. She put on a blue lacy dress and draped a cobalt-blue coat over it. She took a bottle of red wine and glasses for her and him. She packed the chicken soup that she had stewed the night before and left her place. Rainy day, red wine and soup — it was going to be such a romantic lunch!</p>
<p>It had been a long time since she had been to Guangxin Entertainment. She used to be a regular there when she was an artist on contract for the agency. When she entered, everyone inside stopped their work and stared at her. The lady at the front desk smiled at her respectfully. “Ms. Yu,” she asked, “Are you here to see President Shen?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled back and nodded. “Yes,” she said, “Do I need to make an appointment?”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” the receptionist said with a smile, “I will give Chen Lin a call. He will pick you up from here and take you to meet the President. Please give me a moment.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright,” she said, “You don’t need to call. I will just go up.” The receptionist smiled and ushered her to the elevator. She pressed the button for the 18th floor. “The door that you will see in front of you right after you exit the elevator is Mr. Shen’s office. If the boss is in a meeting, Chen Lin will be sitting outside the door. Have a nice day.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much,” said Yu Yaoyao gratefully. She adjusted her hair, looking at her reflection on the elevator door. The elevator dinged and opened.</p>
<p>“Boss?” she heard Chen Lin say.</p>
<p>“Hi,” she said happily. Chen Lin was sitting near the door.</p>
<p>Chen Lin was stunned, seeing her at the office. “Sis, what are you doing here?” he asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“I am here to see your boss for lunch,” she said, cheerfully.</p>
