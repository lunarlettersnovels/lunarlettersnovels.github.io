<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 123 – Pampered Madam, Or Not</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong took half a day off. He initially planned to Yu Yaoyao finish her recording and send her back to the hotel before departing to the company. However, he did not expect that the woman who was so rambunctious on hooking up with him just this morning would catch a cold and a fever after lunch.</p>
<p>Such was a menacing sight before him. Yu Yaoyao’s body was fragile than he thought, yet she still had the courage to soak herself in winter.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong heard the news, he felt the situation was somewhat ironic.</p>
<p>Before, he thought that she wasn’t a hard-working person. She only wanted to laze around and couldn’t even hold a proper conversation with him.</p>
<p>But now… she managed to confuse him for the first time; he couldn’t fathom her thoughts any longer. After five years of being away from the spotlight, she cherished the opportunity to work again and devoted herself faithfully to the craft.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps she’s using this unorthodox method to catch me off guard so she can swindle more money,</em> he thought, frowning slightly.</p>
<p>“Let’s return to the studio.” He told the driver and asked Chen Lin to call the family doctor to wait at the hotel.</p>
<p>When he arrived on scene, Shen Yichong saw a pale Yu Yaoyao, holding a plastic bag on the verge of vomiting with bloodshot eyes, and his eyebrows couldn’t help but rise. He clearly remembered when he left at noon, she still had a good appetite and was eating the lunch box prepared by the crew.</p>
<p>“Director, I’ll take her back to see a doctor.” Shen Yichong stepped forward towards the chief director and directly said so.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao then choked on her vomit and heaved violently. She held the bag like a pitiful patient, unable to stop her coughing.</p>
<p>The chief director immediately waved his hands, “Yes, she can go home first. She’s finished with all of her shots anyway,” and opened the door for their convenience.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stretched out a hand and caressed her back, which was shaking from severe coughing, trying to soothe her.</p>
<p>“If it turns to be serious, she might take a few more days off. I will bear the losses of the program team if such an event occurs.”</p>
<p>After he said this, everyone who heard it couldn’t help but look in askance.</p>
<p>The rental fees for the filming sets, the fees for all the heavyweight judges, and the salaries of so many people in the program… delaying a day or two means burning money reaching millions. But Shen Yichong can obviously spend such amount, and this money is obviously nothing in his eyes.</p>
<p>Everyone can’t help but look at the delicate Yu Yaoyao. There was an irrefutable envy for the attention this woman was getting.</p>
<p><em>Her life is fortunate! Her marriage is good!</em></p>
<p>As soon as her husband heard that she was sick, he came to pick up her up in person, and even offered to pay for losses just so his wife can rest for a few more days.</p>
<p>This is simply one of the few rich, good men in the world! And to think, before, they even thought she would cheat.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the director was also very frank, “If there’s any changes, please contact me at any time. She can catch up with her scenes in the future. And it’s no problem, she performed very well today—I hear some talks between the judges that she might be the first to receive a ticket to the next round.”</p>
<p>His implication was that Yu Yaoyao wouldn’t need to come join the next two games. Only, he loathed giving her less screen time as her presence was a natural attraction for the viewers. Just from last night’s broadcast, her topic had been the hardest, and with her, the ratings of the program kept rising.</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>In the middle of the conversation, they heard a quiet, depressed cry. A type of cry that was full of sadness and unbearable grievances.</p>
<p>Everyone looked back and saw Yu Yaoyao holding the garbage bag… genuinely crying. Her mouth was curved to a downward arc as tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, elder sister? Do you feel uncomfortable?” Have another sip of ginger tea.” Ni Yi anxiously hurried to make her feel better.</p>
<p>But he was only answered with a loud sob from Yu Yaoyao. It was as if the floodgates of tears had been opened!</p>
<p>“Noooo… I threw up the noon meal… chicken drumsticks, fish chops, ah, and… I just ate… my favorite pudding… and spit it out.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao cried as if she is suffering from heartache; the sound truly conveying her current mood. Her tears and snot almost mixing as they dripped down.</p>
<p>“I actually wasted such delicious food…” As she cried, she looked down the plastic bag in her arms. She immediately felt lethargic and wanted to faint.</p>
<p>Ni Yi felt as if he was going to drop dead, even the other staff members were shocked!</p>
<p>Everyone then remembered her first live broadcast. She played a poor madam and said that she often did not have enough to eat. Everyone’s mouth opened.</p>
<p>They all thought she was just acting that day!</p>
