        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 109 – Take a Beating</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s voice drifted from the video, her next statement in extreme fierceness:</p>
<p><em>‘I’ll give you two choices: one, f*ck off now and drop the b*tch’s name who gave you money; two, you get out of here this instant and bring me a take out.’</em></p>
<p>The man suddenly looked at her with uncertainty, almost amazed. <em>‘Aren’t you drugged?’ You don’t look like i–’</em></p>
<p>In the next second, a man’s shriek and the indignant cries of Yu Yaoyao came from the video.</p>
<p><em>‘Drug? You dare! Drug your ancestors!’</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, holding a tablet in her hands, crazily hit the man with it. <em>‘Did I allow you to lie to me? Don’t even think about dr*gging me! Are you going to get me a meal or not?! You are wasting my precious time supposedly for beauty sleep! I want to eat a snack, I want to eat instant noodles! I’ll give you ten minutes starting now, or I’ll finish you tonight!’</em></p>
<p>She slammed the man to the side and towards the cupboard. The man subconsciously glanced at the glass cabinet and was driven into a state of shock; he was immediately like scared silly by what he saw!</p>
<p>He held his head in his arms and cried loudly. Finally, he ran into the door in a panic. ‘I-I-I’ll buy you snack—some instant noodles! Just let me go! Open the door and let me go! Oh, my God! Just stay away from me!’</p>
<p>The man turned pale with fear, and it was only then she finally opened the door.</p>
<p>After the other party rushed to get away, Yu Yaoyao could be seen walking back towards the living room in the footage. She arranged her bangs, tidied her hair that had gone unkempt and looked at the tablet in her hand, winking and smiling like a saint.</p>
<p><em>‘Husband. It’s okay. It was just some take out; I’m going to have a midnight snack before I go to bed.’</em> Yu Yaoyao placed her red lips near the tablet, blowing a kiss.</p>
<p>The people in the monitoring room who saw this all swallowed their saliva.</p>
<p><em>The couple is really in love with each other.</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong coughed softly with his clenched fist on his lips, “Fast forward.”</p>
<p>But he said it too late.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s tantalizing voice suddenly came from the video, <em>‘Husband, you should sleep early. It’s not good for your health to be thinking of me all the time when I’m away. Just sleep already, you’ll probably dream of me.’</em></p>
<p>All of a sudden, it was as if they had eaten a mouthful of dog food, and Shen Yichong ears turned red!</p>
<p>Only Meng Xinran looked at the monitor and stared in disbelief.</p>
<p><em>How could this man be so weak? Shouldn’t he have put Yu Yaoyao in bed? How could he have been beaten up like that? Most importantly, how is she still sober?!</em></p>
<p>After fast-forwarding the video, in less than ten minutes, the man was back to her room again. He was still deathly afraid, and after leaving the box of instant noodles, he hurriedly escaped again!</p>
<p>The two did nothing at all.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao entirely enthralled the deputy director and the staff. Even the two male policemen present expressed their admiration for her.</p>
<p>“This self-defense technique is so powerful! I didn’t expect the female star to be so heroic!”</p>
<p>“By the way, the police will publicize this as women’s self-defense in the future. With you as the endorser, of course.”</p>
<p>As soon as Yu Yaoyao heard the words “publicize” and “endorser”, she thought of how her fans would increase and nodded happily. “It’s no problem; it is everyone’s responsibility to spread awareness.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at the police with a calm face, “Officers, the man in the video had malicious intentions against my wife. It also sounds like someone is contacting him to do this. That person wanted to drug my wife tonight.”</p>
<p>The police who came to the scene immediately took the evidence and the videotape away. “Rest assured, Mr. Shen, we will search for this suspect in the city. We officers have seen a clear picture of his face and investigate whether there are any involved associates.”</p>
<p>The deputy director nodded, gratified that no accident had happened on the scene. But…</p>
<p>“Officers, we can’t stop filming, otherwise the contract with the venue and other artists will set us back a great loss with every passing day of the investigation. We do promise we will do our best to assist in the investigation. Will that be acceptable?”</p>
<p>Some people wanted to drug Yu Yaoyao and even hired an outsider to attack her. Especially since eighty percent of the people in the program were contestants, if the attack had succeeded, Yu Yaoyao would have faced downfall; her family marriage and all projects in the entertainment circle would have been  destroyed!</p>
<p>Someone who would greatly benefit from it should have orchestrated such a thing!</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes moved to Meng Xinran, finding her reactions tonight very strange.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran suddenly felt her back turn cold, her face miserably pale. “I, it’s not me… I just saw the photos on Weibo and misjudged sister Yu…  I was afraid the program would be suspended because of it. I-I want the program to continue for everyone’s good.”</p>
<p>The deputy director frowned slightly. “We’ll wait for the results of the police investigation.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran immediately shook.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt an icy stare bore into her. She looked up and saw Shen Yichong with an unsettling, expressionless gaze.</p>
