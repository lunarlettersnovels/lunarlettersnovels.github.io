            <p><strong>Chapter 476</strong></p>
<p>At this time, Fang Qiuye finally arrived at the scene. She was at the door of the small villa located in the suburb.</p>
<p>She grabbed her right hand that was about to ring the doorbell and wandered at the door!</p>
<p>“Hello, Yaoyao, I’m your fan ‘Gentle’!”</p>
<p>“Hello… I’m your temporary English teacher…”</p>
<p>“Hello……”</p>
<p>She pondered the opening remarks over and over, and finally finalized her first sentence. Then, she began to wonder whether she should say it in English. When Fang Qiuye was entangled, the staff who followed her outside were also smiling bitterly.</p>
<p>“Do you need me to ring the doorbell for you?” one of them offered. “Don’t worry. Just treat yourself as a guest, and it’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye became even more nervous after hearing this, but she quickly made up her mind and nodded to the staff, “Then please do…My right hand is a little soft now and I can’t lift it up… I can’t ring the doorbell…”</p>
<p>“…Sure.”</p>
<p>At the door, the main recording was also switched to Fang Qiuye’s scene. What she said made the audience, who was in the midst of having diabetes, burst into laughter instantly. When the staff rang the doorbell, Yu Yaoyao, who had been lying down for a while, finally regained her physical strength. She came out and opened the door.</p>
<p>“Wow, darling! Big Head is here.” Yaoyao’s  excited voice already came from the door before anyone came out.</p>
<p><em>‘Big Head?’ </em>Fang Qiuye was at a loss for a moment. She looked up at the cameraman and the staff member and nodded. She must be talking about them. However,  Fang Qiuye’s mind was instantly hazy as soon as the door opened.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked so much better in person! It may be that she had been recuperating at home for a while, her cheeks were a little pinkish and smooth. They even looked a little plump. But her slender waist donning a skirt did not look like she had just given birth to a baby at all.</p>
<p>There were so many descriptions of women’s appearance that crossed Fang Qiuye’s brain. It was a proclivity she got from being a writer… As a writer on the Internet, her brain would uncontrollably think about huge paragraphs of words all day, especially when she was excited. She really wished she could write everything into her novel, so her readers can also feel it!</p>
<p>“He…Hello…”</p>
<p>While Fang Qiuye’s brain was active, her mouth was stuck. She had forgotten all the opening remarks she practiced! And before she finished speaking, she was being hugged into a warm embrace with a slightly milky fragrance!</p>
<p>“Big Head, you’re finally here~” Yaoyao welcomed her enthusiastically. “We’ve been waiting for you for a long time. Please come in!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s mind suddenly froze. “Big…Big Head…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah~” Yu Yaoyao covered her mouth and snickered. Then, she pulled her hand. “You’re still hiding it from me? Aren’t you my No. 1 fan? I know you! You’ve been writing a lot of compliments to me on Weibo. I read them carefully every day. I couldn’t surf the internet when I finished giving birth to Little Sweetheart. But I read them all in one go after my confinement period.”</p>
<p>As she said that, she raised her eyes with mischievous eyes, “<em>‘Good morning, Yaoyao. Today is another day when I’m attracted to your eyes that look like the Milky Way. Those who say the stars are beautiful must have never seen your eyes…’</em>”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye blushed to the extreme! Although she was a writer, she didn’t even tell her friends the name she used as an author. She always thought it would be very shameful if her words were seen by her friends! She usually relied on her two-dimensional vest to speak freely!</p>
<p>Now that these extremely cheesy words were read out by her idol on the spot, Fang Qiuye’s heart thumped fast, and she felt like she was on cloud nine!</p>
<p>“Alright now. Please come into the house. I’m all ready! Today, it’s just the two of us. It’ll be one-on-one study. No one will disturb us,” Yaoyao said.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye staggered and almost threw herself on Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Be careful.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s face was flushed. “I’m..I’m sorry. My legs got a little weak…”</p>
<p>Instead of being angry, Yu Yaoyao’s eyes brightened, “Ah, I know! It was you who wrote <em>‘I saw the goddess’ face across the screen, and my legs felt as if I stepped on soft cotton candy when I walked out of the theater. Without the slightest strength left, I knelt down to the goddess.’</em>…” Yaoyao recited. “That’s okay! Come, I’ll help you!”</p>
<p>In the end, Fang Qiuye was helped into the house by Yu Yaoyao. All the fans in the live broadcast room almost went crazy with jealousy!</p>
<p>Was it too late if they started writing praises for her every day?</p>
