            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 95 – The Cost of Beauty</strong></p>
<p>Chen Jiao looked at her icily and moved forward to grab her injured wrist, “How far have you gone with each other? Talk!” He added viciously, “Hugging? No, did you kiss him? Or…did you even go as far as to get into bed with him?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s frame shook as she looked up at the man’s peach blossom eyes. Two lines of crystal tears streamed down her beautiful face and her red lips trembled, and it was hard to even close her eyes.</p>
<p>The next moment she opened her mouth, a wry smile was in place. “Do you also think I like Chen Jiao? That I had an affair with him?” she asked, her face full of grievances.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s palm felt as if it had been scalded by her words in an instant.</p>
<p><em>She even included him in her lines!? </em>The audience was immediately in an uproar. Meanwhile, Meng Xinran was almost tearing through her fingernails in exhilaration!</p>
<p>But Chen Jiao suddenly loosened his hold on Yu Yaoyao’s hand and she fell to the ground. There was only bitterness and mocking in his face as he looked down at her.</p>
<p>“I like Chen Jiao? But I am already married to you.”</p>
<p>She opened her mouth feebly to breath a deep sigh as a tear rolled down her eyes like a broken pearl. “To be regarded as the world’s most precious, most beautiful, and rarest face… a beautiful face that tempts and moves the hearts of all men–”</p>
<p>She touched her face and laughed bitterly as she cried.</p>
<p>“It’s all dedicated to you.”</p>
<p>The whole audience almost burst to laughter at her lines. <em>How narcissistic this is!</em></p>
<p>“If I like Chen Jiao… then why did I even offer my most beautiful self to you?!” She suddenly looked up, a bit disappointed flashed on her face but her heartache was visibly seen.</p>
<p>“Chen Jiao, although he is also a handsome man, but… I still have morals. I know who gives me food and who buys me the puddings I love.”</p>
<p>She smiled bitterly. “But you don’t believe me…”</p>
<p>“Get out then, I don’t want you anymore!” She stood up miserably, her body even shaking for a moment at the abrupt action. When she wobbled on her feet, Chen Jiao stretched out his hand, wanting to help her, but it was only greeted by a slap!</p>
<p>In just a snap, her eyes turned red. Like a small beast that had been bullied, the hair on her body stood up. “Don’t touch me!”</p>
<p>She hugged her shoulders as if she had been subjected to great torment, unable to bear the sadness at the moment, and then quietly stepped back. The corners of her mouth pulled to a small, sad smile. She looked towards the audience, her watery eyes looking like the autumn wind: bleak and cold.</p>
<p>“If I have the same wealth, the same status… will someone say that I married into a prestigious, rich family only for money?”</p>
<p>If she has the means for it, she will build herself a special zoo. A zoo where she is the only snake. Would she still be angry with the zookeeper? Not at all! If she doesn’t like him, then she will search for a new zookeeper!</p>
<p>As she spoke, her hands clasping her shoulders trembled. “In the end, I am still not strong enough; I am weak, so no matter what I do, I will be criticized and doubted.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s expression changed from sad to hurt, and then that of pain and resentment, “Even if somehow Chen Jiao becomes clear from my name, tomorrow it could be another man again…”</p>
<p>Because she could do nothing, the red panda next door would still be better loved than her even if they changed the zookeeper. For so many years, it has always been like this!</p>
<p>She touched the area above her heart and smiled bitterly at the audience.</p>
<p>“But it’s… it’s my fault that I’m so beautiful. So beautiful to the point I’ve incited the jealousy of many women, which makes so many men look in askance at me. After all, it’s the highest beauty—that’s what men want.”</p>
<p>Not all treasures can be appreciated by ordinary human beings. She’s too excellent that she far exceeds the aesthetic level of the zookeeper!</p>
<p>A line of clear tears glided across her neck. “It’s my fault.”</p>
