            <p><strong>Chapter 484</strong></p>
<p>“Author Shen Dacheng! Do you know that you’re popular?!” Xiaoqiao, who had just gotten up and was still in her pajamas with messy hair, shook Fang Qiuye’s shoulder excitedly. “Have you seen your author page!? Have you seen how many people have saved your works?! Have you seen your backend engagement!? You’re currently on the hot search. Film and television companies will surely notice you!”</p>
<p>“… What?”</p>
<p>As Xiaoqiao rattled news after news, Fang Qiuye’s hands on the keyboard trembled. Xiaoqiao then took out her own phone and showed it to her.</p>
<p>“I was sleeping when  six phone calls woke me up. All of the callers asked if I know you, and if I know that you’re now popular! Yaoyao is recommending you on her Weibo! She even read your novels on live broadcast, and the number of viewers on the live broadcast exceeded hundreds of thousands!!! Dacheng, my friends and I feel jealous to the point of suffocation!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s eyes widened, and she hurriedly opened her small bag and took out her phone. Because she was recording for the show, she didn’t watch the live broadcast herself. She didn’t know anything that happened in the live broadcast room. As soon as she looked at her phone, she found that notifications from the fan group kept popping out.</p>
<p>In addition to some comments that said that they were envious of the president, there were people saying, <em>‘… I also want to read the novels recommended by Yaoyao’, ‘What a coincidence, I’m also running out of books to read’ , ‘Yaoyao has posted on Weibo. Everyone, please support and subscribe to the author…”</em></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was stunned. While she was in shock, another message popped out.</p>
<p><em>[Teacher Gong: Are you free today? Let’s meet and talk.]</em></p>
<p>However, she was indeed running out of time. She had to rush her writing like there was no tomorrow. And soon, another message from Ye Yun popped out.</p>
<p><em>[Are you Shen Dacheng?!]</em></p>
<p>As expected of her high IQ, she never even told Ye Yun about her identity as an author! Nearly all her friends didn’t know about her author’s name, since she felt too ashamed to disclose it.  When Fang Qiuye was thinking about whether to confess her identity to Ye Yun, another message came in. It turned out to be her editor, Xiaomi.</p>
<p><em>[There are film and television companies interested to discuss rights with you. Are you available these days? How long till the old book ends? Are you preparing for the new book already? Don’t stop updating the old book, and please update a lot!]</em></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye opened her mouth wide. She pinched her face and felt a stinging pain!</p>
<p><em>‘I’m not dreaming…’</em></p>
<p>The editor rarely checked in with her. Even more… discussing film and television rights for her novel were things she had never imagined.</p>
<p>“Dacheng, you’re reaching the sky!” Xiaoqiao hugged her tighter, and she rubbed her face on her body. “I also want some of your luck! Dacheng! You must have saved the earth in your past life!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s mouth twitched as her body was completely at the mercy of her roommate. After thinking it over, she said, “No… it’s because I’m good at writing compliments.”</p>
<p>“… Huh?”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At nine o’clock in the evening, Yu Yaoyao was already waiting to read the latest chapter.</p>
<p>However, it seemed like Little Sweetheart was on her father’s side. Shestarted crying at nine o’clock on the dot, and she wouldn’t stop even when she was being coaxed. Whether it was Shen Rui or Shen Yichong who went up to hold the baby, they couldn’t make her stop crying. In the end, Shen Yichong could only shove the baby into Yu Yaoyao’s chest.</p>
<p>Little Sweetheart immediately stopped crying. She didn’t want to drink milk since she was fed half an hour ago. It seemed that she just wanted to be held by her mother. As soon as she was surrounded by Yu Yaoyao’s arms, Little Sweetheart puckered her small mouth and blinked her round, big eyes. Her long eyelashes looked like a moving hand fan. Then, as if she had found a good place to rest, she finally closed her eyes with satisfaction. She was absolutely adorable.</p>
<p>Although Yu Yaoyao really wanted to read the latest chapter, she had no choice but to delay it. Little Bun was also on the front with Shen Yichong this time.</p>
<p>“Mummy, it must be that you spent too little time with Little Sweetheart today. This is why she is not happy,” Little Bun said.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded in agreement. “Carry her more today. She must have cried because she didn’t feel safe.”</p>
<p>The father and son would do anything as long as Little Sweetheart stopped crying. Yu Yaoyao felt helpless.</p>
<p>“Won’t you spoil the baby if you act like this?” she said.</p>
<p>“We won’t,” The father and son replied in unison.</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>Although Yu Yaoyao also loved Little Sweetheart, she had read a lot of parenting books. She feared that she would spoil her if she hugged her too much, but she also feared Little Sweetheart would hurt her throat if she cried too much.</p>
<p><em>‘What a dilemma…’</em></p>
<p>But for now, she would just forget it and hold her. Since it seemed impossible for her to still be the first commenter, she gave up.</p>
<p>“Darling, can you click on it for me? Click on the voice reading, and I will just listen to it.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>The father and son spoke in unison again. After finishing speaking, the father and son even looked at each other.</p>
<p><em>‘Sure enough, Mommy will teach Little Sweetheart with weird stuff!’ </em>was what Little Bun thought.</p>
<p><em>‘Sure enough, my wife is about to sabotage Little Sweetheart’s standard in choosing her mate!’ </em>was what the husband thought.</p>
<p>No way!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stared at them, “What strange things are you father and son thinking about? I haven’t finished speaking yet. Give me another earpiece, I won’t let Little Sweetheart listen to it!”</p>
<p>The two father and son suddenly looked up at the sky, as if they hadn’t heard anything.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao: “Hello? Hey…! Hey?!”</p>
