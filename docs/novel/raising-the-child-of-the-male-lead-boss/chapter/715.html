            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 36 – Too Fierce!</strong></p>
<p>Seen from her side profile, a trace of resentment and helplessness against the emperor quickly emerged as she was pitifully crying.</p>
<p>Li Bo, sitting in front of the monitor, waved his hands excitedly in the air!</p>
<p><em>Perfect! Too good! </em>He internally complimented this magnificent take.</p>
<p>He had told her that there should be a trace of resentment in her sadness, but he wasn’t really expecting her to nail the acting spot on!</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s still good. After all, she’s doing the right thing!</p>
<p>Originally, the emperor had spoiled He Ling dearly soon after she entered the palace. But there wasn’t truly a concubine who loved the emperor genuinely. Although the emperor had given her all kinds of gifts, he didn’t even go see her before her violent death. Therefore, she should harbor a grudge against him.</p>
<p>Moreover, this scene is the emperor’s dream.</p>
<p>What was happening at the moment truly made things clearer on what was inside his heart. He was very cold to all the concubines, and this new promise, is truly nothing more than a tactic to warn the concubines in his harem. He Ling’s tragic death was also the result of his callousness.</p>
<p>In his heart, he also felt that she should hate him at this moment and not have feelings of love! His heart was rigid because he didn’t believe that these women would ever love him for who he really was and not for his title and riches.</p>
<p>Li Bo looked at the screen excitedly. “All right, it’s over! Once more, Wei Ming!”</p>
<p>The two people were opposite of each other on a couch. At first they shoot on corner A , which was the front part and next they would shoot from corner B.</p>
<p>In this way, both of their expressions can be filmed, and then edited and spliced into the final episode.</p>
<p>“Wei Ming, as the emperor, small promises such as the one from He Ling are just trivial matters in your heart. You never really cared on what happened to her, but when she cried, you remember her beauty on the many days you had spent with her; her tears and little mood swings.”</p>
<p>Li Bo talked more excitedly, “But in the end, after she asks you why you didn’t go see her, you completely pull away from your brief sadness. Because you are the emperor, and you are doomed to have no feelings in a world full of treacherous people.”</p>
<p>The experienced actor, Wei Ming smiled and signaled an OK pose.</p>
<p>He’s been acting for years, and he’s naturally erudite about these things. As soon as he reads his part in the script, he’ll know what the character’s mood is.</p>
<p>Yet at the moment, he was a little stiff in front of the camera.</p>
<p>Because as soon as he looked up, he saw Shen Yichong standing at the back, holding his child in his arms! And upon closer inspection, he was embarrassed to find that the other person’s face did not look very good at the moment.</p>
<p>Indeed, as soon as any man comes in to he see his wife on the chest of another man in an affectionate state, who wouldn’t be mad?!</p>
<p>Besides, his wife was rumored to have a dating scandal and almost made the headlines.</p>
<p>Even if he was only acting, Wei Ming did not know where to put his hand at the moment. After all, the child was also here. He shouldn’t put his arms around his mother and act too close lest he misinterprets it.</p>
<p>Wei Ming, who was also a dedicated father, knows far too well the meaning of Shen Yichong’s action of covering his son’s eyes.</p>
<p>And Shen Yichong, at a glance, understood Wei Ming’s unnatural, black face at him holding the steamed bun, and directly retreated to an inconspicuous part of the set.</p>
<p>Wei Ming immediately looked gratefully towards Shen Yichong and immediately nodded to Director Li Bo. “Let’s start now.”</p>
<p>The camera was adjusted to the other side to shot another angle.</p>
<p>As soon as the clapperboard was clipped, Yu Yaoyao threw herself into Wei Ming’s arms once more. And order to help him ease into the scene, she continued to recite her lines, just as she had just done before.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, why don’t you come and see your concubine for the last time?”</p>
<p>.Wei Ming looked up and was about to turn the traces of love in his expression into indifference, but his face turned stiff a second time.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyaos’s eyes are too fierce! Like he owes her $8 million!</p>
<p>What’s more, her sad eyes are just a camouflage that hid a trace of desire from her core! As if he were delicious meal and she couldn’t wait to eat him!</p>
<p>Is it because of her strange gaze that Meng Xinran has been acting jittery all the time?</p>
