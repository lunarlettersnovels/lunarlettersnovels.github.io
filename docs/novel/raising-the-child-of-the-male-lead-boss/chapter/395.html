            <p><strong>Chapter 368</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded her head understandingly. It would be awkward if he was suddenly affectionate with his dad after he’d just been spanked. “It’s okay, baby. We can talk about this in a few days’ time. Let Mommy tell you something. I think you can really learn from your father here. He is a man who can get angry as quickly as he can calm down. Look, when your father does something wrong, he always coaxes Mommy and writes me a self-reflection letter. If Mommy is upset, he writes me those ridiculous essays to cheer me up, even if he doesn’t want to. He is a very versatile man.”</p>
<p>“Right.” Little Bun gave it serious thought as he listened. What his mother said sounded reasonable. “Dad is cheeky. I should learn from that.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blinked in surprise, then stretched out her hands and pinched his soft cheeks. “Your father would smack you again if he heard you say that.”</p>
<p>Little Bun covered his mouth immediately as he looked to the door of the small room. “I’ll only say this to Mommy…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao lowered her head and gave him a kiss on his tiny face. “Sometimes you can best others just by being cheeky! Now, show Mommy your castle! Wow, it looks awesome! How did you make it so spectacularly? The color scheme is very beautiful.”</p>
<p>Little Bun’s chubby cheeks were blushing red from her praise. His unhappiness and depression from earlier had totally disappeared.</p>
<p>And outside the door of the small room, Shen Yichong was standing against the wall listening to the educational conversation between mother and son. He’d come up here to change his clothes and had been attracted by the sound of their talking. A warm smile appeared on his face. He stood listening for a little longer, then he left.</p>
<p>Having a smart and capable wife at home was a man’s greatest blessing. He remembered his father had said this to him, but up until today, he hadn’t fully understood what he’d meant.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stayed with Little Bun and played with him for a while. As she was scrolling on her phone before eating, she suddenly received a text message from Director Zhou Zhuan. The message was to tell her that the movie ‘Chaos’, in which she’d starred, was due to be released soon. The premiere date was set for the beginning of the next month, and the director was hoping she would have time to attend. He also asked her to share the movie trailer on Weibo to help promote it.</p>
<p>This film was a work of absolute sincerity. From the screenwriter to the actors, from the set to the editing, the whole crew had put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhuan had even personally sent text messages to confirm whether the main actors and stresses could attend the premiere. This showed just how much he valued the work.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao instantly agreed to his request.</p>
<p>She liked her role as Sheng Ji, a tragic but beautiful character.</p>
<p>As soon as she got on her Weibo, she found that she was @-ed by countless enthusiastic fans and netizens.</p>
<p>The crew of the film had already released the trailer. Director Zhou Zhuan, Gu Qianqian, and the other main cast members had reposted it. The movie ‘Chaos’ had become the hot topic of the day, and it had aroused enthusiastic discussions among a group of movie fans.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao watched the edited trailer. She discovered that her scenes, from the beginning, middle, and end part of her role were being included in it. In fact, all the clips of her role flashed over the screen in a grand total of less than 10 seconds.</p>
<p>But her fans were all screaming excitedly in the comment section after watching the footage:</p>
<p><em>[She’s so handsome that I’m crying! Gosh, this outfit made my sister look so good! And her gaze while she faces Gu Qianqian in the end… It was absolutely amazing. I’m getting goosebumps!]</em></p>
<p><em>[My Yaoyao’s acting has improved! From the initial girlishness to the mid-stage gorgeousness, and now the final scene of bravery. Gosh!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! My husband’s face fits the big screen so well. Flawless!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Can’t believe my husband is just a supporting role! When are you going to play the leading role? I would definitely blow Box Office up watching that movie!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’m going to the cinema to watch this, just because of this trailer!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Excellent. That’s my idol! I’m bringing my parents to watch this with me. I’m so proud of my YY sister!]</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was so happy after looking at the comments. She immediately reposted the trailer. She also interacted with the director and lead actress, Gu Qianqian, on Weibo.</p>
<p>After Gu Qianqian had helped her, they talked from time to time and had a proper chat once in a while.</p>
<p>Because Yu Yaoyao hadn’t been active for a long while, her repost got a lot of attention from the netizens. Many of her friends in the field came forward to help her promote her new film.</p>
<p><em>[RenSitongV: Husband Yaoyao, I fainted in your cool gaze. I asked my man to get in line tomorrow morning to buy the tickets for the premiere! I’ll definitely come support you! Muacks and good luck on the sales!]</em></p>
<p><em>[WeiMingV: I’m very curious about how you remarked the script? Your gaze proved that this is going to be a great movie. I will call @QiuChengV so we can watch it together.]</em></p>
<p><em>[QiuChengV: @ZhouZhuan, my dude, may I get an invitation to the premiere please?]</em></p>
<p><em>[CaiWenfangV: @YuYaoyao, you have improved again. Amazing!]</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had a lot of close friends, and almost all her fans knew this. No matter what she did, she always ended up gaining a lot of new friends by the end of it.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until today, with her repost, that the fans really discovered her peculiar ability to attract friends.</p>
<p>From her earliest ‘Prosperity’ crew to ‘Stage’, to ‘Wife’ variety show, and then ‘Seven Years’; from photographers to makeup artists, from minor supporting roles to leading actors, almost all of them helped her repost the trailer and were praising her.</p>
<p>All her fans admired her.</p>
<p>Among them, there were fans who were introverted in their lives, there were some that were having a hard time, there were some that didn’t have many friends. But today, they all felt the wave of positive energy that their idol conveyed to them.</p>
<p>Do things seriously and treat others sincerely. Stay enthusiastic about everything, and you will eventually make friends!</p>
<p>They could feel the strong charm that Yu Yaoyao exuded, even through their phones.</p>
<p><em>[I want to learn from Yaoyao husband.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The next time I’m afraid to communicate with people, I’ll come here to see my Yu Yaoyao’s friendly smile.]</em></p>
<p>The comment section quickly changed from a place of praise, to one of learning and growth.</p>
