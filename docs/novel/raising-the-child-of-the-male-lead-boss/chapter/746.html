            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 5 – Must Make Her Beautiful (2)</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt throbbing in his temples and the corners of his mouth twitched.</p>
<p>If the face and voice hadn’t changed, he would have thought that the woman before him had been replaced by an impostor. Whenever she went a little closer to him in the last two years, she dodged and looked flustered.</p>
<p>“Let go!” His face was pitch-black. “As I said last time, don’t even think about money other than the fixed monthly living expenses!”</p>
<p>His voice was so cold that people would think they were in the middle of a blizzard. “You only want to spend my money on other men.” Instantly, the wind and rain outside blew down the branches heavily outside the window.</p>
<p>“I won’t give you five million dollars. Don’t even think of a penny!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was stunned. She remembered now: it seems to have been mentioned in the novel that the male lead found out that the original owner had taken all the money to support the film emperor to shoot, making him extremely angry!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the original owner had been manipulated!</p>
<p>She always thought that the money she took was just for her sister’s tuition fees, investment for her father’s company, and making her family better off. But what she didn’t know was that from the very beginning to end, Yu Xinjie had done this behind her back: fabricating evidence of her infidelity and borrowing her money to approach the film emperor.</p>
<p>Two birds with one stone!</p>
<p>“Put on your clothes!” Shen Yichong took his hand back impatiently. As if touching her felt very dirty.</p>
<p>Finally, he turned and strode away, slamming the door.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao could not help sighing. <i>It’s a difficult start.</i></p>
<p>It was a hell-class difficulty for her to change her husband’s heart.</p>
<p>After the earlier engagement, she almost forgot she had placed her cell phone on the bedside table, of which several messages repeatedly jumped out.</p>
<p><i>— Sister, how are you?</i></p>
<p><i>— Did you see the news? Reply to me…?</i></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao squinted. This was a secret code set by Yu Xinjie and the owner earlier.</p>
<p>When she sends this kind of message, it means a love letter has been released to the public.</p>
<p>But all this was to deceive the original owner, just to test whether she has taken the medicine or not and is still awake. If she doesn’t reply, ten minutes later, this sister will sell her suicide letter to news outlets along with the love letters to be the subject of amusement of netizens.</p>
<p>And then, as soon as she appears in the hospital, she would be surrounded by reporters immediately.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smirked.</p>
<p>She might as well do it!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had gone up the stairway towards his room when soon after he heard gentle footsteps walking behind him keenly.</p>
<p>Turning his head, he saw Yu Yaoyao standing softly near the door.</p>
<p>She was wearing a white silk nightdress and covered it with a knitted, thin, rose-red, long jacket, while her white and tender but somewhat plump feet stepped on a pair of grey, rabbit-eared slippers.</p>
<p>Her hands were tightly wrapped around her jacket, accentuating her slender waist. Her long hair stretched like a long piece of algae. Although her face was pale at the moment, it did not hinder the light in her eyes, which glittered faintly.</p>
<p>“What now?” Shen Yichong glanced at her present appearance and frowned a little.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao could not help but shake off the cold emanating from his body. It was as if she had met a powerful eagle in the wild who could bite her neck from above.</p>
<p>But the next second she bit the tip of her tongue with her teeth, closed her eyes and turned pale. Then she gave a painful whimper and her whole person fell into his bosom!</p>
<p>“Take me to the hospital. Let the reporters… let the reporters photograph me beautifully!”</p>
<p>“Must be… photographed beautifully…!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
