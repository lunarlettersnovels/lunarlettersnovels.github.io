            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 68 – Latching On</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in another room where another contestant was lodging, a girl wearing a mask over her face hurriedly rushed into the room, which was the quarters for the second position artist.</p>
<p>“Brother Dajian, we got down to the third place. What should we do? That fifth black horse…” Halfway through her worrisome speech, she stopped.</p>
<p>There was a handsome boy sprawled on the bed of the room, holding his mobile phone and letting out a ludicrous laugh.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you’d be like this over a pack of fried potato chips!” He laughed and added, “I can’t—little Mei, buy me some cola and that cucumber flavored Lay’s potato chip. I want to test if it really tastes that good!”</p>
<p>The girl: “…Brother Dajian?”</p>
<p>But the boy remained on all fours, lying in the bed, laughing until he was almost convulsing. “Go, go! Buy one quickly, and the third is third! Who cares?” Facing the video once more, he mumbled, “The taste of the breeze. Lol! She’s going to kill me! I’m now a hundred percent convinced why I had lost!”</p>
<p>That whole night was foreordained to be far from tranquil…</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao who had left many people dissatisfied was now happily back at her home. Furthermore, Lay’s has also sent her a contract for a total of 1 million yuan in the first year; If one were to exclude the company’s share and tax, she would probably be left with 300,000 yuan at the very least.</p>
<p>As promised by the company, she was also gifted with a box of potato chips for <em>every</em> flavor.</p>
<p><em>I am truly the best snake reincarnated into a human.</em></p>
<p>She giddily did a victory dance on the spot, outside of their main door. After she was calm, she tried opening the handle only to find out it wouldn’t budge. Letting her grip loosen, the door finally opened to reveal a hard chest as she stood shocked for a moment.</p>
<p>Although she was stunned for a moment, the familiar, spicy smell akin to cinnamon soon rouse her out from her reverie.</p>
<p>Ah, it’s her husband—the great thigh she latches on.</p>
<p>She suddenly closed her eyes and slipped straight into the slender and powerful arms of the man before her, as if she’d suddenly became goo and was boneless for a moment.</p>
<p>She could recall at least a dozen TV dramas where the female protagonists would helplessly crash into the arms of the male protagonists. Although each of them had numerous styles of falling, none of them are definitely as beautiful as her now!</p>
<p>She was wise and naturally knew how to melt into a man’s embrace to stir his desire.</p>
<p>Although her current body is not her original one, for a while she had been lying in the hospital paralyzed and resting. In that span of time, she had felt every muscle and bone in her body as to so better master it.</p>
<p>“Husband~” she drawled out coquettishly.</p>
<p>As played by the female actresses in the TV shows, she tried making her voice as endearing as it could. For several days, she has restrained herself from touching him,</p>
<p>“I’m very tired…I have a migraine incoming, not to mention my waist hurts or is it my back? Lower back pain? My body seems to be weak…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong only stood stiff, stuck in his position as his hand rested on the handle of the door.</p>
<p>Like an octopus, the woman in front of him fell to his chest as soon as she saw him and clung to him tightly as she fell down. But the more she slipped, the more she stuck to his body as if there was a big suction force between them.</p>
<p>His chest felt a little hot from the friction.</p>
<p>And underneath him, he lowered his eyes to swept them towards her delicate face and quivering thick eyelashes. Her small face was as delicate as it has always been, but at this moment, it did look quite fragile—it unexpectedly made him feel a bit of panic.</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who was dragging a suitcase behind, stood awkwardly as a third wheeler he always has been and looked at the couple who locked in an intimate embrace in a mild dilemma.</p>
<p><em>News, rather—gossip on the internet is truly unbelievable, </em>he could only think firmly.</p>
<p>This hug looks tighter and more intimate than that of a lovestruck couple, and even had some hints of ambiguous air…</p>
<p>“Mommy!” A childish voice filled with some worry interrupted the three adults at the door.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked down towards the source of the voice and saw her little steamed bun, his tender and dumpling face a loving sight to see. He had also already dutifully put on his little yellow dinosaur pajamas and held the white snake protectively in his arms. With his short height, he stood in his tiptoes, the chubby hands reaching out to touch his mother’s face with concern.</p>
<p>“Mommy, are you okay?” The steamed bun hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>Only half an hour ago had he been wandering in front of the door, waiting for his mother to come back.</p>
<p>As soon as he heard someone ring the doorbell, he planned to open it standing on his tiptoes, but his father actually beat him to the punch. As soon as he was about to take his mother away from his dad when he looked up, she saw her fall down limply.</p>
<p>The little steamed bun suddenly panicked, his heart refusing to calm down until he hears his mommy speak; this weak appearance of hers made the steamed bun blame himself.</p>
<p>Since he had already seen how frail her mother was in the video, he should have just asked his father to pick up his mom directly. Just like how he picks him up every day from the kindergarten.</p>
<p>Besides, he reminisced to the time he went to nursery for the first time—he was also very uneasy.</p>
<p><em>Now that mommy had just started her first day of work, she must feel scared and tired, right? </em>The small steamed bun anxiously thought, even more fretful to touch his mother’s hand.</p>
<p>It was cool; his mommy’s hand is colder than his!</p>
<p>“Dad, mommy has no strength left. It’s freezing outside. Please bring mommy in quickly!” Shen Rui who ran around a dash towards him, tugged at his dad’s pants, almost dragging it down.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth only twitched at the woman sliding in front of him and towards the back where he felt his pants were about to be pulled down by his son.</p>
