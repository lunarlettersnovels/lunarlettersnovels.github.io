            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 84 – Mommy’s Guardians</strong></p>
<p>The eyes of his father flashed. But the small steamed bun was already gone like a shadow. In front of his dad’s wavering eyes, he rushed to the stairs without even wearing any slippers.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had come back–why, this treatment is completely different from his!</p>
<p>His face was set into a deeper frown as he went out, following after his son, who was resembling more of an excited dog at the moment. As soon as the little steamed bun saw Yu Yaoyao at the door, it was as if he had an invisible little tail waggling happily behind him. He even took the initiative to help her wear her slippers, served her tea and water, and ran around in circles mainly trying to get her needs.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt unable to continue watching this display.</p>
<p>“Wash your hands and get ready for dinner.” He glanced at the steamed bun and turned around.</p>
<p>However, the little steamed bun’s alarmed voice soon rang behind him.</p>
<p>“Mommy, you are hurt!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows creased as he stopped in his tracks. He turned his head back and saw Yu Yaoyao, who was sitting on the sofa beside the small steamed bun, with a conspicuous gauze wrapped around the palm of her right hand.</p>
<p>And the little steamed bun had his heartaches and worry written all over his face. “Mommy, who hurt you?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong walked over, “What’s going on?” and looked at Ni Yi with a stiff face.</p>
<p>Just recently, he had told his son his uncle Ni Yi was there to support his mom so that nothing would happen to her. But then, Yu Yaoyao came home wounded—he ate his words instantly.</p>
<p>Ni Yi sighed, “Today, sister’s props for the performance is a broken mirror. She was holding it her hand a lot of times and accidentally cut herself.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi also wanted to add that in fact, not only did she touch it, but she also threw the mirror to the ground, smashed it, and finally touched the fragments with her bare hands. And that it was only on the way home did he find that her cuffs were covered with small traces of blood.</p>
<p>They hurriedly turned the van around towards the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the wound was not deep, but there were many scratches and lacerations.</p>
<p>“The doctor prescribed a tetanus shot.” Ni Yi quickly confessed, “She can’t touch water for a few days.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun frowned as he listened. He asked, “Mommy, is it painful?” his little, fat face wrinkled.</p>
<p>Last time, when he broke his little nail in his kindergarten, it still felt painful even after smearing it with medicine at night. Looking at the size of his fingers and then at his mother’s palm wrapped in gauze, he was saddened to find that his mother’s wound was so big–it was many times larger than his little finger.</p>
<p><em>Mommy, it must be so painful!</em></p>
<p>The small, steamed bun’s eyes immediately became watery. “Mommy, I’ll help you so that it doesn’t hurt anymore…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao actually felt nothing; this small wound was something she can still endure. But the little steamed bun was very concerned. His small mouth leaned in to blow on her fingertips numb. At this sight, she can’t help but feel warmth blossom inside her heart, as if the original empty place was filled with an incomparable fullness. For the first time, her usually hard and cold-blooded heart felt soft.</p>
<p>When she had been a snake, when was she given such care? Who cared about her when she was hurt?</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was moved and carried the little steamed bun by his butt towards her, proceeding to hug him in her arms.</p>
<p>“My dear baby!”</p>
<p>It turns out this was how exhilarating it felt to have a good and caring baby. Only able to watch TV dramas, read novels and watch tourists come and go inside the zoo—she could not understand the feelings between mother and child.</p>
<p>But now…she seems to finally understand. What is more important than being related by blood is the warmth that comes from the embrace of two people who care for each other deeply.</p>
<p>When the little steamed bun was tightly hugged by his mother, he froze for a moment. Soon after, he tried to stretch out his small arm to pat her on the back.</p>
<p>“Mommy, don’t be afraid. I’ll hold you until you’re not afraid anymore. Dad and I will protect you all the time. When I grow up, I will give you a lot of pocket money, so mommy doesn’t have to work hard every time.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sniffed and nodded seriously. Her beautiful, little face softened as she said, “Okay. Mommy is waiting for the baby to grow up.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shen Yichong’s mouth was twitching. He could only see this woman’s acting is becoming more and more realistic by the day!</p>
<p>“Dad, dad! You come here quickly!”</p>
<p>After the small steamed bun was held for some time, he painstakingly withdrew his small hands with difficulty from his mommy and waved at the spectator, Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows and approached them in a few steps.</p>
<p>The little steamed bun quickly grabbed one corner of his shirt. “Mommy can’t touch water with her hands today. Dad, you have to help mom take a bath!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “…!”</p>
