            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 215 – Reclaiming What Was Lost (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Sis, what are you talking about? The present I give has a different meaning than yours.” Yu Xinjie rebutted, but Yu Yaoyao ignored what she said, just went straight ahead and sat down on her chair.</p>
<p>Then she smiled at the cameraman, Mr. Zheng.</p>
<p>“Come, my dear sister, come look at the notes I’ve had.” she invited, Zheng got the hint and immediately turned the camera to the notebook for a close-up, equally curious.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie frowned, walked over, eyeing Yu Yaoyao suspiciously, and finally took a look.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao patted the empty chair next to her generously.</p>
<p>“Come sit here, Sis.”</p>
<p>“I just calculated, you owe me over 22.2 million,” she stated rather gleefully. Yu Xinjie stared at her, completely flabbergasted!</p>
<p>“Nonsense! No, how….”</p>
<p>This time, it was Yu Yaoyao that pulled on her arm and did not let her go.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, look, I’ve got all noted,” she hummed and pointed down at her notes, “Last spring, you took 6 million, said that your mom opened a beauty salon and you needed to support her career.”</p>
<p>She proceeded with the next item on the list…</p>
<p>“The winter before, you took 2 million, said that you are studying abroad, working hard on your project, and traveling around, so you need to borrow some money from me… and 1 million….”</p>
<p>And she went on, and on, and on…</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” Yu Xinjie wanted to stand up, “Sis, you gave it to me will—”</p>
<p><em><strong>Willingly….</strong></em></p>
<p>She wanted to say so but chickened out when she saw the camera.</p>
<p>If she said it, that means she admitted taking the money of her married sister!</p>
<p>Even fools knew Yu Yaoyao was just a small star before her marriage.</p>
<p>Their household didn’t have such big money for this elder daughter. Yu Yaoyao has only been a wealthy housewife for the past five years, without any source of income.</p>
<p>Once this would be broadcasted to the public, everyone would know she was trying to glue herself to her sister and leech out her brother-in-law’s money!</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie clammed her mouth shut, eyes filled with rage, but tried to make a calm look, even put a joking smile.</p>
<p>“Sis, you can’t just joke around like this….”</p>
<p>She could almost feel the twitch on her mouth. When did Yu Yaoyao find the time to keep all the records? And so sneakily at that!?</p>
<p>Was she just playing dumb after all this time then?!</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie quickly glanced at Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao asked him for a lot of money before, and those were indeed used for her mom’s salon, along with her study abroad, and maybe even a few property purchases. But what happened with the money afterward was that she did many things, and invested the money in Chen Qiao.</p>
<p>With Shen Yichong’s ability, he must have known that Yu Yaoyao took his properties and invested in Chen Qiao.</p>
<p>He should understand that she was not saying the ‘truth’ in front of the camera, it was to protect Yu Yaoyao and his dignity, shouldn’t he?</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie looked at Shen Yichong hoping for help, “Yichong, look at Sis, do something……” she pleaded softly.</p>
<p>If he still had any sense, he should know that, keep saying before the camera would only expose the truth that his wife was unfaithful, and cause harm to both him and the kid.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Shen Yichong didn’t even give her a look.</p>
<p>Instead, he raised his hand, took the napkin, and wiped out the sauce at Yu Yaoyao’s mouth, “Why are you like a child?” he asked her, with such tenderness and attention in his eyes, the softness of his tone…w</p>
<p>It hadn’t been there before.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie gritted her teeth, what was going on?!</p>
<p>“Yichong……”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong finally raised his head, but the coldness and impatience in his eyes stabbed Yu Xinjie like a sharp knife, startling her unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“These things are between you two, but your sister won’t lie about this.” he defended. And at that Yu Xinjie was rendered speechless.</p>
<p>What did that mean?</p>
<p>Now, this couple had made up their mind to ask her to pay back the money in front of the camera? Shen Yichong’s company had no money after all!?</p>
<p>Did that mean he was going to get all the money he gave to her family back?!</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie’s face turned pale but soon became ruddy again. They had never signed any contract before, if they wanted to get it back, it wouldn’t be easy. She won’t make it easy!</p>
<p>Those were all gifts!</p>
<p>So they recorded it in the notebook, so what? What could they do with her?</p>
<p>Even if they broke the relationship, they can’t even sue to the court!</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie soon calmed herself down, “Sis, I don’t even know about this notebook, I’ll go ask Mom. There must be a misunderstanding, Sis.”</p>
<p>She took a glance at the camera, and her heart suddenly pounded, but soon she showed a malicious smile.</p>
<p>Would the show broadcast this part?</p>
