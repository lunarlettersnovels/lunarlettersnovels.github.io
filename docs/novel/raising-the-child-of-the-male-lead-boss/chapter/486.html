            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 277 – Only Woman (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>As Ni Yi handed her the phone, he relayed to her the questions the director had asked. He wanted to urge Yu Yaoyao to prepare herself mentally or even a simple draft before she called him. Of course, Ni Yi had told Director Qi Hang about the live stream, so he knew that the contents of his call would be exposed to the public.</p>
<p>“Director Qi said that he doesn’t really mind the livestream,” Ni Yi told her, “but if it is going to affect your performance, he is most willing to oblige and have a talk with the director of the show to offer you some privacy from the audience. You can call him again in ten minutes. He said he is free all morning today.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, still holding Shen Yichong’s hand and trying to shade her face from the sun with her other one, said, “I am fine with it. I will do it now. Besides, we still need to help the other two families later.”</p>
<p>She was still thinking about that! Ni Yi and the staff felt nervous at her response. She rang the caller ID that was visible on the phone. “Director Qi Hang?” she asked, “Hello, it’s me Yu Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>As she was talking on the phone, Shen Rui stopped collecting the shells and dug for a water bottle and handed it to Yu Yaoyao silently. Shen Yichong asked the staff for a parasol and a chair for her to take the call comfortably.</p>
<p>The livestream comment section was active, with many applauding Shen Yichong and expressing their jealousy:</p>
<p><strong>[I, the salt of the Earth, am here again!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[No no no, could Mr. Shen be sweeter than this? Could the baby be a bigger sweetheart? I’m really jealous!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[My sis’s being treated in a way Royals are, no less than what she deserves….]</strong></p>
<p>The call and conversation of Yu Yaoyao and Director Qi Hang was heard by all. His voice sounded like a middle-aged man’s, full of gentleness, understanding and warmth. It was easy to like him from the way he talked, specifically because he sounded so soothing that relaxed anyone who heard him speak.</p>
<p>“Yu, I won’t waste time with formalities for now,” he said, “Old Li recommended you to me. I have seen your performance in <em>In the Limelight</em> and some other clips that Old Li gave me. Your acting skills are very good, and I find you most apt to play the second female lead, Lin You. But I have always believed that painting skin and bones can do only so much. Most times, a character can be played only when the actor’s experiences are similar to the character that one plays to understand the psychology of the character deeply.” He paused. “It just so happens that you are a mother and a wife. So, I want to listen to you and your views on marriage and love. Please speak casually, as you would do with a good friend.”</p>
<p>Director Qi Hang was different from Li Bo and Zhou Qiu. He believed in a softer approach in conversing with the actors and actresses working with him, while the other directors took a stricter approach. Director Qi Hang paid more attention to the similarities in aptitude between the characters and the actors playing them, so that what comes on screen could be more realistic and authentic.</p>
<p>The Director’s gentle, paternal tone encouraged Yu Yaoyao to speak frankly. “Yes, Uncle Director,” she said, unable not to form a bond between them. He just seemed so affectionately paternal. “I think love is the easy part.” She paused.</p>
<p>“Tell me more,” said the director.</p>
<p>“I originally thought love would be a tough commitment to keep,” she said, “I had thought that love would be stressful and vigorous, and a lot of tears, but now it seems like it’s not that at all, it’s easy, something that could happen in a moment. It could show itself in small things. Maybe you forgot to eat, and he gives you a bite of his food. Or maybe you are tired, and he offers you a coffee. Maybe you forget toilet papers when you go to the toilet, and he doesn’t mind handing it to you. It’s in the smallest, most absurd things.”</p>
<p>The Director listened silently. But the viewers in the livestream couldn’t help but be mirthful on Yu Yaoyao’s comment about the toilet paper:</p>
<p><strong>[My Mr. Shen has another name. In addition to being a wife-feeding boss, I can also call him the toilet paper specialist in the future!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Someone necessary for vacation! ]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[My sis is really awesome! Mr. Shen is the Empress’ Manager at home, right?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Y, no wonder she had to find Mr. Shen! He’s… easy to use!]</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao waited for a response from the Director, but none came. “Uncle Director?” she inquired into the phone, “Are you still there?”</p>
<p>The comment section was uproarious at this:</p>
<p><strong>[Pfttt ha ha ha, the director probably fainted!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Director: Where am I?! Is it the year 9012 here? Why is there no one in my love life to dress me and to feed me?!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Director: I was wrong, what family ethics film am I trying to make?! I don’t understand love at all!]</strong></p>
<p>Director Qi Hang’s voice rang out after a while. There was a sound of a cup being placed on a table loudly from the other side of the line. “I just entered the live broadcast of your variety show,” he said, “There are so many viewers.” The viewers tried their best to diffuse the insult they had thrown at him by posting greetings for the Director or apologizing for their words.</p>
<p>Director Qi Hang cleared his throat and spoke again. “So, Yu, what about your thoughts on marriage?” he asked, “The role is of a woman who is a loser trapped in a loveless marriage and her husband is cheating on her—.”</p>
<p>“Why is she branded a loser just because her husband is cheating on her?” interrupted Yu Yaoyao.</p>
