<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 312 – One Take (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>In the dressing room, Yu Yaoyao’s assistant, Little Shuang, took advantage of the makeup break and brought her a juice bottle, “Sister Yu, have a sip of pear juice to moisturize your throat. There will be more talking needed in the next scene,” she put a straw in it and let Yu Yaoyao suck the fruit juice so her lipstick wouldn’t smudge.</p>
<p>The two makeup artists who were working on Yu Yaoyao’s hair and makeup, couldn’t help but laugh. They made a joke after glancing at the almost fully piled table next to them. “How lucky are you, Mrs. Yu. Just the number of drinks that your husband has already sent is overwhelming. He even labelled them individually! At first, we thought it was Little Shuang who did it, we only found out it was your husband after asking her,” one of them said.</p>
<p>Assistant Little Shuang nodded enviously, “Yeah, the boss is definitely a perfect husband. He even personally reminded me of when to make you eat and when to drink before we headed out…”</p>
<p>Holding the script, Yu Yaoyao couldn’t help but smile, “He is just looking down on my IQ. He feels that I don’t remember efficiently.”</p>
<p>“Everyone on the internet knows that Mr. Shen dotes on his wife.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Yu, may I take a picture? I…” the hairstylist couldn’t resist the urge to photograph the huge pile of water bottles, thermos and lunch boxes on the table. But it was polite to ask first, even if she was feeling a little embarrassed that she wanted to take the picture to share and gossip with her friends.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao and her husband had always shown their affection towards each other on numerous occasions, but because of her earlier reputation, there had always been some that questioned the relationship between the two, especially after the scandal concerning her blood-sucking mother was exposed. It made some feel that Shen Yichong really loved her, or that their marriage was fake. A man could never allow his wife’s family to take so much money from him… Unless he was very rich and very dumb.</p>
<p>But the outsiders didn’t know the truth, they were merely curious.</p>
<p>The makeup artist also just wanted to share the latest internal news with her friends, but she didn’t dare say so. She felt sorry for Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” Yu Yaoyao waved her hand casually, “Post on wherever you want. It doesn’t matter to me.”</p>
<p><em><strong>This chapter was brought to you by Lunar Letters. Please read at the original site.</strong></em></p>
<p>Showing off her husband’s affection for her? How could she do something so embarrassing? Little Sisi had also mentioned that a wife should praise her husband occasionally, but not too much. The praise should focus on encouragement, otherwise, the man would easily become too proud.</p>
<p>If someone else was posting the picture for her, it would be perfect!</p>
<p>“Thank you so much, Mrs. Yu! You really are so down to earth!” the hairstylist was surprised to hear her response. Those who work in the industry seldom get permission from the artists to reveal such privacy to their friends.</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it. Oh! By the way, are you hungry? Little Shuang, bring out my little cakes and share them with everyone, and also the small puddings and milk. Bring all the flavors so everyone can choose,” it was only after Yu Yaoyao had had a best friend that she had learned more about sharing. “I guess this scene will take a long time, and you will all be hungry,” as she said this, her expression turned bitter.</p>
<p>Her husband had been right. Director Qi Hang was a huge fan of NGs.</p>
<p>In the previous scene, she had been with Cai Fang, the star who played as the mistress. They had NG 13 times, just because Cai Fang’s expression had not been angry and aggrieved enough after she’d been roasted by Yu Yaoyao. Then, she’d had another four NGs because of the speed at which she was eating while scolding Cai Fang, and then how fast she was picking up dishes!</p>
<p>“Mrs. Yu, the number of NGs you got isn’t terrible,” the makeup artist sighed. “Do you know, just for the pacing of the scene where the female lead was buying a pair of shoes… We had 35 NGs! Can you believe it?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded sorrowfully.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she’d listened to her husband’s advice and read the theory book about moving positions and lenses in advance. She had learned the basics of a few long and short shots and dynamic shooting. Otherwise, she would have been the one to experience the 35 NGs.</p>
<p>“The director said the scene you are shooting later is going to be difficult. Sis, drink more pear juice. I’ll get you another milk bottle, and I’ll be waiting for you on-set. While you get your makeup touched up during the NGs, you can rest and recharge your energy levels,” Assistant Little Shuang said worriedly.</p>
<p>The makeup artist also became serious when she heard about it, “If Director Qi said it is difficult, there has to be more than 30 NGs, given that no one has the record of passing a difficult scene under that amount. I’ll bring all the brushes later and use them during touch-up,” the makeup was going to be a mess after taking a shot 30 times!</p>
<p>The entire crew, except Qi Hang himself, was terrified of NGs.</p>
<p>From male lead to male supporting actors, and from female lead to female supporting actors, almost every shot had to be taken more than a dozen times.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had been emotionally unstable for the past few days, but she had been taken care of by Qi Hang. Her shots were all concentrated on crying scenes, and she had the least NGs.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao and the others arrived on-set after putting on their makeup, Director Qi Hang was waiting, “Okay, let’s get started once you’re ready!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was dressed in a formal interview outfit; a black blazer accompanied by a white shirt and flattering formal skirt. According to her role in the film, she was a woman who had been a full-time homemaker for seven years after getting married. Her age in the play was 35 years old. Her usually delicate face was darkened by foundation by the makeup artist. Some obvious wrinkles on her forehead and her eyes had also been drawn. The makeup also helped to dull her spirit. In this way, her image was in line with the image of a woman who was once beautiful, but whose beauty had gradually faded, making her husband tire of her and leading to an affair.</p></div>
