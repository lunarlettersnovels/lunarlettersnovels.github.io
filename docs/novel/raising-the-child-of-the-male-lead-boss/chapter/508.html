            <p><strong>Chapter 255 – Cologne (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded. She took a pack of fruit juice and some mint-flavored fudge from her bag. She gave one to Little Bun and put another into her mouth. The mint tingled her senses and refreshed her. Suddenly, she lifted her head and looked around both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>“Mommy, what’s wrong?” asked Shen Rui.</p>
<p>“I thought I smelled your father’s cologne,” she said still looking around everywhere. She stood up, with her hands on the seat in front of her and craned her neck to look around more. Mr. Zheng was still filming before the take-off. Her fans on the internet, who were closely following every new segment, were thrilled. They wished they could run to her and tell her. But from beyond the screen, all they could do was drop words of encouragement and hope she would see it later:</p>
<p><strong>【That’s right! Your husband is five rows ahead to the left of you! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Look up! Get him! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【I cried, is this love? Ow! I want to fall in love too! 】</strong></p>
<p>Director Zhao, who was sitting beside Shen Yichong, was stunned. He had disguised him so thoroughly that not even his mother would have been able to recognize him. Shen Yichong’s eyes twinkled behind his fake glasses as he heard his wife. It made him feel warm with love. He couldn’t help but turn around, but Director Zhao stopped him. “Don’t move. Don’t turn around!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was now out of her seat and had taken two steps forward, probably trying to follow the smell of the cologne. “Honey…,” she called out. Her eyes were filled with confusion. She called again, but there was no response. She looked around, but there wasn’t any familiar figure. Eventually, the stewardess came over and suggested that she take a seat for take-off.</p>
<p>The viewers were filled with frustration seeing them so close and yet…. This had turned into a sensational love story and the two of them seemingly so close but unable to meet filled the fans with a feeling of tragic loss.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, meanwhile, also felt the loss. She had been absolutely sure that Shen Yichong was on the plane. “Mommy, is daddy really here?” asked Little Bun. Yu Yaoyao sighed.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said, “I felt like he was right here. I thought I smelled his cologne that he loves to wear.”</p>
<p>“Did you see him when you stood up?” asked Little Bun.</p>
<p>“No,” she sighed.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was disappointed, but Little Bun seemed even more frustrated. She tapped him on his shoulder. “It’s alright, baby. We will be alright. We have only around 380 Yuan left for now. If your father was here, it would be difficult to manage with such a low amount. Let him be with Director Zhao for now.” She said this so that Little Bun would miss his father less. But it was also true. They had spent a lot of that money buying snacks at the airport, which had been twice as expensive than usual.</p>
<p>Little Bun nodded solemnly. “Mommy, maybe you smelled a different cologne and thought it was dad’s.” He chewed on his mint-flavored fudge thoughtfully, “Maybe it was this mint that you confused with the cologne.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded. It did make sense. “Yes, or maybe the staff who took his card is on the plane, and that’s why the smell is familiar.”</p>
<p>The solemn and tragic atmosphere that had dominated the live broadcast with Yu Yaoyao’s plight reverted to humor as she said this. Yu Yaoyao always said funny things that didn’t allow the despair to last.</p>
<p>The plane, finally, took off. The flight was provided with Wi-Fi, which meant that the show could continue broadcasting live as long as the connection remained stable. Director Zhao Yu was glad. However, his spirits were soon dampened, and he stopped grinning. “Mr. Shen, what are you doing?” he asked, incredulously.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had stood up. “I need to go to the washroom,” he said. If he did, he would have to walk along the aisle and pass Yu Yaoyao!</p>

<p><em>Thank you for your patience! Here we have a desperate Shen Yichong~</em></p>
