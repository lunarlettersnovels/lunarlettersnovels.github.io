            <p><strong>Chapter 497</strong></p>
<p>After the summer season, the total box office of ‘Killer’ reached 3 billion, which directly refreshed the box office record of this year’s literary films!</p>
<p>The fans were all saying that Yaoyao must be nominated for the Golden Rooster Award for Best Actress this time. The Golden Rooster Award was the most authoritative and professional film award in mainland China. If she were to win this award, it would mean that her status as the best actress wouldn’t be questioned.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Golden Rooster Awards were not held every year. It was only held once every two years. They could only have their fingers crossed and look forward to next year’s bumper harvest. However, the expectations of the fans did not add any burden to Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>She had already started working on her new script ‘30 Days of Madness’. Director Li revised the script and storyboard many times, which also gave Yu Yaoyao time to constantly polish her role. From the first confirmation of the role at the end of July till the actual filming took half a year, and Yu Yaoyao had been shutting herself from the world aside from appearing on variety shows.</p>
<p>It was not until the end of the year that Director Li officially started the filming and assembled the group. Due to the filming location, Yu Yaoyao needed to stay abroad for the first time. And this time, Shen Yichong had to take care of Little Sweetheart at home, and couldn’t accompany her to the crew in person. The couple separated for the first time in three years.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Little Bun was in elementary school and was about to go on winter vacation. He had finished his homework in advance and applied to Shen Yichong to follow his Mommy to the crew. Little Bun was obviously reluctant to leave his lovely little sister, and he was still full of bitterness on the day he left home. But compared to that, he couldn’t let Mommy leave alone.</p>
<p>As a man who was learning taekwondo and one of the only men in the family, he must protect the girls in the family. Daddy will be with Little Sweetheart, taking care of her daily. Then he would be responsible for following Mommy.</p>
<p>Little Sweetheart had long been weaned, and she could even speak simple vocabulary. Yu Yaoyao couldn’t help but cry as she got into the nanny car with Little Bun.</p>
<p>“Mommy… fly, umm, sweetheart!” Little Sweetheart was at the age where she could mutter.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao understood her childish and incoherent words at once. <em>‘Mommy is taking a plane, and she should bring Little Sweetheart with her.’</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t feel that much emotion at first, but leaving home for 14 days this time was also a first experience for her. She was worried most about leaving Little sweetheart behind. She couldn’t bear it at all.  Although Little Sweetheart was snug in Shen Yichong’s arms, her two small arms were stretched out towards her, and her body in a small dress was leaning forwards. Her tears fell immediately.</p>
<p>“Little Sweetheart, Mommy can’t take you with me. Can you accompany Daddy at home?” she softly said.</p>
<p>“Daddy, fly!” Little sweetheart started, “Brother, fly!”</p>
<p>Little Sweetheart turned around, resolutely looking at Shen Yichong and Shen Rui. She obviously already knew the concept of family. Although she was young, she firmly insisted that no one in the family could be gone. Everyone had to go on a plane together.</p>
<p>“Darling, I don’t want to go anymore… I’d also like to accompany Little Sweetheart. Can she not accompany me to the crew?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao burst into tears immediately. Little Shen Rui’s eyes were also a little red. But he has grown up, and he knew that his father’s persistence was right.</p>
<p>“Mommy, Little Sweetheart is still a baby,” he began instead of his father, “she just learned how to walk. It’s too dangerous to bring her to the set. Besides, she has to be vaccinated again this weekend.”</p>
<p>After one year of elementary school, he had grown a little taller. He carried his small suitcase and grabbed Yu Yaoyao’s hand.</p>
<p>“Mummy, we should go…” he said with difficulty. He glanced back at Little Sweetheart who pouted her mouth helplessly, tears gathering in her eyes, and he turned his head resolutely. “Little Sweetheart, listen to Daddy. Mommy and I will be back soon,” he said with finality. Shen Rui then turned his head and wiped his tears.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who had been crying for a long time, was also hugged by Shen Yichong. He soothed her back, which was trembling from sobbing.</p>
<p>“This is normal,” he said consolingly. “When I go on a business trip in the future , I will also rely on you to take care of the children at home… alone. Little Sweetheart will adapt to this.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded. Finally, she was dragged into the car by Shen Rui and her assistant. When the door was closed, Little Sweetheart outside finally couldn’t hold back and burst into tears.  Yu Yaoyao in the car also hugged Shen Rui, and the two of them cried together out loud.</p>
<p>Ni Yi could only comfort them from the front seats. “Let’s finish the filming ASAP. Without any NG, we could definitely complete the filming within two weeks. By then, we could come home to Little Sweetheart again.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Mommy! We’ll be fine. I’ve brought my tablet. Every day when you finish work early, we can video call with Little Sweetheart,” he offered enthusiastically.  “Just like when we were still at home, Mommy. When you went to the game, you also did a video call with me. Do you remember?”</p>
<p>Little Shen Rui patted Yu Yaoyao on her shoulder and handed her a tissue before taking another for himself.</p>
<p>“Okay, right… video call. And we finish this quickly.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao made the decision with red eyes.</p>
