            <p><strong>Chapter 238 – Suffering An Injustice (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Livyuna</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Proofreader: Livyuna</em></p>
<p>On that screen, Yu Yaoyao walked ever so lightly, eventually jumping closer to the center, right at the heart of the camera. Her striped, blue and white skirt drifted gently behind like a loose cloud, although wrinkled. Adding to that, was the frizz of her curly ponytail. Everything about Yu Yaoyao at the moment screamed childlike.</p>
<p>A hair or two fell from one ear, mischievously landing beside the delicate white, and swan-like neck mounting her face. She bit her lip slightly, a gesture oozing of natural purity, and reached out to tuck the loose strand behind her ear.</p>
<p>After which, she spared a glance at the camera, the unexpectedly surprising. There seemed to be a twinkle of mist in her eyes. Yu Yaoyao then proceeded to lower her head, pulling out the silver chain clasping her neckline shortly after.</p>
<p>The small diamonds attached to it almost duplicate that of sand grains; minuscule unless separated and thoroughly examined. But still it bloomed in a dazzling spark, blinding like the burning power of a thousand suns, all while resting on her slim collarbones.</p>
<p>In an instant, Yu Yaoyao’s whole demeanor changed! As if she were a porcelain doll, carved from the chastity of pink jade, subsequently infused with a vibrant soul.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao reached out to twirl a broken diamond with her delicate fingertips. From the reflection emerged a radiant sparkle, a potential foe to that of fireworks. Finally, she turned her head slightly, all pursed her lips to a cherubic smile, as if delicate flowers have begun to bloom atop her face. In those eyes, were hints of vivid colors, the shimmer as strong as ocean currents on a thunderous night.</p>
<p>JIa Zijie, who had been staring at the monitor throughout the whole time, rubbed his own in disbelief. It was a blinding welcome; he felt like an infant seeing light for the first time. Contrastingly, Director Ji Chang frowned beside him without saying a word — up until an unknown sound startled his senses, forcing his entirety awake. The iron frame had been hit rather loudly.</p>
<p>“Cut!” Ji Chang blurted out.</p>
<p>After the command however, he offered a glimpse at Jia Zijie. Jia Zijie, who had just come out of the trance, regaining his own control, turned to look at him as well. They both stared at each other for a while.</p>
<p>And just by the congregation of their gazes, both instantly remembered their original purpose in the other party’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, do it again!” Ji Chang yelled without a backwards thought. “It just didn’t work.”</p>
<p>Before long, the sound of thick, saturating anger pulsated all over the studio, succeeding to profuse every crew member in the area.</p>
<p>“You are powerless! Definitely not in line with the image of youth, do it again!”</p>
<p>“Go slow! You are moving too fast. Again!”</p>
<p>“Your eyes are too strong, give me innocence and purity. Start all over again!”</p>
<p>“No, no, no! Again!”</p>
<p>To the side, Ni Yi sat with clenched teeth, beyond furious with what’s happening in front of him. Like the last time, he wanted to grapple and jerk Ji Chang’s head. Not much has changed. Yu Yaoyao in front of the camera, persevered on, over and over again without halt to the brutal routine.</p>
<p>He could see an improvement with every performance. From the onset of the first cut to her 20th <em>‘Not Good</em>’, her eyes shined even brighter than the last time! However —</p>
<p>“Stop!” Director Ji grasped a handful of his own hair, impatient and frustration all sticking to his aura. “I’m not shooting anymore! This was a waste of my time! It’s not what I want!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi took a hard breath, it’s all he can do to retain every last bit of composure that remained within him.</p>
<p>Kia Zijie proceeded to step forward.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but we have been shooting for more than five hours now, taking into consideration your lack of punctuality, plus slow makeup time. No matter the terms of professionalism, you have not shown any ability to fulfill the agreement and demands required for the film and our product.” He pauses, only to look intensely at her. “We have decided to unilaterally propose a reasonable termination of the contract, and you need to pay for the loss of the publicity work we have carried out so far.”</p>
<p>As soon as the words hit Yu Yaoyao, she immediately pulled away from the camera, a questioning look on her face replaced the act of purity she thought had finally bore fruit. By the next second, she closed her mouth in a hum. Her eyes trembled, as if tears were about to burst. “Let me try again! Please?”</p>
<p>“It’s been ‘try again’ for more than a dozen times!” Jia Zijie turned his back. “Get out of my sight! If you stumble upon any problems in the future, find the legal affairs of our company. We will not hesitate to suspend this endorsement and hold you accountable.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s body shook in distress. Ni Yi hastily ran over to her side.</p>
<p>“Well then, I’ll go.” She gazed back over her shoulder with every step. But it was a pity no one in the studio paid an ounce of attention to her.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, Ni Yi accompanied her out of the venue.</p>
<p>By three o’clock in the afternoon, the sun was not as high and bright like before, but it still shone directly on Yu Yaoyao’s face, incandescent and warm, melting away all traces of sorrow.</p>
<p>Ni Yi stretched his hand out to squeeze plump, fleshy cheeks. He was still so angry, wanting nothing more than to beat those tyrants to the point of asphyxiation.</p>
<p>“Sister, I filmed it all!” He boomed with immense excitement. “I photographed them, right at the back of their hideous heads, and your excellent performance! You’re right, but we still have to cancel the contract, we can’t terminate it in vain!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately reached out to cover her coy grin secretly.</p>
