<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 127 – A Stolen Kiss</strong></p>
<p>The little bun quickly turned his head and saw that the small sofa in the room was some distance from his bed. It was at least twice the length of his father separating him from his mommy!</p>
<p><em>It’s too far! </em>the bun miserably complained. His lips pressed into a thin line as he dashed towards the small sofa. Upon reaching it, he bent down and pursed his little buttocks. With a determined heave, he pushed the edge of the sofa with his tiny hands, trying to move it forward.</p>
<p>Although it was a small in stature, it was designed for a single adult. Moreover, there were no rollers under the sofa.</p>
<p>The little bun’s face turned red as he mustered all the remaining energy from the milk he drank. With a desperate pout, he was only able to push it a meter away.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stretched out a hand and held down the sofa mercilessly.</p>
<p>In an instant, even if the little guy used his head to move it, the sofa wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>The little bun immediately cried, “Dad!”</p>
<p>“You can only be some distance away.” Shen Yichong replied with a firm look; he was not to question him. “Listen to your mother. You can’t be sick, so keep a distance from her.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui looked up at his father angrily. How?! The sofa was still far away from even the tip of his mother’s bed! His mummy wouldn’t be able to see him unless she looked up!</p>
<p>“Baby be obedient. It will hurt when you are sick.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao uttered the words from the bottom of her heart to urge the little bun as she glanced fearfully at the needle inserted in her hand.  Shen Rui, the little bun finally agreed, although with a bit of reluctance. His head down, he obediently sat down on the small sofa.</p>
<p>His mother was currently a patient. He can’t be capricious, and most of all, his mother must have endured discomfort only to please him. Perhaps he should tell her some interesting stories in return that her pain would lessen even by a bit.</p>
<p>With such a thought, little bun searched his little brain hard for something interesting and eagerly told his mother all the stories he recently heard from his teachers and friends.</p>
<p>When he saw her mother’s face contort from the bitter medicine she drank, as if she were in pain, he immediately sprang from his position. Wiggling his bottom, he climbed down from the sofa and searched for a sweet candy inside his small backpack. A treat he carried from his kindergarten.</p>
<p>After looking bitterly at his father, he reluctantly handed the candy to him. “If you give it to mommy, her mouth won’t taste bitter anymore.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao suffered from the revolting taste of traditional medicine and felt her tears were at bay. When she heard the little bun, only then did a bright smile grace her face.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Shen Yichong felt as if he had two children. Having a son was already a difficult feat, to add another daughter like Yu Yaoyao would be akin to courting death.</p>
<p>Upon delivering the candy, she gleefully opened her mouth, looking at him expectantly. “Ah~” she cooed, like a baby bird in a nest waiting to be fed, its eyes still closed… A bald baby bird with its black eyes, sparkling like jewels, waited on him.</p>
<p>His chest shook instantly. His slender fingers took a long time to open the wrapping as his eyes dropped low. Upon extracting the treat, he directly plopped it into her dainty mouth.</p>
<p>“Laziness will be the death of you.”</p>
<p>After he uttered such statement, when he was about to withdraw his hand, Yu Yaoyao instantly took a bite of his forefinger that held the candy to her.</p>
<p>He released a muffled groan as a trickle of an electric current flowed from his bit forefinger. It travelled from Yu Yaoyao’s teeth… all the way to the blood vessels of his body and rushed straight to his head!</p>
<p>The culprit looked at him with trembling eyes, feeling miserable. “Don’t be mean to me. I’m still not feeling well.”</p>
<p>“Yes, dad! don’t bully the sick mommy!” The little bun climbed atop his sofa to shout his protest.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong narrowed his eyes at his bitten finger, which was currently throbbing. He truly felt that this woman ought to be scolded! That and his blind son who can’t determine right from wrong!</p>
<p>With a clipped tone he instructed, “Shen Rui, go wash your hands and eat with your uncle Lin. Your mother is going to rest.”</p>
<p>The little bun’s eyebrows deeply creased as he looked towards his stern father. He did not want to leave, but then he saw Yu Yaoyao’s tired face. And as if on cue, his stomach grumbled, signaling his hungriness.</p>
<p>“Okay…” He reluctantly agreed. But then he added, “When I’m full, I’ll teach you dad how to feed my mommy!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong waited for Yu Yaoyao’s supporting, little tail drag his feet across the floor heavily. The moment the little bun was finally out of the room, his gaze shifted to the sick and still restless Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>His face was heavy. She bit his finger blatantly, a habit she might have picked up from the questionable movies she watched at home. In another two years, his son will be older and can easily pick up wrong behaviors.</p>
<p>“Some things can’t be done in front of the child. Such matter should be kept between us—” he chided with a stern, cold face.</p>
<p>But halfway to his speech, he felt his neck constrict.</p>
<p>His necktie was viciously grasped by Yu Yaoyao’s small hand. As he was relentlessly pulled into the bed, his head dipped down meeting Yu Yaoyao’s raised face towards him. Her plucked lips immediately made contact with his cold ones.</p>
<p>A rich, milky fragrance from something pink and tender, gently wafted from her mouth and deftly made its way deeper into his mouth… he tasted sweetness that eroded his nerves and disintegrated all his rational thoughts.</p>
<p>His usually calm brain crashed on the spot.</p>
<p>“Boss, it’s not good!”</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em> The little bun stealthily returned after the door was knocked open by a panicked Ni Yi.</p>
