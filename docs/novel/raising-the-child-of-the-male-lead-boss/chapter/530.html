<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 232 – Treatment of A Rival Company (2)</strong></p>
<p>He leaned over and took a look at the assistant’s phone, then gasped. At first glance, this Ling Shuang looked like the same type of actress as Yu Yaoyao: outstanding appearance, with a hint of seduction in the eyes. They were both natural beauties. Only, the Ling Shuang in this photo was shot on the campus, and she looked more like a cold beauty.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao already saw this photo, but she was feeling indifferent at that moment so she did not give a reaction. For sure she wouldn’t lose to this girl so easily!</p>
<p>“No worries, Yiyi, this girl hasn’t grown enough hair yet.” She waved her hand dismissively, “She won’t be better than me even after 20 years!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi covered his nose, “Okay.”</p>
<p>After thinking, he turned to speak to Yu Yaoyao, “Sis, that idiom… is usually used to describe young boys, saying that they’re immature. It’s not a very suitable thing to say to describe a girl.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted. She didn’t want a language class from Ni Yi.</p>
<p>Soon enough, they arrived at the studio where the <em>Excellent Diamond</em> commercial would be shot today. After the final competition, she signed the contract for this commercial.</p>
<p>Excellent Diamond was a subsidiary company of the<em> Crocker Diamond Family Group </em>who were known for their diamonds. Excellent Diamond was a business venture undertaken by them to offer their products to the general public and make it more accessible to the masses, unlike that of their main brand whose market was niche.</p>
<p>They arrived 30 minutes earlier than the agreed time.</p>
<p>However, the atmosphere in the studio was strange. Not even one staff greeted them when they arrived. Even the head of the advertisement, Jia Zijie, was standing in front of the camera and kept talking to the director, but didn’t look like he would greet and welcome them at all! This situation made Ni Yi frown.</p>
<p>Right after the competition, Jia Zijie saw Yu Yaoyao’s beauty and saw her brand value, so he went straight to her to ask for her cooperation in marketing their products. He was calling her Mrs. Yu, Mrs. Yu the whole time, with a very enthusiastic attitude, but today, he looked like someone whom she owed eight million dollars!</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s mouth twitched, he signaled Yu Yaoyao to wait, then walked towards the camera where everyone was standing around. “Mr. Jia, Yu Yaoyao is here,” Ni Yi announced.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see.” Jia Zijie’s attitude was like a different person, he just pointed to the dressing room indifferently without even looking at them.</p>
<p>“Go there, everybody’s busy right now.” Jia Zijie answered simply, he did not even bother to introduce them to the director and just pointed their direction elsewhere.</p>
<p>“The photo of the studio that you sent me doesn’t look the same as this dressing room.” Ni Yi complained after seeing the dressing room.</p>
<p>Ni Yi usually would look at the site beforehand, and communicate with the makeup staff about the things to pay attention to before Yu Yaoyao would arrive at the set. For example, Yu Yaoyao particularly disliked the color of a blush that was as red as a monkey’s butt, and told him several times before about this. He already told all of these to the sponsors, advertisers, and assistant directors earlier.</p>
<p>But Jia Zijie sneered, “Today our other sub-brands have shootings too, and the main dressing room is kept for that endorser. She uses three sets of clothes herself, and all the other places are full, so we’ve already put those clothes inside.”</p>
<p>While Ni Yi was listening to him, a sharp voice suddenly sounded next to him.</p>
<p>“Someone’s already late by half an hour, and kept us waiting. Now you’re still occupied by trying to arrange the dressing room? This is not like living in a hotel, don’t be so picky!” A familiar voice said.</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s mouth twitched, he turned back and saw that the person who just talked was the director, Ji Chang.</p>
<p>“Director Ji?” How could he utter this bullshit?</p>
<p>“We confirmed with your assistant yesterday, that we’ll arrive at 9. You said we’ll start at 10, but Yu Yaoyao has another filming in the afternoon, so we told you that we would start an hour early. Now it’s only 8:30, we’re even early.”</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Ji Chang frowned, but didn’t speak immediately, “I told my assistant, eight o’clock.”</p>
<p>He gestured at a guy wearing a cap next to him.</p>
<p>Ni Yi saw him and realized he was the same guy he talked to on Weixin, “Chen, we have chat histo-!” He stopped abruptly and his eyes widened in realization that they did not have a chat history since they talked on the phone.</p>
<p>Now they couldn’t clear things up!</p>
<p>Sure enough, Assistant Chen Shen didn’t change a face. “Mr. Ni, I believe you heard it wrong.”</p>
<p>And now Ji Chang didn’t have the patience to keep listening to them, “Whatever, can we start now? How much more time do we need to waste?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi stepped back instantly.</p>
<p>All of them must have seen that Chen Jiao left Guangxin yesterday, and the collapse of the stock price this morning. Otherwise, was there another explanation for their change of attitude today? They were very respectful to them before, and always circled around them like eager children waiting for treats.</p></div>
