            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 107 – My Lonely Husband</strong></p>
<p>Everyone’s bodies shook! And Yu Yaoyao lost all her relaxed and chic behavior from before, her eyes widening. She immediately bowed her head, took a big serving of instant noodles with her fork to stuff it hastily inside her mouth, and lastly, she took a loud, big sip from the cup.</p>
<p>The sound of her hurried eating was the only thing reverberating in the room. And everyone couldn’t help but be shocked by her appearance.</p>
<p>And when they looked back, they saw Shen Yichong standing in the corridor like a towering, gloomy pine, with more than half of his icy face hidden in the shadows. He donned a dark trench coat with a suit inside, making him look sharp and imposing.</p>
<p>And suddenly, more than half of the instant noodles remaining in the cup was quickly stuffed by Yu Yaoyao into her already bulging her cheeks. She rushed from her room like a deer in a panic and crashed into his arms.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s body was knocked stiff by the soft matter that came barreling towards him.</p>
<p>But then he looked down, towards the woman in his arms…to see her oily, little mouth nearing his clothes. She buried her face into his chest and rubbed it against the clean material a few times.</p>
<p>His face was black. Did this woman use his shirt as a napkin just now?</p>
<p>“Let go.” Shen Yichong felt a throbbing pain in his temple.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao took advantage of the gap to hug his waist tightly and to bury her little face on his chest further; she would not let go. She was chewing hard. After all, it was not easy to swallow a large mouthful of noodles!</p>
<p>She wiped her mouth again before she finally looked up at him with a smile. “Husband…” she greeted timidly.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, when she thought of what just happened recently, the smile on her face disappeared instantly. It seems that in these types of scenes, most heroines would tremble with fear and then cry, asking the male lead to comfort her.</p>
<p><em>This is the best time to arouse the male lead’s desire for protection!</em> Yu Yaoyao smartly thought, and her delicate body instantly shook, entering to play.</p>
<p>“Wuuu, husband, someone bullied me just now. I was so scared. I almost choked on my noodles with so many people watching me.”</p>
<p>Everyone: “…”</p>
<p>Did she hit the nail? As Yu Yaoyao lifted her small face, she pretended to wipe her tears only to find out her tears won’t come out because she is too full! She can’t use hunger now to make herself cry!</p>
<p><em>Ah, a blunder!</em></p>
<p>She thought quickly and immediately thought of a new tactic. Looking back, she stretched out a finger towards Meng Xinran in the crowd.</p>
<p>“She also took away the limited-edition bag I bought for myself, got it on the ground and soiled it… For my birthday present, give me one bag every year. But oh, I’m so miserable, just how many birthdays do I even have left?”</p>
<p>When she spoke of this, her wide eyes turned red.</p>
<p>The panda, regarded as a national treasure, could celebrate a birthday. Even a Siberian tiger had a birthday. But when it comes to snakes like her, the keeper refused to throw her one!</p>
<p><em>How miserable! </em>When she thought about it, the golden beans fell from her eyes.</p>
<p>Everyone is looking on silly. Meanwhile, the deputy director coughed  and softly said, “Everyone, vacate the room. Meng Xinran, you stay.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran, with her clenched fists, was trembling all over.</p>
<p>Soon, she heard a cold voice say, “Don’t make trouble, I bought you a new one.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong held down Yu Yaoyao’s head and stopped her next attempt to wipe her snot and tears on his shirt. “This year’s limited edition bag will arrive tomorrow at the fastest, and I will have Chen Lin deliver it.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s sweet face instantly distorted with jealousy.</p>
<p><em>How could it be? Why does she have <strong>everything</strong>? Nothing is missing! A rich husband to buy her an expensive bag, to give her connections in the industry, a house, and even a car!</em> <em>But when it comes to me, I have to work many times harder and dare not make any mistakes. I have to make those producers happy and accompany the old men to drink!</em></p>
<p>How could she make a mistake in her carefully designed plan? What went wrong?</p>
<p>Meng Xinran lowered her head and never raised it because she could not hide her resentment and possessiveness any further.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wiped her tears with a smile and then released a small yawn towards Shen Yichong, which made his eyebrows clamp even tighter.</p>
<p>“By the way, husband, why are you here? Did you miss me? Oh, you can’t live through the night without me. Ah, why are you so gross…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong wanted to pinch her!</p>
