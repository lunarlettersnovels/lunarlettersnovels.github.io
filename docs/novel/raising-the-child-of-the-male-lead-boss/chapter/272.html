            <p><strong>Chapter 489</strong></p>
<p>After the premiere, it will take six days before “I Am a Killer” will be launched in theatres across the country. The industry insiders, as well as the movie fans and the audience who had a glimpse of it today, all thought they had a worthwhile trip after watching the movie.</p>
<p>“I’ll give it a high score! Its plot made me cry so badly…Yaoyao even had a baby in her belly throughout the filming of this movie that has so many action scenes and sad scenes! I really admire her!”</p>
<p>“I must persuade my other friends to watch this! I heard Yaoyao did all the action scenes herself without a body double. I wonder if they will release behind-the-scenes footage later. I look forward to it!”</p>
<p>“I knew it was the right thing to come to the cinema. Yaoyao’s face is impeccable, and she is in such good shape!”</p>
<p>“Oh no, I was only focusing on watching the plot, but I didn’t pay attention to Yaoyao’s belly. I didn’t see if it did get bigger! I guess I’ll just watch it again after the 24th.”</p>
<p>All the fans said that the ticket was worth their money. With pairs of red eyes, they all promised they would watch it again.</p>
<p>Professional film critics and new media writers quickly gave their evaluations of the film on the Internet.</p>
<p><em>“I will buy the tickets myself and watch it again after the release. Yu Yaoyao’s micro expressions and body language are already perfect, and her performance here is even better than “Year”!”</em></p>
<p><em>“There are some old-fashioned plots. I already guessed the ending after seeing the beginning. My mood has always been calm since the beginning, since I know that the female lead has to die, and the male lead will not marry for life. However, in the last two minutes, my tears flowed out of the corners of my eyes when I heard Xiao Yi’s last two sentences while lying in blood…I’m not sad, but I cried, for some reason.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Perhaps, this is the saddest movie of the year. The theme: ‘It doesn’t matter if you don’t love me, it’s enough as long as I love you.’ rings solemnly with our hearts.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I want to applaud Yu Yaoyao after watching the movie. She has always had a delicate appearance, but I didn’t expect a big breakthrough this time. She does a great job showing the character’s decisiveness and cold-blooded cruelty… A few action scenes done by her also looked heroic and interesting.”</em></p>
<p><em>“From today onwards, there is another almighty female artist in mainland China. She has played almost every role from young girl to woman, which is amazing.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The subject matter of the film is not new, but the script is ingenious. The director used a very new method to rewrite a cliched story. I think it is very good. It is one of the best art films this year. Using the name of an action film, it tells the love between men and women in the world.”</em></p>
<p>After the premiere, everyone stayed up all night to write, trying to ensure that they were ahead of their peers so that the public would read their reviews first. When office workers and students woke up the next day, they could already see the score of the film on Douban. There were also many movie reviews that were released in the early hours of last night.</p>
<p><strong>‘[SPOILERS] Analysing Yu Yaoyao’s Acting Growth Along The Way!’</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘I cried at the end of Xiao Yi’s character development’</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘At the cinema, I cried like a child who had lost my beloved toy’</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘</strong><em><strong>“I am a killer”</strong></em><strong> is an unexpected surprise!’</strong></p>
<p>Almost everyone who liked to watch movies had read these chapters, and many even reposted the articles on their handles. Fans who were movie fanatics were completely immersed. Meanwhile, the fans of the actors couldn’t wait to support their idols.</p>
<p>The tentative box office results of the premiere also made many people drop their jaws – it reached 1.5 billion! This achievement directly surpassed all the art films of that year and past history. It also broke the domestic record in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Many fans and movie fans were also complaining: <em>‘I want to book tickets, but the tickets after work in the theatres nearby are all sold out..I can only book for the weekend,’ ‘Increase the number of screenings!’…</em></p>
<p>Even on weekends, seats in many theatres in the first- and second-tier cities were almost full. Such achievements have made marketing accounts bring news that become constantly featured in the latest updates. All kinds of heart-wrenching and exaggerated editorial writing emerged one after another; each one wanted to become a hotspot to attract fans.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s fan base was also very lively every day, as if it was New Year’s Eve. They discussed Yaoyao’s acting skills and Little Sweetheart’s determination in the group every day.</p>
<p>With such a multi-party blessing, the box office of ‘Killer’ exceeded 2.9 billion in the first week of its release, and exceeded 500 million in the second week. The total box office of this film was almost certain to exceed 3 billion!</p>
<p>In the film and television industry, many people believe in a person’s luck. If you were destined to be popular, you would be successful in whatever you did. It was not a secret in the industry that celebrities would go abroad and have masters help them with their luck.</p>
<p>In the next few days, Director Liang and Screenwriter Liu received a lot of calls. In addition to congratulations, they also received many questions.</p>
<p>“Liang, I’ll just gossip and say what I saw on the Internet. Is it true that Yu Yaoyao went abroad to ask for an amulet? Do you know? Does that really work?”</p>
<p>“What? You don’t know? Come on, you know I won’t share the secret. You can count on you! You know, my wife also wanted to have a daughter, but she never got pregnant. Also, things have been turning out unfavourably recently, and my box office result isn’t good. Sigh!”</p>
<p>“Save a brother, please!”</p>
<p>Director Liang really didn’t know how to answer his friends’ questions.</p>
<p>“I haven’t seen any amulets… she only relied on her strength.”</p>
<p>“You’re overthinking.”</p>
<p>“Exercise more if you want a baby. As for box office… I guess I’m just lucky.”</p>
