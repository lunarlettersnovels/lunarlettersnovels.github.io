            <p><strong>Chapter 437</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong had no idea that so many things could happen in just a night. Although he was not at ease leaving his son outside when he accompanied Yaoyao into the delivery room, he had no other choice but to do so.</p>
<p>His parents had divorced a long time ago, and they weren’t in contact for several years. His father had also later married a mixed-race woman and had a child with her. Therefore, Shen Rui’s paternal grandparents couldn’t be relied on. Neither were Yu Yaoyao’s parents.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t even bother to notify them at all this time. Shen Rui was also not close with them, since they didn’t have much close contact before.</p>
<p>The reason why Shen Yichong brought the old housekeeper and babysitter with him, while having Chen Lin and Ni Yi accompany him, was to make Shen Rui feel at ease. However, he also knew that they could not replace the company of relatives. At most, they could only take care of his son and prevent him from entering danger.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt a little guilty for his son. But Yu Yaoyao needed him more yesterday. He had no choice but to let his young son wait outside.</p>
<p>Out of all his expectations, his own son, Shen Rui, was the one that had caused such a big incident in just one night.</p>
<p>There was even a mark of “popular” after the topic of #CallsWithBun#, which had become today’s big hit news.</p>
<p>The heat did not go down even after one whole night.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong understood the entertainment industry very well. At a glance, he knew all the operation behind these hot searches.</p>
<p>The hot topic regarding the best actor and actress that was now ranked first was able to maintain their rank because of the award ceremony organizer and the marketing team behind the two parties, in addition to the support of their respective fans.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t because of the support behind the scenes, #CallsWithBun# would definitely be ranked first.</p>
<p>As Shen Yichong clicked into the topic and glanced, the corners of his eyes were twitching.</p>
<p><em>[Yesterday, Yu Yaoyao won the best rookie and best supporting actress awards. As she was in labor, her five-year-old son picked up the call instead and delivered the speech. His childish speech added a piece of jubilant laughter to the award ceremony.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yu Yaoyao’s five-year-old son was on live broadcast asking everyone to call the manager…, he urged the public to contact him if there’s any child actor needed. He also mentioned he has great acting.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Fans were calling at night, queuing to be comforted by Little Bun!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Little Bun sharing beauty and slimming tips online. He’s a good man that you deserve to be with.]</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a look at the posts and realized that the hot search about his son was able to rank high because of its solid popularity!</p>
<p>There was even countless content! Many fans who managed to talk to him shared their conversation. In the beginning, he comforted the fans who were frustrated in life. Later, the fans became the ones who were comforting and worried about him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong found that there were at least 20 conversation records posted on the Internet.</p>
<p>As he turned his head and looked at his sleeping son who was still holding his little white snake doll, he couldn’t help but loosen his frown. He walked to his bed and helped him tuck the quilt.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong picked up his mobile phone and posted a Weibo post after organizing his thoughts.</p>
<p><em>[Thanks for your concern, our second baby is born. Both mother and daughter are safe, Yaoyao is also doing good.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Thank you also for taking care of my young son last night. Kids do not know what’s the right thing to say. Thank you all for your tolerance.]</em></p>
<p>He took a photo of his baby daughter’s small fist as an attached picture.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was not in the picture. Shen Yichong knew her preferences very well. She likes to post photos, but she must also be beautiful in each of them. Now that she was looking tired and weak, she definitely didn’t want her fans to see her like this.</p>
<p>After Shen Yichong posted on Weibo, he went to look at her again. He was finally relieved after finding that she was sound asleep.</p>
<p>In just one or two minutes, there were already many comments on his Weibo. The fans seemed to have been waiting for his official announcement. As soon as his post was released, they came to congratulate him one after another.</p>
<p><em>[Wow, the baby’s fist is so pinkish~ She’s also wearing pink clothes, how cute~]</em></p>
<p><em>[Congratulations, Mr. Shen and Yaoyao! But tolerance was not needed for Baby Rui. He is super obedient and cute. He was the one who tolerated us yesterday!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Congratulations, Mr. Shen~ Please don’t scold Little Bun. He comforted me last night. HIs childish words reflect his true temperament, and it was super heart-warming.]</em></p>
<p><em>[ It was Baby Rui who embraced us. As fans, we are obviously irrelevant to him, but he still spoke to us warmly, which really touches me. He even makes me reflect on how I usually treat my family, friends, and strangers. If you want to be treated with kindness, you must first treat others with kindness. Thank you Baby Rui for letting me understand this truth.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The little girl is so cute, I look forward to seeing your family of four interact~]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is Yaoyao awake? I hope she takes a good rest!]</em></p>
<p>Fans’ comments were building up. Many comments of blessings, care, and love for Little Bun have all been liked many times. However, there were always new messages bouncing on Shen Yichong’s cell phone notifications.</p>
<p>He had long set his Weibo to do-not-disturb mode. When he looked down, he found that it was the fan management group that was actively sending messages.</p>
<p>He created a subsidiary account last time, which was used to post clarifications for Yu Yaoyao. But after several rounds, it was actually targeted by the fan group administrator. Being half-reluctant, he joined the fan group after the fans insisted on having him in it. On the bright side, he was able to grasp the first-hand information of his wife’s fans.</p>
