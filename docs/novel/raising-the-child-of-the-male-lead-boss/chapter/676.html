            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 75 – Sabotage</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao understood immediately in seconds.</p>
<p>Back on the days where she couldn’t communicate verbally as a snake, she spent every day reading the zookeeper’s eyes. Therefore, she had learned the ability to read between the lines and naturally understood what the assistant director indirectly wanted to say.</p>
<p>That Meng Xinran wanted to do something again! No! She won’t be able to f*ck with her a second time!</p>
<p>She weighed the small, broken mirror in her hand, as a faint smile pulled out from her red lips—from the very start, she was never afraid; she hasn’t played a wild game like this for a long time. “Tsk tsk. What a pity this pretty, little mirror broke.” Yu Yaoyao licked her dry, red lips, her pair of bright eyes glinting with a dangerous light.</p>
<p><em>These people are the first to declare war on me!</em></p>
<p>Soon, she opened the paper where her performance title was written under the camera, and her beautiful eyes widened momentarily.</p>
<p><strong>[Acting Scene: Disfigurement. Performance requirements: Must make use of props to perform with acting lines for a duration of five minutes.]</strong></p>
<p>When Photographer Zheng saw the title, his eyes looked at Yu Yaoyao with some worry. Meanwhile, the assistant director’s smile widened more and said, “Get ready. You still have 28 minutes.”</p>
<p>For this five-minute performance of an abstract topic where not even a reference is given for the contestant—it can only be acted completely through a purely creative standpoint from the actor. Thus, the contestants were in a bit of a rush to get ready.</p>
<p>The assistant director had a second thought and added, “Hold on, for your nap, you won’t be compensated.” However, when his words had fallen, Yu Yaoyao unexpectedly did not show any panic-stricken expression. Instead, she graced him with a beautiful, dazzling smile.</p>
<p>“Disfigurement? Assistant director, are you so jealous of my beauty?” Her slim hand, fine as jade, slowly touched her little v-sculpted face, which was smooth as the shell of an egg.  “You are so bad.” Her watery eyes, full of teasing light, winked playfully at the assistant director.</p>
<p>The assistant director stepped back hastily. “No, no!” Why does he feel like he’s a big, bad wolf now?</p>
<p>“Get ready now. I’m going to the front stage!” The assistant director hurriedly ran away.</p>
<p>The photographer Zheng, who was carrying the camera, was only speechless. And Ni Yi was so frightened on seeing the assistant director so jumpy, feeling that his sister might have dared to say something again. After all, ever since she bumped her head, her narcissism had shot up to the sky by a feat!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao finally became somber. She got up and went to a corner, bringing the small mirror with her. Finally facing the broken mirror by herself, she began to think in peace and quiet.</p>
<p>The respective performance scenes will be acted out in an hour. Other contestants have already been preparing for half an hour, and some of the contestants, who were veteran actors, have already come up with a general idea for their topic. The next, latter half of the hour would be spent on repeatedly searching the right emotions to portray for the scene, deepening the character, as well as refining the lines.</p>
<p>Ni Yi could not go forward to guide, but on the whole process, his beady eyes were nervously focused solely on Yu Yaoyao’s body. Other contestants were walking back and forth, even adding body movements suitable for their performance topic. Only Yu Yaoyao, sitting in the corner at the moment, was looking at the mirror, like an old monk.</p>
<p>The photographer, Lao Zheng, was slowly approaching her with the camera on his shoulder.</p>
<p><em>Disfigurement can only be terrible news for a girl. </em>In his mind, it should take strong acting prowess to show a surge of emotions of grief or anger. And for a perfect-looking woman such as Yu Yaoyao, the blow of disfigurement should even be a tad heavier.</p>
<p>Of course, it could only mean more difficulty for <em>her.</em></p>
<p>But deep inside, he, too, was also curious about the real acting skills of the bizarre actress who had casually exchanged a pudding for his egg soup.</p>
