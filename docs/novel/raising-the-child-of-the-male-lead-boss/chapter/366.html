            <p><strong>Chapter 397</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was surprised when Shen Yichong exclaimed. “Chen Lin?” she said and looked around the room. Then she burst out laughing. “Darling, he’s not here.” Now that she was breathing easier, she reached out and gently touched Shen Yichong’s forehead. “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>The only assistant in the room was hers.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong turned to her assistant and said, “Xiao Xiang, call Chen Lin.” He squeezed his chopsticks tightly between his fingers.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt that her husband was being a little pushy again. “Let me call him. Xiao Xiang is still helping me with my clothes.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded, his expression stiff. He knew if he reached out to pick up his phone Yu Yaoyao would see his hands were trembling. He couldn’t recall having ever been in this nervous in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao quickly called Chen Lin. She was in quite a good mood and went so far as to imitate Shen Yichong’s anxious tone. This shocked Chen Lin a little.</p>
<p>Before Chen Lin arrived, Yu Yaoyao thought everything was okay. But when she saw him, she was shocked to discover his expression was even more serious than Shen Yichong’s.</p>
<p>After working with Shen Yichong for so many years, Chen Lin could tell at a glance that his boss was not in his right mind. He was afraid that something big was happening.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao reluctantly ate a few mouthfuls of white rice while she watched Shen Yichohng. She finally realized that there did indeed seem to be something troubling her husband. “Darling, are you really okay? Why are you so pale? You’re sweating.” She stretched and wiped the sweat off his forehead.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong grabbed her hand. “Let’s go to the hospital.”</p>
<p>“What?” Yu Yaoyao was shocked. “It’s it that serious?”</p>
<p>She could never recall a time she had seen Shen Yichong sick. Ever since she had known him, he had been in perfect health.</p>
<p>Chen Lin was also under the impression that Shen Yichong was unwell, so he hurried over to help him.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao also helped him stand.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t know whether he should cry or laugh. His wife was so funny that it helped to break the tense atmosphere from earlier. “I’m okay.”</p>
<p>He helped Yu Yaoyao instead after asking Chen Lin to fetch the car</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was confused, and her expression remained serious. She thought her husband was merely being a proud man and refusing to let others see his soft side.</p>
<p>She immediately pressed her body closer to him. “You can lean on me,” she said softly. “Xiao Xiang, please go to Director Liang and apply for leave for me. I’m taking my husband to the hospital.” She insisted on holding onto Shen Yichong as they left the crew.</p>
<p>When they got to the car, Shen Yichong squeezed her into the seat and soon they were on their way. The entire crew knew about the incident less than 10 minutes after they’d left.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen had been at the crew all day with his wife, while he’d been busy with work. He had probably gotten sick because he was so tired. And now Yu Yaoyao was rushing him to the hospital.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour, all the paparazzi lurking around the crew got the news. They quickly made their way to the hospital to take pictures.</p>
<p>The first wave of blurry photos was released within an hour and went directly onto the hot search.</p>
<p>Ever since the loving interaction in ‘Wife’, the YY fans hadn’t gotten any updates about Yu Yaoyao. Everyone was excited when they saw the word hospital.</p>
<p>A second baby!</p>
<p>But when they read the title, they were confused.</p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen’s fallen ill? Shouldn’t this be about the second baby?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Sigh! Mr. Shen should pay attention to his health. If he is going to be on medicine, they won’t be able to have a baby for another month, right?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Anxious!]</em></p>
<p>There were also reasonable fans who told everyone to not think about the second baby at that moment.</p>
<p><em>[Our Yaoyao is filming a movie. A female killer has a lot of action scenes.]</em></p>
<p><em>[I saw her manager’s post from last month. Yaoyao was boxing!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I guess we won’t be meeting a baby anytime soon!]</em></p>
<p>Everyone felt a little sad for a while.</p>
<p>Back at the hospital, Yu Yaoyao was confused by all the registrations, inspections and forms she had to fill in. “Why am I the one getting a check-up?”</p>
<p>They waited for half an hour for the test report to came back. After listening to the doctor, she was even more dazed and in a state of utter disbelief.</p>
<p>“I… I’m pregnant?” She covered her belly in shock and panic.</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>She didn’t feel pregnant.</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Her filming schedule had been tight recently. She even had to push back her shopping arrangements with Xiao Sisi. She was too busy to think about nonsense and when she got home at the end of the day, she usually just fell asleep.</p>
<p>Even Little Bun was sensible and didn’t disturb her. He played by himself, or with his kindergarten friends.</p>
<p>After dinner every evening, Yu Yaoyao always felt her eyes getting heavy. Shen Yichong would then take her to the room where she would cry for a little while. Once she had relieved some of her stress, she would sleep soundly until the next morning. Then the next day she would be as active and as lively as she always was.</p>
<p>There was nothing unusual.</p>
<p>The doctor laughed, “Haven’t you seen a change in yourself? Sore breasts, late period, and a low moods?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao ticked all these off on her fingers, only realizing now that she was experiencing all of these. “Well…” she touched her nose in embarrassment. “I thought it was because I wasn’t eating properly. I thought I wasn’t getting all the vitamins I needed.” She knew she had to eat healthy to have regular periods.</p>
