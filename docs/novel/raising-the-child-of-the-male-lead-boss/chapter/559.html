<p>Shen Yichong’s face had a slight shadow. When glimpsed through the camera lens of the crew of ‘Wife and I’, it had seemed dark to the point of blushing.</p>
<p>By the time Yu Yaoyao ran over to snatch the script in horror, it was too late. He had clearly seen both what should and shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>“Husband, that…..”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao couldn’t even form a few words before her cheeks turned crimson as a cloud at sunset. She immediately reached out her hands to cover her cheeks, she could feel her face burning up.</p>
<p><em>Ruined! Done for!</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t bring herself to face anyone, let alone her husband, who she wrote about!! All the notes she had written on the script were based on her inspiration from Xiao Yi’s suggestions in order to place herself in Yu Ji’s shoes!! She could only bring out that sort of emotion when she thought of Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Well, there was one thing that Yu Haiquan got wrong. Appetite cannot be the basis for all scenes. After all, eating is a simple, basic instinct, how can it represent such complicated emotions?</p>
<p>As she mulled over, Yu Yaoyao fluttered her eyes and motioned to Shen Yichong. “Let’s return home, shall we? We can pick our son up along the way, okay?”</p>
<p>She was flustered, and could only hear the loud throbbing of her heart.</p>
<p>Such words had been laid bare, she wanted to dig herself a hole to hide in!</p>
<p>“Afterwards, you kissed him….”</p>
<p>A low, husky voice sounded. It carried a familiar breath laced with fresh mint that brushed over her sensitive earlobes…</p>
<p>A fierce quiver coursed through her body. Suffused with embarrassment, Yu Yaoyao buried her petite face in her hands. Then, she parted her delicate fingers ever so slightly to reveal her cherry red lips.</p>
<p>“Hm…”</p>
<p>“Husband, I.. I… I didn’t want to kiss him… I… I couldn’t bring myself to kiss him.”</p>
<p>The moment she uttered these shameful words, she whimpered; by now even her ears were beet red. Unable to endure it any longer, covering her face she quickly made way from Shen Yichong’s side to stand behind him.</p>
<p>“Husband, you… you go first, don’t look back at me!”</p>
<p>Her smooth white skin, whiter than snow… perpetually cold and aloof, had been her pride. But now, it was redder than the next door baboon’s butt in the zoo!!</p>
<p><em>Unsightly… Definitely can’t let him see her embroiled in such a state!</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned as he listened to her. Her soft, fluttering voice hit him straight in the heart and melted him like spring snow.</p>
<p><em>Struck right in the middle of his chest! Meng!</em></p>
<p>The words may have been soft and seemingly ineffective, but it had hammered him at full strength and almost made him lose his footing! His head was buzzing. The corners of his mouth slowly curled up.</p>
<p>Oblivious to it all, she kept mumbling in a sheepish, charming voice. He couldn’t make out what she was saying, and when he turned around to better understand her, he was met with the sight of her little, tinted cheeks, blossoming in a deep shade of pink and shining in the sun.</p>
<p>It seemed like a dam had broken in his heart, letting out an endless stream of clear spring water.</p>
<p><em>Couldn’t bring herself to kiss that male artist? Only wants to kiss him and him alone?</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong increasingly curled the arc of his mouth, and before he could think further, he couldn’t control himself.</p>
<p>“Mommy!”</p>
<p>But before they could take any more steps, a loud and tender voice accompanied by a shadow as pink as Peppa Pig rushed at them full speed. All of a sudden, the shadow threw itself at them.</p>
<p>The sudden weight hanging off his lovey dovey atmosphere set Shen Yichong’s smile straight at once. Even Yu Yaoyao’s hand, which had been firmly grasping at the back of his windbreaker, had been snatched away by this unwanted little third wheel!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face sank at once. “Shen Rui, didn’t daddy tell you to wait in the car?”</p>
<p>The little bun who was already holding his mother’s hand with one paw reached his other grubby paw to point at his face and grumbled, dejected.</p>
<p>“Wearing a mask, Daddy.. And sunglasses… Also, Uncle accompanied me…” He started proudly, pointing behind.</p>
<p>Immediately, Zhao Yu’s familiar old face reappeared.</p>
<p>“Hey there! Mr. Shen, Xiao Yu, off work already? Going to eat?” he asked.</p>
<p>Even an experienced cameraman like Old Zheng was startled to see him suddenly pop out of nowhere. But that was exactly the effect Zhao Yu was aiming for!</p>
<p>“You two, here’s the second task card of “Wife and I”, please take a look.”</p>
<p>If it were any other day, Yu Yaoyao would have been the first to jump and snatch the card to take a look at it in curiosity. But today, one hand was busy hiding her blushing face, while the other was held by the little bun.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pursued his lips, glanced at the expectant face of Director Zhao in front of him and reservedly took the task card.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao simply picked up the excited little bun and bashfully held his fluffy head against her cheek. Standing on tiptoe behind Shen Yichong, she peeked her slightly protruding, watery pair of eyes brimming with curiosity to catch a glimpse of the card in his hand.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em><strong>“Mr. and Mrs. Shen Yichong , </strong></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>You have been with each other for five years. Whether in the face of public praise or doubt, whether you are standing at the peak or low of your career, you have always been walking shoulder to shoulder as equals to welcome the next beautiful day. Love and tolerance, understanding and support, are precious lessons you’ve given everyone. Today, I hope you can resurface and gift such precious moments to each other once again, and prepare a hearty dinner for your dearest husband (or wife) with love!”</strong></em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao read the task card out loud, word by word. After reading it, she proceeded to bury her red face in the Peppa Pig hat of a particular little bun called Shen Rui once again.</p>
<p>Ashamed!</p>
<p><em>What love or not to love~ The Director was really bad!</em></p>
<p>Her heart was racing faster than the fastest wind!</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Apologies for the lack of updates. Was feeling under the weather for the past few weeks and so updates for my novels have been staggering… will pick up pace in the next few days. Happy holidays to everyone! I hope these chapters warm your hearts &lt;3</em></p></div>
