            <p><strong>Chapter 504</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, Shen Rui, who couldn’t appear on the big screen this year and couldn’t go to the scene with Mommy, also felt a bit melancholic. He had grown up, and yet,  he could still only watch Mommy through the TV. Sigh!</p>
<p>“Little Sweetheart, I really envy you,” he began. “You’re only two years old now. You still have several years to run around with Mommy. Maybe in the future even if you cry, that cold-faced beast will still promise you anything.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui couldn’t hold back, and he poked Little Sweetheart in her cheek.</p>
<p>Little Sweetheart suddenly exerted her child-like instincts and she howled! Even if it was her brother who poked her, she cried so hard as if she was heartbroken. All of a sudden, Shen Yichong, the daughter’s slave, was summoned.</p>
<p>“Little Sweetheart, did your brother bully you?” Shen Yichong hugged Little Sweetheart  in his arms without any hesitation. He lowered his head and softly coaxed his daughter. “Daddy will bully him back for you.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui, who almost had a hole in his right cheek, looked at his cold-faced father speechlessly. Seeing this, the little girl finally laughed in Shen Yichong’s arms. Shen Yichong finally showed a satisfied smile. To him, holding his daughter felt like he was holding the whole world.</p>
<p>“Daddy, you’ve changed,” Shen Rui said, snorting.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong lowered his eyes as he hugged his daughter. “You have also changed, you bully even your younger sister now.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui, who only poked his sister in the cheek, suddenly felt that he couldn’t even prove that he was not guilty, no matter what he did.</p>
<p>“Daddy, you’re not even worried when Mommy is at the awards ceremony,” Little Bun accused.</p>
<p>“I’m not worried because I trust her,” he replied. Shen Yichong glanced at the big screen in the room that was broadcasting the live award show.</p>
<p>When Shen Rui raised his head, he seemed to see softness in his father’s eyes. As if there was telepathy, Yu Yaoyao seemed to have noticed the camera in the scene at the moment. She smiled and showed a love sign towards the camera. The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched slightly, and a smile that emerged suddenly melted the coldness on his face.</p>
<p>At the award ceremony, the voice of the presenter sounded. “The Best Actress Film, the winner of this award is…’I Am a Killer’, Yu Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>“As the critics said, Yu Yaoyao’s superb acting skills showed us a fully-fleshed character. She is beautiful, but ugly; she has kindness, but her hands are covered in blood… From not knowing and understanding love to slowly experiencing the warmth of the world, and finally finding the awakening of humanity, she completed the transition and growth in life by the end! Congratulations, Yaoyao, please come to the stage to accept the award!”</p>
<p>The fans in the live broadcast room got to a frenzy in an instant. They spammed the comment section with the slogan given by the president, Big Head.</p>
<p><em><strong>[You’re the best, Yaoyao!]</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>[She deserves it!]</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>[You are the best!]</strong></em></p>
<p>In the camera, Yu Yaoyao also got up with a smile. She hugged Director Liang and Writer Liu, who were even more excited than her. After hugging several other actresses who were also nominated for the Best Actress Award, she finally got on the stage.</p>
<p>“Thank you, everyone,” she began.  Yu Yaoyao blinked at the camera. “The fans have been waiting for a long time. Fortunately, I’m not pregnant with a third child this year. In order not to miss the awards ceremony, we’ve also spent a lot of effort on contraception during this time.”</p>
<p>Everyone was chuckling off-stage. The fans in the live broadcast room were also laughing hard.  Shen Yichong, who had already got the kids in the car, was speechless when he heard this from Little Bun’s tablet.</p>
<p>“Chen Lin, let’s go to the scene.”</p>
<p>“Okay, boss.”</p>
<p>Holding the tablet, Shen Yichong squeezed into the back seat of the car with his son and daughter to watch the follow-up of the live broadcast. They saw Yu Yaoyao, who made a joke at the ceremony, take out a small note from her handbag. “Theoretically, I have to memorize it, but then you won’t be able to feel my nervousness that way,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’ll just read it shamelessly. Let me show off the speaking skills I recently learned from Teacher Big Head…” she cleared her throat, “First of all, thanks CCTV…”</p>
<p>The audience continued to laugh. The YY fans watching the live broadcast spammed the comment section again.</p>
<p><em><strong>[Our president is mighty! ‘Thanks CCTV,’ – are you trying to make me die of laughter?]</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>[Dear President, can you ask the English teacher first next time? Your choice of words seems to be inappropriate for formal occasions!]</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>[The head of the YY fanclub also showed her face indirectly! Hahaha!]</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>[Seems like she didn’t learn English for nothing. Great job!]</strong></em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, and he reached out to cover his forehead. Yesterday, his wife was muttering with a small note before going to bed. He knew it was an acceptance speech, so he didn’t ask too much. He absolutely believed in her ability to get on hot search and attract fans. But he didn’t expect that the testimonials turned out to be in English…</p>
<p>“…and finally, I love you all.”After Yu Yaoyao finished reading, she seriously  folded the small note again and stuffed it back into her handbag.</p>
<p>“See you next year, babies! I’ll be back! Feel free to comment under my Weibo what language should my speech be next time. Mwahh~”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Moderator &amp; organizer: “…”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye watching the live broadcast: “…”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At the end of the ceremony, the reporters all wanted to find Yu Yaoyao for an interview, but she was nowhere to be found. It wasn’t until half an hour later that everyone found her Weibo status that she was having a candlelight dinner. This family of four was having a good time eating salt-baked lobsters!</p>
<p><em><strong>[YuYaoyao V: I’m sorry everyone, I’m really hungry, so I left early to eat! Congrats to @DaFu for winning the Best Animation Award, and congratulations to Director Li Bo for winning the Best Cinematography Award! Congratulations to @LiuYazhi for Best Screenplay Award… We will continue to work hard together in the future!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I said, I bring good luck to my husband, right!? @BigHead, is my choice of words correct?]</strong></em></p>
