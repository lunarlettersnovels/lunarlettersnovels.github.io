<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>He looked at his father bitterly. Shen Yichong avoided looking at his son. His heart would melt if Little Bun kept this up. But his tiny hands pulled at Shen Yichong’s sleeves.</p>
<p>“Dad, are you done educating me?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, why?” asked Shen Yichong, confused.</p>
<p>“I want to ask something,” he said, “Why can’t you ask for leave? Why can’t you take leave for a few days and take care of mommy while I can’t?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pulled at Shen Yichong’s other sleeve, trying not to laugh. “Yes,” she said, chuckling, “Why can’t you?”</p>
<p>“Dad,” said Little Bun, “I know it’s my fault that I lied but why can’t I take leave when something worrying happens?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t hold back his laugh. “Because you are still a kid,” he said, “I am the boss of my own company but I do need to take care of it so I might not be able to take so much time off. If you become a boss of your own company, you can take as much time off as you want. But right now, you have to listen to your parents and your teachers, alright?” He ruffled his son’s hair.</p>
<p>Little Bun pouted. His teachers told him that he needed permission from his father if he wanted a leave. There was no way he could get a leave on his own. Yu Yaoyao picked him up into a warm embrace.</p>
<p>“Don’t blame your dad,” she said gently, “He does this for your own good. If you don’t study hard then you won’t be able to have your own company and take time off as much as you want.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui nodded. He decided to study hard so he could be his own boss, then he wouldn’t need anybody’s approval. Shen Yichong smiled at them both, then cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“If your throat is still sore, you can ask for leave from the script-reading,” he suggested.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s good,” she said, “It’s just the beginning and I don’t want to leave a bad impression.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” he assured her, “It’s for your health. Besides, I am investing in the drama and will need to discuss with Director Qi Hang regarding it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s necessary,” she said, “I don’t think it’s good to exercise that kind of power.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao understood what it felt like to be associated with someone of power. Even so, it left a bitter taste in her mouth to do that. So, she attended the afternoon meeting anyway. She took lozenges and medicine prescribed by the doctor, and diligently attended the meetings.</p>
<p>Director Qi Hang was worried that when the filming started, her mood would be affected by whatever was going on in her life. But she handled it quite well. She was so focused and professional in the shooting of her scenes that Director Qi Hang was impressed.</p>
<p>While the crew arranged the next scene, he discussed it with Yu Yaoyao. “This scene will be more difficult,” he said, while handing her a tissue. Yu Yaoyao was still sniffling. Her previous scene had been a crying scene.</p>
<p>“This particular scene is where you go look for a job,” he said, “After the divorce, he gave you so little and his mistress took half the asset. Your son is seriously ill, so you need to find money for his treatment. But you have lived so long as a housewife that you have no professional skill. The interviewer at a company you applied for, judged you by the fact that despite your age, your qualification and experiences remain inadequate. The emotions need to be in layers. You are angry, but you are helpless. You need a job, but you are doubting your capabilities as well.”</p>
<p>Director Qi Hang paused and looked at her. “Do you understand?” he asked, “It will be different from yelling at your ex-husband and his mistress. That time what you felt was distress but a certain kind of confidence that you are going to walk away and make a life of your own. You were unbreakable. But here, you are humbly waiting to be selected for a job, you get the call from the doctor about your son’s condition, and you realize you need this job no matter what. The many emotions need to be expressed through micro-expression.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao listened patiently and made some notes on the script. “Understood.”</p>
<p>Director Qi Hang nodded. “Okay,” he said, “Then we will get started after the preparation is finished and after you get changed into your props.”</p>
