            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 93 – Scapegoat</strong></p>
<p>Of the young male actors on the scene, only Chen Jiao was the appropriate actor to act alongside the female contestants. If Yu Yaoyao were to act together with Chen Jiao, then she would be finished sooner than she did!</p>
<p>The audience was stirred by this proposition and there was immediately an uproar. Even a lot of Chen Jiao’s fans in the audience filled the set with excited screams.</p>
<p>“We want to see a double performance!”</p>
<p>“A rival play, director!”</p>
<p>Next to judging panel, the director group had to call for a temporary halt on the performance. One of them walked towards Chen Jiao’s side to privately discuss something in a low voice. Chen Jiao looked somewhat surprised, but his face soon erupted to a small smile as he nodded to the director. Soon after, all the judges came to a conclusion together with the directors.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, who still hasn’t performed on stage, will partner with the actor Chen Jiao. Thirty minutes of preparation time will also be given to the contestant. And for fairness, all the players in the cheating madam topic group will be able to perform twice, alongside with the film emperor, Chen Jiao and have their scores reevaluated. The audience, or the judges for that matter, can also abstain from voting, and the results from the contestant’s first performance will be recorded as the final evaluation for this round.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Meng Xinran bowed her head and revealed a ferocious, triumphant smile.</p>
<p>She knew that the director wanted the show to be the subject of gossip and hot trending searches every time! Compared with the double performance of other female artists with the film emperor, who could compare to Yu Yaoyao, who had a recent scandal with Chen Jiao? It was not fairness–this was only bound to raise the ratings of program instead.</p>
<p><em>Yu Yaoyao, you are dead!</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao, who had been gazing at the mirror and admiring her appearance for half an hour, was soon updated with the new change.</p>
<p>She looked at the camera held by old photographer Zheng, the corners of her red lips unable to stop from rising.</p>
<p>“Act with that handsome film emperor? Thirty minutes of preparation time? No need; I can go directly.”</p>
<p>“Elder sister Yu, a double performance is different. There will be problems without proper preparation,” Zhao Xiaomeng worriedly tried to dissuade her from being rash.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, looked at the picture of a Korean drama on her mobile phone, locked the screen and handed her mobile phone over.</p>
<p>“Little beauty, I was born ready.”</p>
<p>Acting as a beggar was never in her mind. From the very beginning, what she was looking for was the role of a wife! There are so many beautiful women, wanted by men, that like to make their husbands jealous.</p>
<p>Isn’t that her? Why does she still have to prepare?</p>
<p><em>Haha</em>! This little guy Meng Xinran still wants to compete with her with her small IQ?</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao clasped both hands together in front of the photographer who accompanied her. Like a lovestruck fool, her eyes were full of love like gushing spring water, unable to be stopped at all.</p>
<p>“Dear husband, I’m going to perform on stage. Today… I’m going to act as an unfaithful woman.”</p>
<p>She said, biting her lips, “This role makes me feel painful and struggling. But as long as I think of your love for me, no matter how much suffering and grievances I currently have, I will not be afraid. If you start an entertainment company, I will naturally become the queen of the entertainment circle and accompany you to the highest peak!”</p>
<p>When it came to her concluding statement, her eyes sparkled, but she was also tearing up from her words.</p>
<p>Both the old photographer Zheng and Zhao Xiaomeng were stupefied. Originally, they were very concerned about the gossip crisis to happen if her performance was to be broadcasted.</p>
<p><em>She’s resolving it beforehand?</em></p>
<p>Before she was to act on stage, she has already expressed her love to her husband…or was it actually a forceful and domineering declaration that she wanted to be part of the broadcast later? If then, how many viewers would still think she was cheating? Perhaps, people engrossed in watching TV shows would be even moved to tears by this statement!</p>
<p>As Yu Yaoyao blew a kiss towards the camera, she got up gracefully and confidently strutted towards the backstage.</p>
