            <p><strong>Chapter 382</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was also ready. She had changed into another outfit. She was wearing a pair of tight-fitting jeans and a long-sleeved shirt. Over this she had a chef’s coat, unbuttoned at the chest. The outfit made her look quite handsome. Her long, dark hair had been pulled back off her face and was pinned in place by a pair of chopsticks. With her hair out the way, her smooth, beautiful face was on full display.</p>
<p>The shooting hadn’t even started, and she was already professionally turning the chicken wings on the grill. She added a handful of salt to the condiment bowl next to her, swirled it around and then tossed it over the meat. Her movements were smooth and deceptively skillful. The entire scene had a surreal aura about it.</p>
<p>Her cool look made the group of fans want to scream before the filming had even started.</p>
<p>The staff quickly quieted the crowds. “Everyone please be quiet so we can record their voices. If we end up recording your cheers, Sister Yu and Brother Qiu will have to re-act the scene. Thank you for your cooperation.”</p>
<p>The fans in the front row started vibrating with excitement. “If they have to re-act the scene, that means we get to see them for longer!”</p>
<p>The person who said this was scolded by others sitting behind them. “No, Dayaoyao has to stay healthy for her second baby. She can’t be tired. We should let her finish the filming early so she can go home.”</p>
<p>The excited fan sighed softly. “Oh, right… Fine, I’ll let my husband finish the filming so she can go home and throw herself on Mr. Shen.”</p>
<p>The staff were speechless. Qiu Dajian was dumbstruck. And Yu Yaoyao was still clueless about her fans’ tricks.</p>
<p>As soon as the shooting started, she turned the steaming chicken wings over and over again. Then she looked up and shouted down the road, “You don’t want to miss this! Come on! Come and take closer look! Authentic, sauteed, roasted wings! The tender, juicy skin has been grilled to a perfect golden brown. Although this technique has been imitated for hundreds of years, it has never been as good as the old-fashioned way! This smell is something found only in heaven. We mortals don’t get to smell this every day. Bro, would you like to taste a little piece of heaven?”</p>
<p>The fans quickly covered their mouths to stop themselves from laughing at these ridiculous lines.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian, who had been standing at the guide rails near the camera, walked into the shot. Just as it had said in the script, he gave her a contemptuous look. He was ready to call the city management to report her as an unlicensed stall, but before he could do anything, Yu Yaoyao pressed him against the wheelbarrow. His throat was suddenly gripped between two oily chicken wings.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian was surprised when she pushed him against the wheelbarrow. So very, very surprised! According to the script, she was supposed to press him against the wall, not against the seat of the wheelbarrow. And what the hell was with the chicken wings?</p>
<p>He raised his face, turning his head to look at Director Zhu in disbelief, trying to figure out what he was supposed to do next. But as he moved, the two searing hot chicken wings burnt his throat.</p>
<p>“It’s hot!” he hissed, craning his neck back with a frown.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao chuckled above him. “Of course it’s hot! I used environmentally friendly gas and carefully crafted iron plates that I personally polish every day. That way I know my cooking will be perfect. I paint every chicken wing carefully with oil, and then I massage it into the skin. After being grilled at 156 degrees, the skin is perfectly crispy. Every day I make each and every piece of chicken fresh. That is the truth!”</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian blinked in confusion. Was she still running her lines? “Wait,” he said, “I haven’t even called to report…”</p>
<p>According to the script, she was only supposed to give her next series of actions after he’d made the call to urban management.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian could feel a headache coming on.</p>
<p>He tried to speak, but the hot chicken wings were pressed firmly against his throat again.</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Yu Yaoyao said. “Do you really think I’m going to stand here and let you make that call? Do you think I’m a fool, young man?”</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian’s face twitched. He had forgotten the script had loopholes.</p>
<p>But wasn’t she supposed to be doing this to advance the plot? She was supposed to try and sell him the chicken wings quickly before she got into trouble. He was supposed to hate the unhygienic stall but adore the taste of the food after just one bite.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian also realized that Director Zhu Junfei hadn’t called for a “cut”, so he was obviously invested.</p>
<p>How should he continue with his own lines?</p>
<p>“How dare you say that when you’re operating without a license!” Qiu Dajian had barely finished speaking before the chicken wings were shoved into his mouth.</p>
<p>“Delicious chicken wings! Eight Yuan for one and 20 for a pair!” Yu Yaoyao shook her chef’s coat elegantly, turned around and brought a money box to him. She bent over and leaned close to his handsome face, showing a clean but scornful smile.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian was in shock.</p>
<p>Then Yu Yaoyao reached out and pressed against his chest. As she turned to him, the corners of her pure white coat waved neatly through the air. Her flawless, delicate, beautiful face was barely a centimeter from his. She was so close to him that he could smell the faint cumin scent on her.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian couldn’t help but swallow his saliva, or that his handsome eyes glittered a little more.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s appearance was definitely among the best in the female artists’ group. She looked exquisite from a distance and was still flawless up close.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajin found his breathing had quickened a little, and that the base of his ears had started getting hot. His body was reacting to her in a very natural way.</p>
<p>When he stayed silent and brooding, Yu Yaoyao grabbed his chin. “Eat. You obviously want them!”</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian blushed, and immediately bit one of the chicken wings. But in the next moment, his trance-like state was broken.</p>
<p>“Cut!” Zhu Junfei called. “Xiao Qiu, you look like you’re in pain. How is that the expression of someone tasting something delicious? Do it again!”</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian’s mouth twitched slightly as his blush faded and he returned to normal.</p>
<p>They redid the shot five times before it was finally passed.</p>
<p>As soon as the director announced a break, the previously quiet fans started screaming.</p>
<p>“My husband is so cool! Husband, I want to be the chicken wing in you!”</p>
<p>“I wish I could be Brother Jian so Dayaoyao could pin me like that…”</p>
<p>“My husband’s lines are so cool!”</p>
<p>“Can I have the leftover chicken wings?”</p>
<p>“Please let me have one of the wings my husband grilled! I’ll even pay for it!”</p>
<p>All the fans started putting in requests to taste the chicken wings.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian had gone to his assistant to get a drink of water from his bottle. The fans’ last words made his expression twist painfully.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, was delighted. “Sure! Let’s not waste food. I will grill the rest so everyone can eat.”</p>
<p>She cut off the parts of the wings that Qiu Dajian had bitten, leaving only the untouched pieces.</p>
<p>While the director was resting, she handed pieces out to the fans. Since there weren’t enough wings, she cut them into several bits so the fans could all get a taste. Even though the production team had brought extra, there was no waste.</p>
<p>Watching from a car parked not too far away was Chen Jiao. He took off his sunglasses, pursed his lips and said to his assistant, “Go and get one.”</p>
<p>The assistant was startled and looked at him in shock.</p>
<p>“Hurry up,” Chen Jiao said with a frown.</p>
<p>There were so many fans, and it seemed that the wings Yu Yaoyao had personally grilled were nearly finished.</p>
