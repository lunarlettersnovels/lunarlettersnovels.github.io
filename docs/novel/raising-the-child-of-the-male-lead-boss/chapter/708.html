            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 43 – Shen Yichong’s Plea</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong was about to come over and help him put on his little clothes, but he was stunned by the steamed bun’s unexpected words.</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Dad, you’re an adult now. It’s time to learn to sleep by yourself,” the little steamed bun hooted!</p>
<p>Mommy had told him back when they were in the hospital that she always kept away from him because she was afraid her baby would not become strong and independent in the future.</p>
<p>Thus, she didn’t sleep or play with him.</p>
<p>But now that he thinks about it carefully…every time he wakes up to pee, he hears the quarrel between his parents.</p>
<p>What does that mean? It means that dad is sleeping together with his mommy!</p>
<p>The small steamed bun instantly looked at his father’s eyes, with the eyes of a little, angry demon of the night.</p>
<p><em>Since you think mommy is stupid and don’t like her carelessness, then don’t occupy mommy’s sleep! Dad is such a big baby! </em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong was under onslaught with his son’s despising eyes and tense body rejecting his touch.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help raise his eyebrows further, his temples slowly throbbing.</p>
<p>“Shen Rui, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p><em>Hey! Daddy’s gonna play dumb!</em></p>
<p>The small steamed bun’s eyes like big grapes were caught by surprise. But very quickly, he coolly got up from the bed to neatly put on his little trousers, and lastly, his tiny socks.</p>
<p>“Dad, when you used to sleep with mommy, I didn’t get in your way.”</p>
<p>He stood on the bed, barely reaching his father’s chest. His mouth was pouting as he said his protests; his twinkling eyes, as beautiful as the night stars, held an obvious glimmer of sadness and grievances.</p>
<p>“Mommy—when mommy will hug me next time…I don’t know when.”</p>
<p>“Dad,” whispered said Shen Rui, who lowered his head, “If mommy hits her head again, will she change back and not want to be near me… won’t she like me anymore?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong grimaced lightly, and put his arms around his son’s tiny body, “Don’t think about it.”</p>
<p>His son is only five years old, but like him, he is precocious. It was probably because both of them got too little of a maternal love and were forced to grow up earlier than other children.</p>
<p>His boy is no fool.</p>
<p>Even he thought, Yu Yaoyao’s change in personality would only go one for a few days. And when the child is past that period of excitement at the change of treatment, he will be in doubt again.</p>
<p>And apparently, the little steamed stuffed bun had tasted the sweet intimate contact with his mommy for the past few days. They had meals together, watched his online school together, went to an amusement park together, had received his first genuine hugs and kisses from her, and today…his mommy told him she misses him always.</p>
<p>In this new atmosphere where, sweet honey was dripping on him, making him the happiest baby, the little steamed bun is afraid of these things being temporary only.</p>
<p>The child was afraid that his mother would abandon him again.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt a dull pain assault his chest, “Let’s go downstairs. Have dinner with dad.”</p>
<p>In his work every day he always deals with decisions quickly and decisively. But when it comes to his son, he feels as if he is stuck in a thick mud.</p>
<p>He can continue to deceive his son with this temporary happiness, but he can only hide it from him for two or three years.</p>
<p>He had hesitations in his heart.</p>
<p>But when he took his son’s hand and they went out of their rooms, they heard Yu Yaoyao’s impatient voice drifting from the dining room. The steamed bun jumped up suddenly.</p>
<p>And just like a small animal, the white and fat steamed bun happily ran towards the front, pulling on his dad’s hand.</p>
<p>“Mommy said it’s dinner time! Dad, let’s go!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at his little back and finally nodded, “Okay. Go first.”</p>
<p><em>I hope you give your child two more years of a carefree life.</em></p>
