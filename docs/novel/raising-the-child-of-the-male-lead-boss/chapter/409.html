            <p><strong>Chapter 354</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Chen Jiao, who was feeling completely abandoned, kept staring at his phone screen every minute, then every second. There was no response to his text message, no matter how desperately he waited. Finally, he slammed his fist on the table and pressed the cigarette dead in the ashtray. He finally admitted to himself that he wasn’t getting a reply.</p>
<p>The computer on his desk was playing the variety show, ‘My Wife and I’.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s frowns and smiles, the soft whispers when she talked to Shen Yichong, and the loving interaction with Little Bun… All of them were displayed in front of him.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao lowered his head and ran his hands through his messy hair. To his left, there were two archived records. One was Yu Yaoyao’s, and the other was Ling Shuang’s.</p>
<p>He had never doubted this fact before, let alone investigated it.</p>
<p>Now that he had got someone to investigate it, he had finally found out that Ling Shuang had attended a boarding school for middle school, but she had never lived in a residence. She had also enrolled two years later than Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>He raised his bloodshot eyes and watched Shen Yichong holding the petite, soft Yu Yaoyao in his arms in the video. A trace of pain flashed across his face.</p>
<p>Originally, it had been him that had owned all her beauty. The way she laughed, the way she was soft and gentle, her cute way of her acting like a baby… They should all belong to him! He was the man she should be with!</p>
<p>Chen Jiao abruptly shut the computer down and picked up his phone. “Sister Li, send me Ling Shuang’s video!”</p>
<p>Only when he could watch her cry and scream in torture, could he be happy.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>After having lovely conversations with the screenwriter for several days, Yu Yaoyao finally deepened her understanding of the heroine of “Youth Without Regrets”, and she was confident that she could start acting the part.</p>
<p>The crew was informed immediately. It was originally just a youth drama, but with Guangxin’s heavy investment, funding was no longer a problem. The venue and personnel were all put in place at once.</p>
<p>The leading male actor, Qiu Dajian, who was second at the time, had been decided upon a long ago. He had a beautiful pair of dimples when he smiled.</p>
<p>During the opening ceremony, Yu Yaoyao looked at him and nodded repeatedly. “Not bad. You are suitable to play this role. You have an aura that I can control,” she said in satisfaction.</p>
<p>It seemed that screenwriting really was not easy. The artists had to be restyled from head to toe to fit the characters. Now the characters’ personalities were finally in line. She was glad she had listened to her husband. She really didn’t have the patience to write and revise a script.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian looked dumbfounded. He was just about to give an awkward but polite smile when he caught sight of the real boss standing behind her. From the crowd, Shen Yichong was staring straight at him.</p>
<p>The dimples on his face immediately stiffened. He quickly swallowed his smile. “Umm… Sis, I’m going to talk to the director! I’ll… Get going first! Control! Control what!” Mr. Shen was here! Staring at him in person!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hadn’t realized the horror she had created. When the assistant next to her gave her the signal, she stood behind the director and investors to pray and take pictures.</p>
<p>When everything was done, she got ready to run back to stand with Little Bun. Suddenly, she was stopped by a dirty beggar with a cloth bag wrapped around their body and a broken bowl in their hand.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Yu Yaoyao stopped immediately. After a moment, she touched her pocket and spread her hands in regret. “My dude, everyone uses QR code payment now. I don’t have any cash on me,” she was about to leave, when she was stopped again.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, stop!” the voice was hoarse, like a broken pot being scraped along the ground. But it also faintly revealed the original soft, delicate voice.</p>
<p>“Oh? You know me? Are you my fan too?” Yu Yaoyao opened her mouth in astonishment. “Has my reputation spread to even the street beggars?” The person opposite her was almost trembling with anger as she finished speaking, “But I still can’t help, even though you know me… After all, I can’t give you my phone. My dude, you are out of date. Go ask others for money.”</p>
<p>“You…you…you…” the beggar said as they poked her nose with a dirty finger.</p>
<p>“What now?” Yu Yaoyao immediately took a step back in disgust.</p>
<p>Originally, she had been sympathetic towards them. She herself hadn’t been self-reliant when she had lived in the zoo. She’d had to live by depending on people to feed her. So, she understood that some people had lost the ability and will to fight after being in their comfort zone for too long. But now she was getting upset that she was being repeatedly stopped.</p>
<p>Looking up, she saw Little Bun looking at her from two or three meters away. She glared at the beggar in front of her and said, “Dear beggar, I don’t look down on you. Really, I don’t. But you mustn’t look down on yourself either. Look what you’re doing now. Blocking the way for money, and you poked me when I didn’t have any. Isn’t this a little too much? Did your parents create you just so you can ask people for money? Are you proud of this?” she shook her head and sighed as she spoke.</p>
<p>The beggar was furious at her words. They opened their mouth over and over again, ready to interrupt her. “Yu Yaoyao! How dare you…”</p>
<p>“How dare I? You dare to come ask for money, but you are upset after I refuse? Gosh! I see you are full of energy as you speak, and your legs and feet are in good shape. Why not try to be self-sufficient? Find a job,” Yu Yaoyao usually educated Little Bun at home, so she was full of good reason and knowledge.</p>
<p>“You shut up! I didn’t…”</p>
<p>“Gosh! And you have a bad temper! Let me tell you what. If you’re going to beg for money with this attitude, you’ll get beaten up. It’s also not right to always rely on others and take the fruits of their labor. Think about it. Don’t you feel guilty?”</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao! I’m not a beggar!” the other party screamed and ripped off the dirty hood that was covering their face. Then, they raised their hands to wipe off the black marks on their face. “Look closely at who I am!”</p>
<p>As soon as they finished speaking, someone shouted loudly in the distance, “Group performer over there! What are you doing? We are getting started soon, get back here!”</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, two strong men ran over and dragged the beggar away, “Miss Ling Shuang. It’s starting soon. Come along,” one of them said.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao couldn’t help but feel shocked.</p>
<p>What? The beggar was Ling Shuang?</p>
