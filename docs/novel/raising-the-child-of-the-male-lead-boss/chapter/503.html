            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 260 – The Side Characters (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>A while before, when Shen Yichong was being criticized on the internet, Yu Yaoyao and Little Bun were headed to the largest local supermarket. The staff who had followed had been nervous with her unpredictability. They thought she would head straight to the destination. But she was adamant on visiting the supermarket to buy food!</p>
<p>“Mommy, aren’t we trying to save money?” asked Little Bun.</p>
<p>Of the duo, Little Bun was the sensible one, but Yu Yaoyao was fearless and spontaneous. “Don’t worry, Bun. We have a bit of money left. Since we are finally here, might as well taste the local food.” Shen Rui was more than happy for food anyway, so he agreed.</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who had been following along, handed Yu Yaoyao her ringing phone after it was approved by the staff. Ni Yi ran her through the latest developments on the internet. After he was finished, she looked at the caller ID and rolled her eyes. It was Yu Xinjie. She passed Shen Rui to Ni Yi and went to a corner to attend the call.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Yu Yaoyao put the call on speaker as she scrolled through Weibo.</p>
<p>“Sis, it’s me,” said Yu Xinjie*.</p>
<p><em>*Yu Xinjie is Yu Yaoyao’s stepsister. The person who constantly extorted money from the original YYY and manipulated her to divorce Shen Yichong.</em></p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“Have you looked at the internet?” Yu Xinjie began, “It seems there has been some misunderstanding concerning brother-in-law.”</p>
<p>“Yea, I saw.”</p>
<p>“Well, mum wants to have dinner with you when we meet next time.”</p>
<p>The conversation sounded completely normal on the surface, a talk between sisters. But Yu Yaoyao was angry with them. And she had decided that she would no longer put up with their nonsense. “Does that mean you are ready to pay back Shen’s money?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wasn’t an idiot. She knew that Yu Xinjie would never call her to show her concerns. She had called to fan the flames and somehow make the situation worse. But Yu Yaoyao would have none of it. Not anymore.</p>
<p>“Xinjie, I have read everything on the internet,” she said, “Did you call me because you felt guilty that he was slandered for living off me?”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie was speechless. Guilty? “Sis, I didn’t mean—”</p>
<p>“Back when Shen Yichong’s company was still earning, you and your mum used to borrow money all the time,” she said, bitterly, “The interests on those loans alone could cover several days’ expenses for us.” The cameraman was still filming Yu Yaoyao as she said this. “Since people have accused your brother-in-law for being useless, are you ready to pay back like a good family member to help out in difficult times?” without waiting for a response she continued, “I am so glad you are trying to make things right, Xinjie!” Yu Yaoyao was smart, she knew that she was being shot on camera to be broadcasted nationwide.</p>
<p>“Sis, I…,” Yu Xinjie realized that this had been a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>“I am sorry, Xinjie,” said Yu Yaoyao, “But I can’t talk too much. I need to find Shen Yichong. When I do, I will tell him how you have generously decided to pay him back!”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie gritted her teeth. “Sis, these misunderstandings have nothing to do with us. I was abroad for all these years….”</p>
<p>“Oh, now that you mention it,” began Yu Yaoyao, “my husband started a company at twenty-four worth over 100 million. He is not even thirty yet and we have all that we ever need, houses, cars…. He did it all by himself. Isn’t that great?”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie listened to her and had a bad feeling about what was coming up. Yu Yaoyao was undaunted, “He did everything despite loaning a huge amount of money to you and your mum which helped you to buy a house, pay for your musical academy,” she said, “You are twenty-four this year. It seems like you haven’t done much for your future, despite all the help from my husband.”</p>
<p>Xinjie was speechless and embarrassed. “Tell me Xinjie,” said Yu Yaoyao, “don’t you think it is unfair for the netizens to slander my husband’s name when he has done so much for your family?” Xinjie was shaking in rage. <em>How dare she broadcast all the family matters live?</em></p>
<p>“Sis, I was studying…,” began Xinjie.</p>
<p>“Studying? Hm,” said Yu Yaoyao, “I don’t know Xinjie. I have heard things about you. About you and the blond guy. Sis, take care and study well. Don’t get distracted alright?”</p>
