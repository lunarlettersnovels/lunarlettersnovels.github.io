        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 424</strong></p>
<p>The plot on the screen quickly continued to move forward. This husband, who was indifferent to his wife, was already having an affair with his secretary at the company. Finally, he broke out of temper and asked for a divorce in a showdown one day when Yu Yaoyao forgot to heat his meal up.</p>
<p>Following Yu Yaoyao’s expression of disbelief, there was a soft sobbing in the cinema. Women who had been housewives for a long time, or mothers who had to temporarily give up work for their children, could all understand her emotions at this moment. Having sacrificed their youth and career, the reward they got was not the value and cherishment of the man. Instead, what they got was abandonment.</p>
<p>In that instant, even tears could not flow out. The pain of betrayal had directly numbed the nerves. In the film, after Yu Yaoyao was divorced, her whole state also became weird. She began to be unorganized and even forgetful… but she had never cried.</p>
<p>It was not until she was rejected and ridiculed while applying for a job, that she cried out loud on a rainy night. She was squatting on the corner of the street, looking broken-hearted like a person with nowhere to go.</p>
<p>She only felt that she was herself when she was smoking…</p>
<p>When she was home, she could only act like a strong mother in front of her child…</p>
<p>Many women in the theater had red eyes, and even Ye Yun, who had always thought that she wouldn’t be interested in the film, took out a tissue to wipe her tears.</p>
<p>She had a fear of marriage. She had been in a relationship many times, but she hadn’t gotten married yet. She was afraid to give herself to another person and trust another person. She also hated if she had to gradually give up her career and part of her life.</p>
<p>Seeing Yu Yaoyao being rejected for an interview, Ye Yun could feel for her. As a corporate executive herself, she knew very well that the companies would not employ housewives who had spent a long time outside of the workforce, even if it was just a year, let alone the longer years. It would be very hard for housewives to return to their previous positions, especially some upper management positions. For the slightly lower and ordinary positions, they might be relatively easier.</p>
<p>The interviewer in the film made things very difficult for Yu Yaoyao’s role. She even ridiculed her experience, which aroused the anger of many women.</p>
<p>The two young girls next to Ye Yun were chattering about it.</p>
<p>“Is this person crazy? Is she on her menopause?”</p>
<p>“Is she on her period? Just say no if you don’t want to hire her. Why do you have to be sarcastic?”</p>
<p>“Why is she doing that?”</p>
<p>Ye Yun could only smile wryly after hearing this. Although it seemed unreasonable, she can probably guess the screenwriter’s thoughts on handling this character.</p>
<p>The female manager interviewer didn’t have a wedding ring on her ring finger, which indicated that she was just like herself, the group of females who would either marry late or not marry at all in order to climb up the corporate ladder. In the years when Yu Yaoyao was staying at home, they were working hard, fighting with men for positions and working overtime before they finally reached this position.</p>
<p>If Yu Yaoyao, who had been a housewife for long, still got the right to compete for the job, then what made these people who had given up their private lives and devoted themselves to work? Obviously, the female manager in the film represented the views of the extreme female, whose belief was the opposite of Yu Yaoyao.She was not mocking Yu Yaoyao, but she was insisting on her own point of view.</p>
<p>Ye Yun gritted her teeth.Her heart began to become restless.</p>
<p>She did not expect that this film that seemed to be talking about the marriage problems females face would reflect such issues. She could almost see herself from the female interviewer.</p>
<p>She had never stopped fighting for a better position.</p>
<p>Even when her parents persuaded her to get married, she procrastinated and ran away from it. She was afraid that once she got married and had children, most of her time would be taken up by her family. Then, she would no longer have the energy to compete with other colleagues, no longer had what it took to do the job, or to be appreciated by her boss.</p>
<p>Ye Yun took a deep breath and kept watching. However, her mood was completely different now. She was completely affected by the plot. She eagerly wanted to know how the screenwriter finally gave the answer.</p>
<p>Standing at the crossroads of marriage, parenting, and work, where do women go?</p>
<p>As the two-hour movie played, many young females in the theater were crying towards the end.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao and Cai Fang, the two full-time wives, were finally walking out of their family.</p>
<p>Especially Yu Yaoyao. After her divorce, she took care of her seriously ill child alone, and did almost all sorts of work that she had never done before. During the day, she was a salesperson and a waiter in a restaurant at night… In her free time, she started to recite English words and practice on her dialogue… Yu Yaoyao finally got a job as a secretary, and she even received a confession by an English teacher. Her career and love had both been reborn.</p>
<p>Cai Fang, who played her good friend, also successfully rebuilt her career and got into a new relationship. In addition to finding her value as a wife and a mother, she regained her husband’s care.</p>
<p>These two female characters were equivalent in two different directions.</p>
<p>The screenwriter did not give a clear answer even until the finale, but the bias was quite certain. That was, a woman must love herself and strive to achieve the happiness she imagined. Even if she failed, she should not give up. A chance will come.</p>
<p>At the end of the movie, the lights came on again. Ye Yun had already burst into tears.</p>
<p>She also seemed to have some clue to the question that she always had a hard time answering. Running away from the problem was just a manifestation of her cowardice and fear. A real strong woman should be like Yu Yaoyao. She should do whatever she wants to do, work hard, and finally try her best to obtain the best. There’s nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>After the show ended, Ye Yun clapped vigorously with everyone!</p>
<p>“Bravo! I’ve to let my sister see this. She can’t just prioritize my brother-in-law for everything, she still has to have her own life.”</p>
<p>“I also want to bring my mother. She can go attend college to enrich her life~”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao’s acting was so good, it made me cry a few times.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to share it with my roommates. Although it is an art film, it’s not bad~”</p>
<p>“I’ll give it a high score~”</p>
<p>Almost everyone in the theater was praising it.</p>
