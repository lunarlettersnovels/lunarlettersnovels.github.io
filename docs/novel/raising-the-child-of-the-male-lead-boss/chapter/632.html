            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 120 – A Nagging Rescuer</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s shout suddenly pulled him from his heated thoughts.</p>
<p>“Fool, why don’t you admit it! I tempt you so badly!” Her voice was soft as usual, but there was a tinge of haughtiness in it. “You don’t want to hurt me, you deny that in your malicious heart…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong chest thumped as if the line resonated with him. He looked at the enchanting woman by the lake. He then saw the man dressed in black to pause from her words, but after a second, he moved and increased his strength.</p>
<p>“Oh, has your anger turned into shame?” Yu Yaoyao’s lips stretched to a smile, akin like a Cheshire’s.</p>
<p>The next moment, she no longer resisted the other party’s forceful action, closed her eyes with her head held up high and declared,</p>
<p>“If you hit me, I’ll stand up and call you! Try harder!”</p>
<p>When the man heard this, he became flustered, his hands and feet stilling, as if he were really afraid of hurting her. But ultimately, he gritted his teeth and hit her on her right arm, pushing her right into the lake!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows instantly met at the middle, and the air conditioner on his body released twice the chilliness that the people around him couldn’t help but take a step back.</p>
<p>“Ah!” With an exclaim, Yu Yaoyao fell into the water. However, there was not a trace of panic on her face. On the contrary, she had a very strange smile on.</p>
<p>As she fell into the lake with a thud, her entire clothing was drenched, and tightly stuck to her curves. It naturally accentuated her hips, the plump peaks, her slim arms and elegant collarbones…</p>
<p>And her wet hair wrapped around her face, the water droplets dripping and  glittering translucent under the light. It was a picturesque scene of her fair complexion against her dark eyes.</p>
<p>“What are you still doing? Could it be you jest wanted to see me take a bath?” She stood in the water, speaking like a siren waiting for her prey.</p>
<p>With a delicate snort and her hair hanging down her swan-like neck, a trace of an innocent smile graced charming features, as if she was shy—a young girl in full bloom.</p>
<p>“If you wanted to see me like that… you could just have said so. Why do you need to fiercely beat me up?” She said so with a proud and unforgiving expression. Not only that, she even splashed on the water towards the man!</p>
<p><em>Splash! Splash!</em></p>
<p>The scene rang with unrestrained laughter.</p>
<p>She stretched out her hand delicately, threatening to uncover her clothes to reveal a small sneak of her shoulder. She raised her chin for the ready, exposing her long and slender neck…</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face turned from black to ash!</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>The director immediately called as well.  “Okay!”</p>
<p>Her shot was over, there was no need to do a retake or extra one!</p>
<p>The chief director’s face was extremely satisfied with this, and his eyes of praise and appreciation almost lingered on Yu Yaoyao who was still in the water.</p>
<p>After he called out, many people on the scene woke up from their dazed stupor and Yu Yaoyao’s character and held a newfound respect for the petite woman in front of the camera; many people now looked at her again with a little more admiration and acknowledgment in their eyes.</p>
<p>Her appearance is almost impeccable. But her acting skill also proved that she should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Not only did she act brilliantly on her own, but also brought a skilled stunt performer into the play. She performed her chosen plot of falling into the water, and also clearly expressed the background story and the relationship between the two characters. Such skill was not something ordinary amateur actors possess.</p>
<p>But when Yu Yaoyao heard the director say stop, her beautiful face, which was full of smiles, suddenly turned white. Her neck shrank and she shivered all over.</p>
<p>The staff immediately tried to pull her up at once, but her arms couldn’t even move… her teeth were trembling with the cold and her eyes were dazed.</p>
<p><em>Cold…</em></p>
<p>As soon as her performance as a lotus flower was over, her narcissistic excitement completely faded, and she felt the chilly, stabbing pain in her bones, flooding all her senses!</p>
<p>Snakes are cold-blooded animals. Basically, once it reaches a biting, cold temperature in winter, it goes into hibernation and the snake becomes stiff, unable to move.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt as if she was going to die; her body had gone stiff! It seemed as if the blood from her head to toe had stopped flowing. As a snake, she didn’t freeze to death in the street, but now, is she going to freeze to death as a human?</p>
<p><em>Isn’t that humiliating!?</em></p>
<p>She felt vague and confused, but then heard a splash beside her ear. Then she felt firm and strong arms tightly embrace her from behind, warming her frame.</p>
<p>A man’s smell, of hints of tobacco and grass after rain surrounded her… and from above her head, she could feel a rush of hot air! Her frozen and wet body quickly affixed to the hot man’s chest as if it were her lifeline!</p>
<p>But then a roar rang in her ears. It was a mix of anger, shortness of breath, panic and coldness—all disjointed feelings poured into one sentence.</p>
<p>“What are you still doing in the cold water!”</p>
