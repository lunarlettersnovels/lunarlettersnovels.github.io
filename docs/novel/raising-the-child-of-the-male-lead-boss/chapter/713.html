            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 38 – Doesn’t Know A Woman</strong></p>
<p>Meng Xinran secretly steals a glance at the surrounding privy eyes around the set, the corners of her mouth slightly rising. But the mischievous light in her eyes were soon suppressed, and her usual harmless and pure expression was back.</p>
<p>As soon as she heard that Wei Ming was acting with Yu Yaoyao, she daringly came out of the lounge, wanting to see her make a fool in front of an experienced actor.</p>
<p>But she didn’t expect that as soon as she came out, she only heard the director praise Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Seeing the adoring gazes of the whole crew directed at her, she was so livid that she burst into tears in a corner hidden away from the sight of the people on set.</p>
<p>These praises and admiring gazes originally belong to her!</p>
<p>But at this moment, brother Chen Jiao had surprisingly come. Mustering her courage, she gritted her teeth and manipulated the focus of public opinion on Yu Yaoyao to be on the negative side.</p>
<p><em>This woman has a stain, yet Director Li can still appreciate this kind of shameless, cheating woman? Moreover, the Guangxin entertainment boss, Shen Yichong, who is a successful and rich man—doesn’t he think about it? Does he really not doubt his wife?</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran thought maliciously and smiled as she went to pick up Yu Yaoyao, who was still lying on the bed.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, this girl is inexperienced…would you have such a gaze, only if you have experienced true love? Did you just think of the person you love the most?”</p>
<p>Everyone couldn’t help but look at the man who shined with a ‘lead actor’ aura all over his body, Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked towards the corner blocked by the surrounding crowd and found nothing unusual.</p>
<p>But she kept bracing herself as she felt a cold, murderous anger from another corner, making her skin break into goosebumps.</p>
<p>It seems that as long as her answer is wrong, she will be dead meat on the spot!</p>
<p>She looked at Meng Xinran and to the peach blossom man who seemed to be a big light bulb surrounded by moths, not so far away, and her beautiful eyes suddenly flashed in understanding.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>There is always a b*tch who wants to harm this snake! </em></p>
<p>“Of course, I always think of the person I love the most.”</p>
<p>The corner of Meng Xinran’s lips couldn’t help but lift up, slowly breaking into a wide smile at her successful scheme.</p>
<p>But in the next second, Yu Yaoyao in front of her, suddenly displayed an unhappy expression.</p>
<p>Then, as if reading a poem, she uttered words that were filled with more emotion than any of her lines she had uttered from the script before.</p>
<p>“I already miss him on the first hour I am away at home. Then I miss him again on the second hour I am away from home, then on the third, fourth, fifth…until the last hour at work that I am separated from him.”</p>
<p>Everyone stared.</p>
<p><em>Miss him when she is away from home? Is she not not thinking about Chen Jiao, the movie emperor? </em></p>
<p>Yu Yao unexpectedly had the perseverance to say she misses him the whole, eight hours of filming.</p>
<p>And then she reached out and wiped the tear at corner of her eye. “I miss him so much…I don’t know what my baby is doing at home. And I don’t know what my baby’s father is doing. Do they miss me today?”</p>
<p>As soon as she said this, she felt that the icy air that had prevailed around her body had dissipated a lot.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s peach blossom eyes looked stunned and soon the corners of his mouth tightened.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Are you the film emperor, <em>the</em> one and only Chen Jiao? Who is very handsome and is always linked to an affair with me?”</p>
<p>Yu Yao wiped away her tears, and as if she had just noticed him, her face was covered with surprise.</p>
<p>It was indeed the first time she had seen him since she had transmigrated into this world.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was stupefied, but he soon nodded politely. “Madam Shen, long time no see.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao inhaled through her nose, looking amazed. “Sure enough, only a hot meat like you deserves to be rumored in an affair with a fairy like me. Now, I can forgive the gossipmonger a little bit.”</p>
<p>When she said this, her face looked very glad as if the world had not defiled her reputation by pairing her with a handsome man.</p>
<p>“But you’re a little worse than my husband…I guess the gossipmonger, is probably a man doesn’t know much about women.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It was as if a large bowl of paste fell on his head and made Chen Jiao’s mind and thoughts stick together to a lump.</p>
<p>Isn’t this the same woman who said five years ago that she wanted to die with him and asked him to wait for her divorce?</p>
<p>The smile in his peach blossom eyes faded a little.</p>
<p>And as he was about to answer, there was another clamor from the people on set.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, holding the steamed bun, Shen Rui, finally came out from the shadow.</p>
