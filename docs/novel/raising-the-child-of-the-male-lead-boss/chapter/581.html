            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 173 – Chen Jiao’s Musings (1)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s body was trembling, seeing that unbelievable topic made her lose her sanity. The problem that had appeared on the screen inside her room was too long. Thinking about everything she’d done in her previous life; she would always watch videos on the internet and never had the opportunity to improve her lexicon. That was why she had difficulties understanding long sentences.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until she turned into a human that she became crazy and obsessed with writing and improving her understanding as an actress. Right now, her apprehension for Mandarin had regressed leaps and bounds.  However, the only thing she didn’t consider in her readings were the ancient sayings and poetry, she didn’t even have the knowledge about archaic writing that people related to it.</p>
<p>At this time, the topic for the challenge that Zhou Qiu read was a period piece, so it’s difficult for her to grasp. She frowned her eyebrows a little, puckered her lips, and stared at it for more than ten seconds. She made no further movements throughout.</p>
<p><strong>[Ha, silly! She doesn’t know how to act!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Zhou Qiu: I want to prove my innocence. Ah, I am facing a very difficult problem. Sorry!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen: Forget it, wife, let’s go home and make a second child. The world is too dangerous for you.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Yu Yaoyao was blinded by the challenge… Gosh, I laughed out loud!]</strong></p>
<p>Many people were making fun of the topic challenge and of Yu Yaoyao in the comment section. But there were also loyal YYY fans, who had been in love with her since the first episode of the show. Even though rumors about her were rife, they still hadn’t given up on cheering for her.</p>
<p>‘Come on’ and ‘Don’t be afraid’ popped up several times in the comment section… And soon, Yu Yaoyao raised her slender hand weakly in front of the live broadcast.</p>
<p>“Can I ask a question?”</p>
<p>“What kind of beverage did she drink?” she said with bitterness.</p>
<p>Last time, when the show’s production team hosted a farewell party for the contestants, she didn’t like the drink; bitter, sour, and a bit astringent, making her tongue numb. She dared to ask this question, and everyone was a little flabbergasted. But the on-site director went to ask Zhou Qiu about it.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu also thought for a while, and laughed with tears in his eyes. “What kind of beverage did she drink? All right.”</p>
<p>His answer quickly appeared on Yu Yaoyao’s board. Even the staff brought her the props such as a bottle and glass. Yu Yaoyao’s heart ached when he saw the words on the board.</p>
<p>She would drink a beverage… She looked at the bottle, with terrified eyes, grit her teeth, and poured the drink into the glass.</p>
<p>Currently, Shen Yichong’s face, who was still watching his wife, was a little heavy.</p>
<p>This challenge was very difficult to perform.</p>
<p>Not only was it necessary to perform the process of shifting from being tipsy to sober then finally to getting drunk, but it was also a painful state of drinking an intoxicating beverage. Moreover, controlling the tears in her eyes was a must, especially when the tears would fall. Falling tears indicate the most emotional moment of the character on the scene. She must be able to show her strongest feelings behind her forbearance!</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, it would still turn into a disheartened ending…</p>
<p>It could be said that this one-minute performance had high requirements for artists, and was not something that ordinary supporting artists, even veteran artists, could execute easily.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu’s voice echoed inside the auditorium; honoring the unexpectedly chosen topic for the challenge and crowning it with the highest professional difficulty rating.</p>
<p>“This is the scene, that even actors of the previous generation, whom we call veteran nowadays, were reprimanded for not expressing the right emotion, and their potentials were squeezed to its limits until they passed the director’s standard! If she can execute the challenge in the provided time… Then… not only me, but many directors will definitely cast her in their dramas.”</p>
<p>The audience was noisy and restless. But when the time given for Yu Yaoyao to prepare ended, they officially commanded her to start her performance… Soon, Yu Yaoyao finally moved but with difficulty.</p>
<p>A look of hopelessness appeared in her face; her eyes full of sadness. After a while, she shook her hands, bit her red lips, gradually closed her eyes and picked up the glass on the table. Her brows furrowed slightly, she lifted the glass and drank it off. Feeling the pain, her smooth little face wrinkled up.</p>
<p>Soon, she opened her eyes again, poured another glass of the drink, drank it. Her movement was so fast that half of the liquid in the glass was spilled on her. She lifted her slender hand and wiped her red lips with dripping liquid. Then, her lips twitched, with a trace of bitterness as if she was deprived of everything. Looking at her face, one could see the heart wrenching pain she’d been through.</p>
<p>On her third sip, she opened her eyes that turned watery, shining like a pond reflecting the starlight.  Everyone could see it… the tears in her eyes!</p>
<p><strong>[Oh, she did it!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[God, I feel like I am really watching a dramatic movie, so interesting!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This close-up shot poked my heart! Bang!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Sucks!!!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[My mama asked me why I was begging her to watch this show!]</strong></p>
<p>There was a riot in the comment section. Feedbacks, with hate and love for what they’d just witnessed, appeared. However, there was this one small account called ‘Everyone Of You Is Blind’, who left a pessimistic comment that made the YYY’s fans anxious.</p>
<p><strong>[Later, her performance will not follow the desired outcome!]</strong></p>
<p>As soon as this attention seeker basher appeared, he was immediately scolded by YYY fans. But, soon, the screen was empty because they didn’t want to miss YYY’s performance.</p>
<p>Little did they know that after drinking the beverage for the third time, her watery eyes contained a drop of crystal tear. Judging from the close-up shot, the teardrop was visible… shining brightly because of the reflection of the light from the electronic screen inside the room. The glittering tear was slowly accumulating, and finally turned out to be a transparent gemstone that seemed to break with a poke… it could clearly reflect the world in front of her.</p>
