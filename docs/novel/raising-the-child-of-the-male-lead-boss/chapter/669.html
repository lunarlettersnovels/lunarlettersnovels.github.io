            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 82 – A Steamed Bun’s Worries, Part 3</strong></p>
<p>Soon, the assistant director called everyone together and replayed everyone’s post-match footage with the judges’ comments. Everyone voted to decide which player they thought was the most dangerous.</p>
<p>It was almost five o’clock in the afternoon, when these series of events ended.</p>
<p>After the recording was finished, Yu Yaoyao waved off the photographers who followed her out, got into the nanny van, and speedily returned home. Just when the car was halfway through, Ni Yi had just wanted to joke, when he was suddenly startled by the bright red bloodstains on her sleeves!</p>
<p>He immediately turned pale in terror. “Elder sister, why is your hand bleeding! Did you get cut by the mirror?!”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inside the Shen residence…today’s episode was not a live broadcast.</p>
<p>The little steamed bun returned home from school and instantly searched for his mommy’s information as usual, but he wasn’t able to find any recent news about her. In the end, he could only regretfully watch his mommy’s short video eating potato chips from yesterday—and he watched it again and again.</p>
<p>The more he looked at it, the more the little steamed bun felt that his mommy is too pitiful.</p>
<p>Before long, his frown had already turned deep faced with the snack mama Xu had prepared for him.</p>
<p>“Mommy, do you have anything to eat now? Mommy, are you starving outside? Will mommy cry from sadness again today…?”</p>
<p>These three, abrupt questions directly made mama Xu froze. She pondered over the matter and explained to the young master as gently as possible, “Madam is working, and I’m sure that the TV station also provides packaged meals. They still get to eat at lunch, even if it’s work.”</p>
<p>“Do you think mommy won’t still be full?” The steamed bun suddenly had such a thought and become jittery.</p>
<p><em>Is there enough meat on the boxed lunch at the TV station? What if there’s no snacks in the afternoon? </em>His mind wondered about it concernedly, his gaze finally resting on the snack tray placed on the tea table.</p>
<p>It was his favorite egg roll just recently made by mama Xu. It was sweet and hot, crispy outside and soft inside. He can usually eat three large servings in one go.</p>
<p>“I won’t eat this.” The little fellow glanced wistfully at the egg rolls and slowly pushed it away, tightening his hold on the big, white snake in his arms.</p>
<p>“Just save it for mommy to eat when she comes home.”</p>
<p>As mama Xu listened, she felt a twinge of sadness. She could recall—before, everyone could see how the madam treated the young master. She was clearly a ruthless mother, even to a small child. She didn’t care for his well-being and even rejected him when he made noise.</p>
<p>But even so, the young master’s heart is still always yearning for his mother; this child was still so thoughtful, just because he wanted to obtain his mother’s affection.</p>
<p>Mama Xu’s maternal instincts kicked in, “Young Master, you can eat first. There is still a lot more in the kitchen. Even if everything gets eaten, I can still make more for the madam when she comes home.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, the madam has recently undergone a personality change and became somewhat of a mother. She probably experienced a death and understood what was the most important. After she came back from the hospital, not only did she treat her child properly this time, but the servants like them in the manor were finally treated like people.</p>
<p>Mama Xu thought of this and felt a burst of energy. The hostess’ temperaments were naturally important to domestic helpers like them.</p>
<p>“Young master, I left pudding for the madam, which is her recent favorite flavor: almond milk. You don’t have to worry, just feed your little belly, okay?” Mama Xu smiled and comfortingly touched the little guy’s head.</p>
<p>Only then did Shen Rui smile. “Yes, let’s keep the pudding for mommy. I won’t eat it, and dad can’t eat it either. Grandma Xu, you have to help me watch over mommy’s pudding.”</p>
<p>Mama Xu hurriedly agreed.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong came home from work and he saw his little son splayed on the small room with his buttocks facing him, watching how to read and write on his small tablet, he nodded with approval.</p>
<p>After washing his hands and changing his clothes, he had planned to ask his attentive son to go with him downstairs for a heart-to-heart talk between father and son. But he didn’t expect that the first instance his son saw him, he was greeted with a dejected face.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t help but crease his brows.</p>
<p>As soon as he came back, he asked mama Xu and the babysitter. He learned that his son didn’t cry today, and that he had a good time at home alone; it was a far cry from yesterday where he held the tablet and cried miserably.</p>
<p>He also browsed the internet for an announcement from ‘In the Limelight’. But the video of Yu Yaoyao’s filming for today was not to be released until a few days later. On the way home, Shen Yichong had also scoured the internet to confirm that Yu Yaoyao has not provoked any new moths for today.</p>
<p>“Shen Rui is not in a good mood today?”</p>
<p>The steamed bun lowered the small tablet in his hand and forlornly picked up the big, white snake again.</p>
<p>His tone sounded somewhat depressed, “Dad, I heard footsteps and I thought mommy was back home.”</p>
