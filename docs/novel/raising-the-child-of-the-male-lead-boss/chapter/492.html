            <p><strong>Chapter 271 – The Cave of the Silken Web | 19</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Technically, the couple had to limit their expenses to the funds that had been allocated to them in the beginning. Director Zhao, although feeling fifty years older than he actually was because of the stress this particular couple had given him, decided to be lenient. After all, Yu Yaoyao and Shen Yichong had given them a unique show with all their scheming. Director Zhao admired them both.</p>
<p>“We are continuing the livestream till the end,” reminded Director Zhao, “There is still forty hours left. So, the cameramen will be following you even in your hotel rooms for the duration of that time.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao thanked the Director and proceeded to leave to enjoy their seafood meals by the sea. Yu Yaoyao relished the much-awaited food while Shen Rui stuffed his face full of everything that was on the table. They ate so much that Shen Rui was almost dozing off. By the time they headed back to their hotel room, which was booked by the program team, Shen Rui was fast asleep and drooling in Yu Yaoyao’s arms.</p>
<p>Seeing Shen Rui sleeping soundly, the fans in the comment sections expressed some indecent ideas:</p>
<p><strong>【Ohhh! The baby is sleeping. Are Mr. Shen and Y going to do some hmhmhm things? 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Mr. Shen will definitely not work overtime today, I think! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Is the livestream clapping for love? Dang! I’m suddenly abnormally awake! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【As soon as the kids sleep, it is the world of adults! Hurry into the hotel room! I want to watch! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【I will drop a like for the program’s forty-eight-hour livestream. Hehehehehe~ I’m not sleeping tonight. I’m going to watch it all! I won’t miss a single minute! 】</strong></p>
<p>The number of viewers on the livestream hadn’t diminished even by a pinch. The couple had garnered some massive followings who were enthralled by their relationship. The moonlit night, a meal by the sea, and their walk across the vast sandy beach under the starry skies had given the fans even more fuel.</p>
<p>When the trio finally reached the hotel room and Shen Yichong opened the door, the fan following was privy to the room decorated with dim lights. The walls of the room were covered with golden lights. Some of them circled the bed. A chair hung in the middle of the room by gold threads that moved with the slightest touch. Many fans praised the program team for decorating the room and setting a romantic atmosphere. The room also had gold threads through the walls to the ceilings. They were everywhere the eyes could see.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on entering the room, leaped up excitedly on the soft bed. She reached for a pillow and rolled around in the bed contentedly. “What are these golden wires for?” asked Yu Yaoyao, looking around the small room. She straightened her long legs and had her toes stuck on the wires.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had taken off his trench coat and headed to the bathroom to wash up. As he came out, he saw Yu Yaoyao with her feet high on the wall. He looked at her for a moment longer. “Didn’t you see the label on the door?” he asked, placing the hand towel on the back of a chair.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blinked. “No,” she replied. He walked over and untangled her feet from the wires. Seeing her like this was making his heart beat faster.</p>
<p>“‘<em>The Cave of the Silken Web</em>’,” he said hoarsely, “That was written on the door.”</p>
<p>“I know about <em>The Cave of the Silken Web</em>!” said Yu Yaoyao excitedly, “It’s where the spider spirit lives!” She could see that the golden wires enclosed the room like a spider cocooning its prey. She got up and wrapped her arms around Shen Yichong’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“Do you know where the most beautiful snake spirit lives?” she asked mischievously.</p>
<p>“I don’t know…,” he said, blushing entirely red. He tried to loosen her arms from around his shoulders.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her beautiful, delicate face to look at him. She looked simply enchanting holding on to him. She raised a hand and placed her thin, elegant forefinger on his chin. Her fingers trailed from his chin to his throat, over his Adam’s apple and slowly towards his chest. “Here,” she said, placing her palm on his heart.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s heart was beating so loudly. He grasped the small hand on his chest and clutched it. As the fans viewing this scene went wild, the livestream went dark. Shen Yichong had scooped up his trench coat and flung it at the camera, which now covered it completely.</p>
<p>The sudden darkness in the live broadcast made the viewers even more thrilled. All they heard was Yu Yaoyao saying ‘hubby’, which added to the frenzy. The reality, however, was quite different from the fantasies of the fans but no less passionate. Shen Yichong had lifted Yu Yaoyao in his arms and carried her to the bathroom. She was so surprised that she had wrapped her legs around his waist. His breath grew quicker.</p>
<p>He lowered his head and tore off the microphone attached to Yu Yaoyao’s collar. He carried her to the bathroom as the microphone tumbled down to the ground. He placed her over the sink in the bathroom; her legs still wrapped around his waist. Both their hearts were thundering.</p>
<p>He lowered his head and kissed her. Yu Yaoyao felt as though the strings holding her mind together snapped. At that instant, she understood the function of the dangling chair in the room outside. However, as she turned her head up to look at him, he had taken his phone out of the pocket and was shutting it down. “There will be no interruption today,” he said. Yu Yaoyao smiled, and she reached a hand to get a hold of his collar. She pulled him close to plant a passionate kiss on his chin, his cheek, and finally his lips. She licked the side of his ears, sending tremors throughout his body. Beads of sweat lined his forehead.</p>
<p>“I need to tell you something,” whispered Yu Yaoyao, in his ears, “I am actually a spirit.” Her soft voice coursed through him like poison in his veins. He couldn’t take it anymore. Her sweet voice broke his rationality as he reached to tear off her overalls. He grabbed her hands and pinned them over her head. He looked at her flushed, intoxicating face and found it irresistible. He leaned down and sealed her lips with his.</p>
<p>“Don’t say anything,” he said hoarsely, “Close your eyes….”</p>
