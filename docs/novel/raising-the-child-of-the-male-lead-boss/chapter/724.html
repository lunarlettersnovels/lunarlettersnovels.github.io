            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 27 – You Can’t Afford A Vase</strong></p>
<p>The crew was filled with complex emotions and their eyes constantly flitted between the two of them, making Meng Xinran, who was in front of the camera, become embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, go change your clothes!” Director Li Bo, who saw his stunned crew, was still furious as he dropped the script in his hand.</p>
<p>“Makeup artist! Did you come here to be incompetent? If you don’t want to work, you can just stand there in a daze! Do you think you’re a <sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>vase?!”</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to do it, then get out of here!” He continued.</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who was behind Yu Yaoyao, suddenly turned pale. The director was obviously scolding them indirectly; they’ve just entered the set and they were already sprinkled with a torrent of abuse!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the whole cast and crew were only looking in jest.</p>
<p>“Sister, let’s go and put your make up” Ni Yi wiped his sweat, and quickly took Yu Yaoyao to the interior.</p>
<p>Five years ago, she was stuffed into director Li Bo’s cast, and her acting had become the biggest scandal in showbiz. He always had cruel remarks, but this did not faze the current Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>She was once a majestic snake spirit and had never been once trampled once.</p>
<p>Before entering the zoo, she was already a big sister in the wild! She flew in the sky, slithered on the rocky ground, and swam on treacherous waters; as long as someone dares to confront her, she would definitely swallow them in minutes!</p>
<p>At this moment, Yu Yaoyao looked at the makeup artist girl who was rushing out and was about to cry.</p>
<p>She could not help but pull up the little girl’s hand into her own and say, “Do you know how much the most expensive vase in history is?”</p>
<p>The makeup artist girl was bewildered and shook her head in a hurry.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao took out her mobile phone and typed something. She then looked around at the audience and opened her lips. “7 million USD.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s mouth twitched. “Sister …”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled and patted the makeup artist’s hand and tsked, “Men are like this. They say they don’t want vases, but their actions should be more honest. Ah, a 7 million vase … we should work hard—even more for those small flowers.”</p>
<p>The whole crew almost immediately turned their heads and looked at the ground, laughing at this blatant ridicule.</p>
<p><i>She is really shameless! They could only think.</i></p>
<p>The sweet smile on female no. 1 Meng Xinyu in front of the camera turned stiff.</p>
<p>Who doesn’t know that from her site traffic she is branded as a small flower in the net, and here comes Yu Yaoyao casually speaking that she was no good. For this married aunt, how beautiful was she, to secretly dare love Chen Hao and also humiliate her?</p>
<p>“Older sister Yu,” Meng Xinyi tried to suppress her ugly emotions, and reluctantly lifted the corners of her mouth to a small smile, “This is the first time we have met; I’m asking Sister to give me some advice. We are all artists from Guangxin Company. Only, Sister Yu Yaoyao debuted earlier.”</p>
<p>She greeted meekly, trying to lower her position so that the crew would fight on her behalf.</p>
<p>After all, Yu Yaoyao was only known for her disastrous acting skills, stupidity, and infamous scandal in the acting industry for not memorizing her lines! What qualifications did she have to say that the small flower Mengxin needed more dedication and work? And to label men—especially to say all those who were present had no brains and that they only looked at the outward appearance of a woman?</p>
<p>The crew suddenly became resentful!</p>
<p><i>What is the use of being beautiful when the mouth is poisonous and impolite? Moreover, she only takes advantage of her husband’s position as the boss to do whatever she wants!</i></p>
<p>At this time, the looks thrown at Yu Yaoyao way were full of scorn and enmity.</p>
<p>Director Li Bo, who was the center of this public criticism, couldn’t help but have a sinister expression on his face. “Yu Yaoyao, in a while we’ll immediately start shooting your 184th scene!”</p>
<p>The 184th scene was where her character, He Ling, was bitten by poisonous snakes planted by a palace eunuch on her bed!</p>
<p>Ni Yi had read this part of the script before, and he was really worried about this scene. He had also communicated with the props group, hoping they would replace the real live snakes planned for this scene with toy snakes.</p>
<p>But now … Director Li Bo suddenly mentioned this scene and his heart unconsciously beat faster in fear.</p>
<p>Sure enough, as soon as his sight fell on the props group, he saw a bamboo cage towards the side where two snakes were crawling and twisted together inside it. Ni Yi was sweating like rain and in an instant, his face became white as a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Even if he was a grown-up, he was still afraid—how much more Yu Yaoyao?</p>
