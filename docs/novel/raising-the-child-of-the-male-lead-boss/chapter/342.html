            <p><strong>Chapter 421</strong></p>
<p>Xu Hong looked like he was dead inside.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s words clearly meant that he found that the data had been modified. Xu Hong already knew before that it wouldn’t be so easy to fool Shen Yichong, but in any case, he did not expect his actions to be discovered so soon.</p>
<p>“You leaked the company’s trade secret more than once,” Shen Yichong began, “You, as a staff in the Investment Department, have made huge mistakes with the data more than once. Go to the HR department yourself. After the handover is complete, wait for the company’s notice of punishment.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong asked him to leave after he dropped the last few words..</p>
<p>Xu Hong was covered in cold sweat. He knew that it was a game over for him.</p>
<p>He had been unable to satisfy Shen Yichong for the past two years, which was why he did a lot of things to protect himself, hoping to find a way out.</p>
<p>In terms of leaking out the company’s trade secret, he was required to bear the responsibility for breach of contract, according to the employment contract at the time. The punishment might be linked to the investment income, which meant that it was very likely that he would be bankrupt!</p>
<p>“Boss, I didn’t…” Xu Hong clutched the table in the conference room tightly. “I really didn’t.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at him coldly, “Of course there’ll be people from the technical department who will investigate. You can go argue with them.”</p>
<p>Xu Hong collapsed on the chair suddenly. He no longer had the strength to struggle.</p>
<p>People could always find clues if they wanted to verify. The history in his laptop and the CCTV footage could all be evidence.</p>
<p>Xu Hong raised his face, and he found that many shareholders and department heads in the meeting room were looking at him strangely with a shocked and obvious gossiping look.</p>
<p>His face suddenly turned into the color of pig liver. He’s done! The scandal of him leaking the company’s trade secret would soon spread in the industry, and no company in the industry will ever want to hire him!</p>
<p>Xu Hong hurried away before Chen Lin had the security guard to take him away. He had no more courage to speak, and he did not dare to let Shen Yichong continue to speak.</p>
<p>After leaving the meeting room, he collapsed on the sofa seat outside. Trembling, he called Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>“Brother Jiao, Shen Yichong found out about me leaking the company’s trade secrets . I…I can only rely on you now.”</p>
<p>Xu Hong sweated profusely.</p>
<p>“Brother Jiao, I can help you analyze investments in the future. Several projects I looked at this year also made money. I also know many producers in the industry. If you want to invest and make money, I can definitely help you.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao remained silent after hearing this.</p>
<p>After a while, he finally replied, “Did you misunderstand something? I’m just an actor.”</p>
<p>Xu Hong was taken aback. He fell into complete panic.</p>
<p>“Brother Jiao, you promised before that as long as I provide you with information, you’ll not forget me when there’s any benefit you got in return. This is just an accident. You also know that Shen Yichong and the production director are friends! Maybe they have been negotiating for a long time. Shen Yichong is determined to invest!”</p>
<p>“Benefits? Did you forget how much money I lost because of your news?” Chen Jiao’s voice was indifferent. “What benefit can I give you now? How much money did you make for me? Mr. Xu, did you misunderstand anything?”</p>
<p>Xu Hong collapsed completely. His legs went so soft that he couldn’t even stand up!</p>
<p>This was not at all what Chen Jiao promised.</p>
<p>He said that his studio had just been established, and it was at a phase of expansion. He said he needed to absorb new people and invest heavily in it. He also said it was very important to have an experienced old man who could look out for him!</p>
<p>All these persuaded him to take the risk. He betrayed Shen Yichong repeatedly, only hoping to be able to grab this back-up tightly!</p>
<p>Who knew…?</p>
<p>A beeping busy tone sounded in Xu Hong’s ear. Chen Jiao had obviously hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Xu Hong’s face was pale as he finally understood the situation. All Chen Jiao wanted was someone in Guangxin who could pass information to him, and he had never even cared what ability Xu Hong had! Since he was dismissed by Guangxin, he no longer carried any value in Chen Jiao’s eyes. He was now just an abandoned man!</p>
<p>Xu Hong completely understood the situation.</p>
<p>It was really stupid for him to have believed in Chen Jiao before! He really regretted his choice! When Chen Jiao chose to leave Guangxin, it showed that he was a person who only cared for his best interest!</p>
<p>There was nothing wrong with the comments on the Internet that talked about his characteristics.</p>
<p>Xu Hong felt extremely regretful! But he can’t go back in time. It was already too late!</p>
<p>Losing all his energy, he dragged his feet and walked out of the building with a wry smile.</p>
<p>The next day, Guangxin’s official Weibo page released a pinned-on-top news.</p>
<p><em>[Guangxin will be investing 500 million Yuan for the film ‘The Cat and I’ produced by Da Fu. This was a cute pet theme that took a heartwarming route, and it would be a production under Digital Empire, a special effects company under Guangxin Entertainment.</em></p>
<p><em>Not only that, but this movie also wanted to spark ideas about the image of the cat from any cute and spiritual cat pets across the country. Everyone is welcomed to send their pet’s photos, short videos, and resumes to participate in the selection of the cat role.</em></p>
<p><em>The event would last until the end of October.]</em></p>
