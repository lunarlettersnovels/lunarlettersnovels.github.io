            <p><strong>Chapter 456</strong></p>
<p>“Hello, Xiao Rui.” Chen Lin stretched out his hand to touch the dinosaur horn with a smile before changing his shoes.</p>
<p>Ye Yun, who followed behind, saw him touching Little Bun and couldn’t help but feel itchy in her heart.</p>
<p>“Hello…Little Bun…”</p>
<p>Her voice trembled a little. She couldn’t help but feel like touching it! There was almost an uncontrollable scream in her heart, but she was still trying her best to endure it. It was only the first time they had met, and it would be so rude if she touched Little Bun.</p>
<p>Hold back. She must hold back!</p>
<p>“Auntie, do you like dinosaur pyjamas too?” Shen Rui raised his head.</p>
<p>As soon as he looked at Ye Yun, he found that her eyes that were looking at his dinosaur horn seemed to be full of endless longing and yearning. She looked so pitiful.</p>
<p>Did she feel embarrassed to wear it because she was no longer young?</p>
<p>“Well… Auntie, you may touch the dinosaur tail.” Little Bun dragged the long tail behind his butt to the front and asked Ye Yun to touch it. “There is a brand label on it. You can search where to buy it~”</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s face turned red! It was neither from nervousness or excitement, but from the adrenaline rush due to Little Bun’s cuteness! He turned his head, dragged his tender tail, and shook it twice in the air. Then, he asked her to touch…! Yes. She got to touch Little Bun’s soft tail!</p>
<p>The corners of Ye Yun’s mouth rose, revealing a suspicious smile. Looking down, she saw Little Bun’s little fluffy belly. How she wished she could hug Little Bun and touch his little belly!</p>
<p>Her expression got even weirder. Little Bun looked up at her and was amazed. Her look was a little like the way his mommy looked when she was coquettish with her dad and wanted to eat more pudding.</p>
<p>“Xiao Rui, where is your mommy? Is she resting?” Chen Lin interrupted them and asked a question.</p>
<p>Shen Rui immediately raised his head and pointed to the second floor, “Mummy is doing yoga on the second floor. Uncle Chen Lin, are you here to meet Mommy? I can go call her.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay. I can wait for her to finish. I’m not in a hurry. I have time today.” Ye Yun spoke immediately. “For yoga, you have to do a complete set for it to be effective. You can’t disrupt the rhythm!”</p>
<p>Yaoyao needed to restore her prenatal figure as soon as possible so she could come back faster. They must absolutely not disturb her!</p>
<p>After Ye Yun said that, she immediately looked at Chen Lin pleadingly, “Sir, why don’t you go back first? I’ll wait here?”</p>
<p>Chen Lin finally knew the difference between fans and non-fans. “Alright. Then I’ll send a message to our lady boss, so she knows about you,” he complied.</p>
<p>After leaving the message, he explained his intention to Little Bun once again. Then, he left Ye Yun behind and hurriedly returned to the company.</p>
<p>While Ye Yun was waiting, she sat on the sofa in the living room and kept on drinking water and looked at the magazine in front of her. She didn’t dare to look around at will, for fear of infringing on the idol’s privacy. During the whole time, Little Bun also sat on the sofa and accompanied her. The housekeeper and maid were also accompanying them from far away.</p>
<p>Ye Yun would peek at Little Bun every once in a while, as she glanced at the magazine.</p>
<p>It was the real Little Bun! A real Little Bun that was attending an online school! It was neither for a show, nor was it a character that was set up deliberately. Little Bun really took the initiative to listen to the lessons…</p>
<p>Ye Yun tried her best to perk up her ears and listen intently. She was soon startled. He was listening to the Math Olympiad? This Little Bun was really impressive! And he was only five years old…</p>
<p>Feeling shocked, she picked up the teacup and took a huge sip! Fifteen minutes later, Ye Yun realized that she had finished drinking the glass of water and needed to go to the toilet!</p>
<p>“Erm…” Ye Yun stood up red-faced.</p>
<p>Little Bun, who was paying serious attention to his class, looked over curiously. Ye Yun swallowed her saliva. <em>‘I’m sorry to disturb your class,’</em> she thought apologetically.</p>
<p>“May I know where the bathroom is?”</p>
<p>Little Bun nodded, indicating that he understood. He put down the tablet and made a gentlemanly gesture of invitation, “Auntie, please come with me.” Since daddy was not here, and mommy was busy, he had to be the one in-charge to take care of their guest.</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s chest thumped. After following Little Bun around, they finally stopped at the door of the bathroom on the first floor. Two green snakes that were hovering in the glass box next to them looked at her with their small heads raised.</p>
<p>Ye Yun took a deep breath. It was the prop snakes used in the ‘Queen of Flourishing Age’! There were people on Weibo that once said Yaoyao had taken the snakes home to raise them. She had always thought that was just a joke, but it turned out to be true!</p>
<p>The snake cage was even very advanced. There were also thermometers and moisture recorders in the glass box, which were obviously thermostatically controlled. There were also small rockeries, stones, small water bowls… a simulated ecological environment! It seemed that they were well taken care of, and they were not just raised without any attention given.</p>
<p>“Auntie, this is Daqing and Xiaoqing,” the Little Bun said. “Hey, you guys should also say hello to Auntie!”</p>
<p>Through the glass, Little Bun touched the snake’s head. Ye Yun was already gulping.  Soon, another soft and beautiful voice came from upstairs.</p>
<p>“Oh, are you Xiao Yunyun?”</p>
<p><em>Xiao Yunyun?! </em>Ye Yun’s heart trembled.</p>
<p>When she looked up, she saw Yaoyao wearing the same pink dinosaur suit as Little Bun. Yaoyao who just finished yoga seemed like a big bun that had just come out of the oven. Ye Yun clutched her chest, feeling that her heart was about to jump out.</p>
