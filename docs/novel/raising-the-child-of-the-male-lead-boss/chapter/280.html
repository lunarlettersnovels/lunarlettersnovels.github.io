            <p><strong>Chapter 483</strong></p>
<p>This episode almost came to an end. But Fang Qiuye was successful in seeing Little Sweetheart. Little sweetheart with a tender face and a pair of round eyes, who spit bubbles and stretched out her hand towards her. The little baby was wearing a pink butterfly jumpsuit, and her little feet were covered in socks with a kitten paw design. Her whole look was cute, girly and soft.</p>
<p>There was nothing to describe the extreme bliss Fang Qiuye felt at the moment.</p>
<p>She, who had never written about children before, was suddenly struck with the idea of her female and male leads’ have a cute daughter. The baby could even look like the heroine. She felt happy just by imagining it and wished she could go home now and write down the plot.</p>
<p>‘First scene: the couple banging; then, the female lead gets pregnant and gives birth to a baby!’ she thought blissfully.</p>
<p>However, Fang Qiuye could feel a certain chillness in the room as soon as Mr. Shen stepped inside. It was time to call it a day. Work was calling back at home; Yaoyao and Mr. Shen would also want to spend more time with their babies and with each other. She was a third wheel for most of the day.</p>
<p>“I shall get going.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye solemnly bid farewell, and she didn’t care whether the crew had shot enough footage. To her, Yaoyao’s every movement was a film in itself, and it could be broadcasted directly without editing.</p>
<p>Before leaving, she confessed to Yaoyao, her face flushing in embarrassment, “I’m sorry, but I actually got someone to help. My English-”</p>
<p>“No, Big Head,” Yaoyao quickly cut her off with a shake of her head. “No need to say sorry. I learned a lot today, and I am very happy to meet you. Thank you for spending so much time with me.” Yu Yaoyao hugged her arm without hesitation. “How will I spend the long days? Study is so boring, and you are the only one here who can talk about novels with me.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s face turned redder and her heart beat faster. As a shy, anxious person, she usually couldn’t communicate well when meeting strangers for the first time. However, she didn’t have such difficulties today. It felt like Yaoyao and her had known each other for a long time. They were like friends who would discuss plots, share book lists, and complain together about some sucky endings written by authors.</p>
<p>“In the future, you can come visit whenever you’re free,” Yu Yaoyao said. “Big Head, it’s not good that your English isn’t great. We can study together. You can also invite your teacher here so we can learn together. Today, we haven’t even finished translating the first chapter.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed with regret. “We still have a long way to go. I don’t think Dacheng can finish her stories within two hundred chapters…” she continued. “Even if we do half a chapter every day, it will take us a year to translate… that’s life!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was dripping with sweat. Yaoyao still wanted to do that? Then… should she go home and start editing from the first chapter?! If Teacher Gong were to read the entire novel… he would possibly become a tutor turned murderer!</p>
<p>“Big head, you can go home by the staff’s car. Let me know when you get home safely,” Yaoyao said. “At nine o’clock tonight, we can read the latest chapter from Dacheng and discuss the plot~”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was immediately stressed. She shouldn’t write nonsense anymore! Otherwise, Yaoyao would criticize her like mad!</p>
<p>While Fang Qiuye was heading home, trembling, Yu Yaoyao carefully reviewed the key points and words she learned today in the living room. She read it a few times and recited it. After these few scenes were recorded, Zhao Yu announced that they should end the shooting here.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, shall we change the theme for the next episode?” Director Zhao wiped his sweat. Otherwise, at this rate the show would be banned.</p>
<p>“Director Zhao, you got sick of this so quickly? Fine, I’ll think about it.” After Yu Yaoyao finished her study, she stretched out and took a bite of the watermelon Shen Yichong prepared.</p>
<p>Director Zhao: “…”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fang Qiuye turned on the computer right after she got home, and took out the notebook from her small bag. When she was on her way back just now, she was already drafting for the next chapters. Now, she only had to place both her hands on the keyboard. She didn’t even care about having dinner. She would not get out of the room unless she had typed 10,000 words!</p>
<p>While she was burning in passion, her roommate, Xiaoqiao, trotted over. Fang Qiuye shared the rent with her. Coincidentally, her roommate was also a full-time author. They started living together half a year ago, and they would always discuss topics on writing and exchange plot ideas.</p>
<p>Besides being roommates, they have been close friends. Xiaoqiao’s works had always performed better than hers. However, Xiaoqiao was a typical night owl. She usually slept during the day, just barely got up in the afternoon to eat a meal and wouldn’t start writing until the evening. She also never went to bed before it was almost dawn.</p>
<p>It was only five o’clock in the afternoon, and it should still be her sleep time.</p>
<p>“Oh ho! Are you hungry? Why did you get out of your hole early?” her roommate said.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye didn’t even bother to turn her head back. Her hands were flying over the keyboard as if possessed. “I’m rushing for an update today. Order takeout directly for dinner!” After she finished speaking, there was still no reply from the person behind her.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye finally looked back after entering all the words she had in her head, “Xiaoqiao, what’s wrong? Are you writing a horror story? Don’t stand behind me without speaking!”</p>
<p>When she turned around, she saw Xiaoqiao’s expression. She wasn’t sure if it was an expression of surprise, joy or excitement.</p>
<p>“What? Did you win the lottery?” Fan Qiuye said. “Are your works on the list of recommendations? Could it be that you sold your rights to a film and television company?”</p>
<p>If an author was overjoyed, it must be due to one of these. But in the next second, Fang Qiuye was being hugged.</p>
