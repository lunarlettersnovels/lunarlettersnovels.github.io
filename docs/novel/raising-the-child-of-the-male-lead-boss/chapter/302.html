            <p><strong>Chapter 461</strong></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye couldn’t believe what she just saw.</p>
<p>She had known Ye Yun for awhile. After becoming a YY fan, Fang Qiuye would later become the fan club president and gradually became acquainted with Ye Yun, the current vice president.</p>
<p>Although Ye Yun was four or five years older than her, their personalities were pretty alike. After a long period of mutual exchanges regarding the fan club, they naturally became friends in private. Later, she found out that the both of them were in the same city. They even hung out before to watch a movie and have dinner together.</p>
<p>Usually, they would share photos of Yu Yaoyao to each other. They were not just fans of Yu Yaoyao, but they also adored Little Bun very much. And since they were both office workers, they admired Mr. Shen’s working prowess immensely.</p>
<p>Simply put, they were devoted fans of Yaoyao’s family, and they loved watching the sweet and interesting interactions of their family. If they were to sort them sequentially, Yaoyao would be ranked the first, and Little Bun would be the second. Mr. Shen was ranked third, simply because they appreciated his talent.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye screamed three times at the door after she saw Shen Yichong before recovering her wits.</p>
<p>“I…I’m on TV?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Ye Yun, who was watching the whole live broadcast, almost suffocated from holding back her laughter. It was live!</p>
<p>The program team was also very thoughtful. Since Fang Qiuye was an amateur, they didn’t directly shoot her face. Instead, they politely brought the camera closer and focused on her hands.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to appear on TV, it will be edited out later.” The program assistant who was following Mr. Shen immediately explained. “But because we’re on live broadcast now, your voice might be heard by everyone. If you’d like, we’ll leave now.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye looked at the talking staff. Then, she looked at the tall Mr. Shen who was standing in front of her. All of a sudden, she stamped her feet excitedly.</p>
<p>“No, it’s okay!” she said. “Come in and sit, the weather is hot, come in and drink some tea before you leave!”</p>
<p>The staff almost laughed. Autumn had long passed. However, Fang Qiuye stuck her head out and looked at the entrance of the corridor outside.</p>
<p>“Teacher Yu is cooking at home, so she couldn’t come.” The staff knew at a glance who she was looking for.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye sighed in disappointment.<em> ‘Oh, what a pity.’</em></p>
<p>But she was resurrected soon. After all, the food in her hands was made by Yu Yaoyao! It was packed by Little Bun and sent by Mr. Shen!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye wanted nothing more than to give Ye Yun a kiss through the phone! This sister of hers was so nice to share insider information with her. No wonder she told her yesterday that she should install and update all her food delivery apps.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she listened to Ye Yun.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your invitation, but I should leave when the things are delivered. I have nine more orders to be delivered today,” Mr. Shen said. He had no intention of entering the house.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye put her takeaway on the table. Her roommate, secretly peeking from her room, also had her mouth open in shock.</p>
<p>Although Fang Qiuye felt a little regretful to hear that Mr. Shen was leaving, she nodded to him. ”Okay. Good luck, Mr. Shen. Thank you, Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>“You’ve worked hard.” She insisted on passing an unopened bottle of mineral water to Shen Yichong. “Although it’s not Evian, it’s also spring water that tastes sweet. I hope you enjoy it, Mr. Shen,” she smiled. “You can have it on your way.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was speechless. Yu Yaoyao’s fans were indeed different. He thanked her and quickly left with a blank face, as if someone was chasing him from behind.</p>
<p>But such a cold appearance did not make Fang Qiuye feel depressed. On the contrary, when some audience in the live broadcast room tried to criticize Shen Yichong for his bad attitude, Fang Qiuye stood up and refuted without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>[Gentle temper: This is called keeping a polite distance from the opposite sex. Do you people even know this! This is what a husband who loves his wife should do!]</strong></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye didn’t lie at all. Just now, the more indifferent Shen Yichong was to her, the happier she felt in her heart.</p>
<p>This was a good husband. If Mr. Shen were to become too amicable with people everywhere, he would definitely attract a large group of females, which would also form a threat to Yaoyao.</p>
<p><em>‘He did great.’ </em>Fang Qiuye happily thought, and gave Shen Yichong a thumbs up in her head.</p>
