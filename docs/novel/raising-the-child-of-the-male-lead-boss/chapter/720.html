            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 31 – Meng Xinran The Snake</strong></p>
<p>Director Li was shell-shocked looking at the picture and couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Now that he noticed this, he held newfound respect for her.</p>
<p>But…how can this snake brought today be so obedient that after it bit down, it did not harm her in the slightest and was even coincidental with the script?</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao half-slouched against the bed, slowly stretching out her black hair. A seductive glamour was present in her current appearance and when she pursed her red lips, she held the charm of a wicked enchantress.</p>
<p>The surrounding crew who stared at her could not help but tremble.</p>
<p>Her stunning looks are truly tailor-made for the role of a seductive showgirl, He Ling.</p>
<p>She was able to stand out from a number of girls, with the emperor falling head over heels for her at first sight. This caused the envy of the 3,000 other beauties in the emperor’s harem. Noble imperial consorts then planned to have her killed. With this, the actress portraying the role of He Ling must be extremely beautiful so that the audience would be moved.</p>
<p>Only with a beauty like Yu Yaoyao is truly perfect to portray this He Ling.  With other ordinary actresses, it wouldn’t be as convincing.</p>
<p><em>Moreover, has her acting skills improved? </em>The crew was drowned in contemplation.</p>
<p>Directer Li naturally understands the thoughts of everyone, and he can’t help but look at her intricately. “Good.”</p>
<p>He cherished this compliment like gold, but halfway he added four more words, “It was very good.”</p>
<p>The people who had bet their 100, 150 and only remaining money were instantly slapped in the face with this remark from the director.</p>
<p><em>A single take! And she acted to the end of the script!</em></p>
<p>Even Meng Xinran said that it would take her five times.</p>
<p>They couldn’t help but look at the small flower of the internet.</p>
<p><em>Is a vase really stronger than the small flower?</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran noticed everyone’s complicated looks at her and her teeth hurt from her gritting.</p>
<p>She looked at Yu Yaoyao again, and her hands could not help but clench. <em>Losing to a scum that hasn’t been in the acting scene for five years? Never!</em></p>
<p>“Yu older sister, are you okay?” Meng Xinran walked towards the cot with a look of concern and even pushed the anxious Ni Yi to the side. “Was my older sister very scared?”</p>
<p>When everyone heard it, the admiration in their eyes suddenly faded.</p>
<p><em>Yes, it was not acting but real fear that help push her through! </em>Yu Yaoyao was truly afraid to death the moment the snake bit her and had no option but to pass out in the end!</p>
<p>“I truly admire older sister for being able to act to the end of the scene, even in a state of fear. Let me help older sister go back to the lounge and let’s drink some hot water.” Meng Xinran’s face took an even more worried expression.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao chuckled.</p>
<p>She used to stare at visitors who came and went, so she knew more about human facades than anyone else. Now, she could see at a glance how fake this expression is and how her eyes looked meaningful!</p>
<p>But she did not refuse, and instead took Meng Xinran’s hand to prop most of her body weight on her. She gracefully got out of bed like a queen being attended by her handmaiden and wore the red wool shawl handed by Ni Yi. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>She turned to Ni Yi and loudly said, “Ah, yes little Yiyi—the snakes were very good. Remember to buy them later.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was stunned, <em>‘…She still hasn’t forgotten about the matter yet?</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran almost lost her footing when she heard this, but she couldn’t loosen her hold on Yu Yaoyao. “What did older sister Yu say?! Haha! You’re funny!”</p>
<p>Director Li’s eyes were fixed on the monitor.</p>
<p><em>Was she truly afraid of the snake? </em>Yet why does he feel as if Yu Yaoyao held no fear at all?</p>
<p>Currently, her breathing is completely different from that of a person who was just recently frightened. People with no acting skills and only fell into a state of fear wouldn’t be able to adjust their mood so quickly…</p>
<p>His mind was only in chaos after the shoot.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao went inside the lounge for her break.</p>
<p>She took off her footwear and comfortably leaned back on the recliner. Listening to Ni Yi’s continued recitation of the script, it was like a lullaby making her eyes droop.</p>
<p><em>Afraid of snakes? Such a thing doesn’t exist. </em>These snakes’ generation is at the very least the grandson of her grandchildren…generations!</p>
<p>The young ones were so obedient, how could she be afraid?</p>
<p>And as for acting being bitten by a snake, she naturally has no experience. But with the number of movies and TV shows she has watched, the numerous passersby going to and fro the zoo when she was bored—studying expressions for so long, how can she not learn a great deal?</p>
<p>Moreover, when it comes to fear, she fully understood it when she went on the roller coaster. Thinking of the height loss and sudden asphyxiation, her face became pale, and it was difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>All this made it possible for her to act without a hitch!</p>
<p>“Little Yiyi, I want to watch a Korean drama TV drama and eat sweet strawberries. By the way, get those two little snakes and let me play with them for a while. Let me chat with them—waiting is boring.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “…”</p>
