            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 6 – Must Make Her Beautiful (3)</strong></p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao woke up again, she was already in the hospital. When she had transmigrated, this body had been weak after hitting her head. Therefore, most of her ‘fainting’ had actually been true.</p>
<p>However, when she woke up, she saw that there was no one accompanying her in the broad single room.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but smile bitterly.</p>
<p>The original body really lost all intimacy between husband and wife. In theory, even if they held no feelings for each other, this body gave birth to Shen Yichong’s son. Shouldn’t he, at the very least, accompany her in the ward for the sake of the child?</p>
<p>She looked at her right hand, which had a needle inserted on it and was afraid. She has always been in good health in the zoo and has never had an infusion. After a slight movement, she found nothing but numbness, swelling, coldness, and other discomforts.</p>
<p>Only after a while, did she calm down her heart, touching under the pillow to find her mobile phone.</p>
<p>This was the first time she saw today’s hot search.</p>
<p><i>Hahahaha!</i></p>
<p><b><i>#MadamShenInfidelity: committed suicide for divorce!</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>#MadamShenOverdoseSleepingPills: dead or alive?!</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>#MadamShenSecretCrushFimEmperorChenForManyYears</i></b></p>
<p>Sure enough, as she guessed, gossip about her suicide and infidelity had come out. Fortunately, the photos showing her unconscious were beautiful.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled in satisfaction and opened her verified microblogging account. She was a third-rate star because she has been pregnant with a child and only planned to come back recently, so there was almost no buzz about her on social media.</p>
<p>But now, only one person occupies the top ten hot searches, and she didn’t know whether Yu Xinjie helped the media play it.</p>
<p>If so, then, of course, she must accept this sister’s good intentions. She’ll take a good swipe at this huge popularity!</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao saw today’s Hot Search Number 10, she remembered the news that the national treasure panda, Meimei, was pregnant and had once occupied this spot. She couldn’t help but laugh more, her lips perking up.</p>
<p>After all these years of being a snake, this is the first time she has overshadowed the panda.</p>
<p><i>Oh, happy~</i></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, unfamiliar with her new fingers, smiled and typed slowly, posting a real-time micro-blog update. She glanced at the needle in her hand again in fear, and obediently laid down in bed, not daring to move at random.</p>
<p>After a while, the exhaustion her body felt really eased her slowly into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong and his assistant entered the ward and saw her lying limp on the bed, her back facing them. He could not but pinch his eyebrows to a frown.</p>
<p>His assistant, Chen Lin, was beside him looking at a tablet, and carefully looked at his face. “Boss, are we to come forward and clarify?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao did not take sleeping pills. Her fainting was caused by malnutrition due to weight loss and a mild concussion.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong narrowed his eyes and his lips spit out two words coldly, “No need.”</p>
<p>Chen Lin looked up in surprise. “But—”</p>
<p>“When the parent-child activity in Shen Rui’s Kindergarten is over, you may contact a lawyer.”</p>
<p>Chen Lin immediately held his breath and could not help but look at Mrs. Shen on the bed.</p>
<p>After years of working with his boss, he naturally knew what it meant to find a lawyer—he wanted a divorce.</p>
<p><i>Although Mrs. Shen is beautiful, she really let the boss down. After all, no man can tolerate his wife cheating.</i></p>
<p>Chen Lin nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>But just as he was about to write the note down on his iPad, he saw an update of Mrs. Shen’s old Weibo tagging <i>@ShenYichongOfficialBusinessMicroblog.</i></p>
<p>He froze, and hurriedly opened the update. He then looked at Shen Yichong with a glazed look on his face. “Boss, Madam… just posted a tweet.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned and scowled at the woman in bed. “What did she say?”</p>
<p>He took the iPad into his hands and read from the top.</p>
<p><b>Yu Yaoyao:</b></p>
<p><b><i>Whimpers</i></b><b> tried to make the second baby last night, only to faint and bump my head on the bed</b><b><i> (blush) (blush) (blush)</i></b></p>
<p><b>I’m sorry to have worried you.</b></p>
<p>This paragraph was followed by an image of a medical case of which it said:</p>
<p>Malnutrition, concussion after a minor impact… exhaustion…</p>
<p><i>Chen Lin swallowed saliva and looked at the boss’s expression. No need to clarify, I see…? Is the boss really so aggressive at night?</i></p>
<p>Indeed, it’s not good news to knock your wife out in bed!</p>
<p>“Boss, I will go to the lawyer now and sue these small media outlets trying to slander Madam’s reputation!”</p>
<p><i>Why had he thought the boss wanted a divorce? </i>Chen Lin suddenly felt a burst of fear at almost misunderstanding his boss’ words. <i>Look what he did to his wife!</i></p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth was twitching fiercely. Holding the iPad hand, the blue veins on his forehead suddenly bulged!</p>
