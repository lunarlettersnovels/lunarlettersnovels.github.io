<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 152 – A CEO’s Hidden Talents (2) </strong></p>
<p>Surprise was evident on her petite face!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at her in silence, and continued in a low voice. “There is one that looks very special. The gardener plucked it, and placed the flower on a vase inside the house. Do you want to take a look at it, Your Majesty?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was extremely astonished by what her husband just uttered, jumped up directly from her position and covered the script in her hand tightly.</p>
<p>“Are you peeking?” Yu Yaoyao demanded. “You couldn’t have memorized all of it, could you?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pursed his lips. “Didn’t you read it twice?” Yu Yaoyao’s questioning eyes were immediately filled with sparkle and adoration.</p>
<p>“Were you always capable of remembering lines this way? That’s so amazing!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his hands, took the pen from the coffee table and made several comments on the documents he was working on; he closed it once he was finished and then proceeded with another document.</p>
<p>It was obvious that even when he’d heard her reciting her script, he wasn’t paying attention at all.</p>
<p><em>Is this really true? </em>Yu Yaoyao seemed to have discovered a ‘New World’.</p>
<p>“Wow! How did you do it?” She excitedly asked him. “Teach me quickly. How can you memorize so fast and do something else at the same time? Were you always good at multitasking?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at her and smirked. “I can’t teach you.” He then added. “We don’t share the same genes.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao bulged her cheeks, in an instant, and stared at him with a grudge.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his left brow. “You forgot to recite three sentences. You will practice yoga for one hour tonight. New punishments will be placed again tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Hey!” Yu Yaoyao hit his husband’s chest. “I didn’t. I only forgot a few words,” she added timidly after some time.</p>
<p>“You were so amazing back then that I completely lost attention to reciting my script… no… no… it is not counted… you scoundrel!“</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was silent but his expressionless eyes suddenly warmed up and a subtle smile emerged.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu, who had been constantly watching the monitor, had captured such an amazing scene and couldn’t help but smile warmly. He had a number of comedic and family-related variety shows to his credit, but he felt that the daily life inside this house had particularly touched his heart.</p>
<p>The interaction between the couple was not as passionate as the fundamental love between lovers; however, the two retained a trace of their interest for one another.</p>
<p>Back to what was happening on the couch-</p>
<p>Soon, Yu Yaoyao stopped her protest as she knew that she couldn’t win over him and could only accept sanctions he clearly specified. She fell on the sofa with a weak voice as she felt devastated. “I’m going to take a rest now because I will be exhausted <em>tonight</em>.”</p>
<p>“I also want to eat more food at noon and have sweet refreshments in the afternoon to supplement my strength for the yoga training tonight,” she said, holding the remote control tightly and pushing the script to the side, reluctantly.</p>
<p>As of the moment, Yu Yaoyao’s shoulders are still stiff as she was waiting for Shen Yichong’s gaze to withdraw from her.</p>
<p>“I want to rest after working, Husband,” she said, expressing her sentiments. “I have already memorized three pages of the script as well as practiced pronouncing difficult words in my lines.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes warmed up and finally nodded in response to his wife’s emotional appeal. “Rest for half an hour.”</p>
<p>“Ah… half an hour?” Yu Yaoyao pouted in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>“A minute has passed.”</p>
<p>And that effectively ended her protest.</p>
<p>“Oh!” Yu Yaoyao hurriedly took the remote control and chose a program. At first, she wanted to watch a sweet and lovely ‘Dog Blood’ drama to relieve her stress, but in the end, she decided to watch her latest show, as her goddess-like beauty mesmerized her as well.</p>
<p>[E/D: … <em>mesmerized her as well?</em> Such a cute narcissist!]</p>
<p><em>Replay of ‘In the Limelight’ episode three!               </em></p>
<p>All of a sudden, she noticed that the remote control button was not functioning well so she instantly stretched out her small left hand and intertwined it with her right hand.</p>
<p>Turning her head, she looked at the beautiful fairy appearing in the living room’s ultra-clear and large-screen TV.</p>
<p>“Oh God, why is she so beautiful?” She exclaimed aloud. “Ah, her beauty has captivated me! I can no longer change the channel!”</p>
<p>On that note, there were mixed reactions from her companions.</p>
<p>The husband’s mouth twitched upon hearing his wife. Some staff felt awkward at the sudden compliment the beauty shamelessly showered upon herself while watching her scenes. A few others were still in denial, thinking that they might’ve heard her wrong. And as for the director of ‘In the Limelight’, Zhao Yu… well, this one felt mentally disengaged and baffled at the sudden flattering remark.</p>
<p><em>Yu Yaoyao is doing it again!</em></p>
