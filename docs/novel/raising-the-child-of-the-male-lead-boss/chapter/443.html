            <p><strong>Chapter 320 – A Coy Little Bun (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Who she wanted to settled accounts with? She couldn’t reveal such a thing to Shen Yichong. She knew that much at least. The ‘erm’ was the best she should do right now.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao suddenly found herself surrounded by Shen Yichong. Her little heart nearly stopped beating. How was this man walking without making a sound?</p>
<p>“Um, I was just talking to myself,” Yu Yaoyao smiled stiffly, “Didn’t I tell Yu Xinjie that I’d make her pay back everything and settle accounts with her one day? She didn’t believe me back then,” she gave a soft, tense laugh, “And now, I’ve finally done it.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows, “So, you’re going to let her live in peace from now on?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gave another little laugh, “Of course. She can live peacefully now… As long as she stays offline. The netizens have killed her honor a thousand times over with their words and swift analysis, after all. She won’t be able to face me in the future to make any more trouble, husband. I was so immensely happy that I started talking to myself.”</p>
<p>The balcony wasn’t very bright. Other than the gentle moonlight, only dim light from the hotel room lit the current surroundings. Shen Yichong tilted his head to glance down at Yu Yaoyao. In such faint lighting, he could see the vague shape of her dainty face looking up at him from his arms. Despite her delicate countenance, her fragile appearance hid a huge amount of courage and she glowed with more bravery day by day. She was becoming increasingly more capable of regularly pulling in new fans.</p>
<p>If her words from just now were to be posted on the Internet, not only her friend, but the rest of the netizens would probably start calling her ‘Husband.’</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but sigh as he rubbed her head, “You’re starting to become naiver than our 5-year-old son. Go inside and put on more layers of clothes before stepping back onto the balcony.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her hand and covered her face. Her cheeks blushed beet red and her heart wouldn’t stop hammering. She couldn’t believe she was able to bluff her way out of the predicament. She had to stop herself from sighing in relief.</p>
<p>When the two of them re-entered the house, it became obvious that their son, who was gnawing on chicken bones, had overheard the conversation about his mother talking to herself in the cold night air. “Mommy,” he said, “whatever you had to say, you can say it in the house next time. I’ll make sure to cover my ears so I can’t overhear the things you’re talking to yourself about,” the little bun covered his ears to prove his point. “I’ll pretend to be deaf, don’t worry, you can talk all you want.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was amused by the little bun’s cute gesture and appearance. She gathered Shen Yichong and took a photo of the three of them clinking their glasses together over a pile of chicken bones and posted it on Weibo. She carefully wrote a long piece of text to accompany the heartwarming picture.</p>
<p><em>[Thanks to everyone who has worried about and taken care of me. I have been doing fine these days.</em></p>
<p><em>Being busy with filming and life in general, those negative sequences of events won’t bring me down so easily! I’m not too sad, it’s just that the script I’m currently working on made me very emotional. But I will continue to be brave!</em></p>
<p><em>Love you guys lots!]</em></p>
<p>Toward the end of the post, she tagged Wei Ming and stated that she was looking forward to teaching him in the future. She then took a photo of the 3-piece book set on acting that she had worked hard on reading through the past few days.</p>
<p><em>[Well, I’ve almost finished reading these. I can lend them to you in the future, they’re very good! Definite positive review. Buy 1, get 2 free. Improve by leaps and bounds!]</em></p>
<p>Netizens were notified of her posts and laughed along at her antics. Even Wei Ming, who had been traumatized by those textbooks during his undergraduate years, couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>
<p>Looking at the state of the books, it was clear that Yu Yaoyao wasn’t just reading them, but was studying hard. There were many bookmarks in the books, and page one of the books was opened and filled with notes and highlighting.</p>
<p>Wei Ming decisively replied with a wry smile:</p>
<p><em>[Have already studied them, Xiao Yu. However, the version I read may have been quite old. Will be troubling you in the future.]</em></p>
<p>A bunch of netizens, especially Wei Ming’s original fans, had a good laugh. It was rare for the senior Wei to join in on the fun and crack subtle jokes. They were all surprised.</p>
<p>And then the fans started commenting:</p>
<p><em>[My big bro actually has a few humorous cells in his body?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I have somewhat of a good impression of Yu Yaoyao now! Our old Wei suddenly abandoned his 50 years’ worth of calm conduct! Thanks for pulling him out and letting him showcase his human side!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Of course our Old Wei can! I have created a Weibo just so I can follow him, and I’ve created a few zombie accounts to give more likes on all his posts. If only he were to appear on Weibo more frequently and give us fans updates!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Don’t say it! I am going to follow Yu Yaoyao! For her to move even our family’s old antique hearts… One really must pay attention to her and give her credit!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Old Wei, I’ve read Yu Yaoyao’s Weibo post… I really do believe you can consider her a teacher. Tell us how much the tuition fee is, and we’ll crowdfund you!]</em></p>
<p>And again, Wei Ming hit the hot search.</p>
<p>Originally, because YY’s fans had politely left him alone, his ‘Study More!’ post had dropped from the top ten searches to the 30th or 40th place. But with this, his name rose once again to 6th place, and stayed, steadily climbing further up the ranks.</p>
<p>YY’s fans joined in on the fun, expressing their delight at Yu Yaoyao working so hard these days. They left messages one after the other:</p>
<p><em>[Our handsome husband has been working hard and studying seriously, I don’t have any excuse to be skipping on my homework now!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Okay, let me go do three sets of practice questions from the papers of the past five years. Bye-bye, going to study now!]</em></p>
<p>This hot search seemed to be the most positive Weibo content of the day.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s shift to a ‘serious, super-motivated and diligent top tier husband’ through a casual post resulted in a number of ‘wife-fans’ following along in the path to academic victory. And the selfie of the family of three eating their chicken dinner in their hotel room, made YY fans all over gush.</p>
<p>The ‘My Wife and I’ show didn’t miss the opportunity to take advantage of this hype either. They made a post of their own on their official blog:</p>
<p><em>[‘My Wife and I V’: I wash my hands and cook you dinner, you will never give up on me. Tonight, 9pm sharp, join us to watch the amusing daily life of the @YuYaoyao couple after their bankruptcy crisis!]</em></p>
<p>The previous week’s broadcast was rescheduled to that week due to the live telecast of the special ‘Finding a Husband’ segment.</p>
<p>And so, it was only now that the antics of the dual sand sculptures* were broadcasted; Yu Yaoyao and her son fighting and haggling in order to save expenses for the ‘suspected to be bankrupt’ Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>*Sand sculpture (沙雕): Chinese is the synonym of the curse word (idiot d*ckhead), usually used to insult someone and call them stupid.</p>
<p>The program was edited to be broadcast for one and half hours. Even though Yu Yaoyao’s family was already assigned the largest segment of the episode, only 40 minutes of the footage made it to the final cut. Even if that was the case, numerous scenes were kept, whether it be Shen Yichong picking up an imported vegetable, only for it to be placed back on the shelf by the little bun, or Yu Yaoyao’s prawn shell theory and wanting to save costs by stuffing herself with more rice. Before long, everyone was holding their stomachs and were doubled over in pain from laughter.</p>
<p>Little bun was sensitive but naïve with a high EQ. Yu Yaoyao was considerate yet funny. This contrast left the audience both wanting to protect them and roused their maternal instincts, but at the same time made them laugh at their antics and plight. The end of the episode was a scene of the couple feeding each other that left everyone brimming with affection that overflowed from the screen.</p>
<p>The ratings of ‘Wife and I’ soared to a record high once again!</p>
<p>After the broadcast, the topic hit top searches on various platforms once more, and many public entertainment accounts used closeups and clips from the episode to capitalize on the recent heat.</p>
<p><em>[Strong Analysis! Why successful businessman Shen Yichong tolerated his blood-sucking mother-in-law for the sake of the love of his wife, despite her lack of reputation and status at the beginning of their marriage, is beyond me!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Golden finger: Boss Yaoyao teaches you how to overthrow a real boss!]</em></p>
<p><em>[The way to a man’s heart is through the stomach? Wrong! Boss Yaoyao will demonstrate how to directly attack the heart and guide you, step-by-step!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Textbook example of a model couple getting along with each other!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Young rich missy, I only belong to and am only willing to serve one woman in this lifetime!]</em></p>
