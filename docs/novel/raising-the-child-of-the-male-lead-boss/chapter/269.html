            <p><strong>Chapter 492</strong></p>
<p>All mothers knew that during breastfeeding, a mother not only had to pay attention to their diet, but they also needed to avoid public places as much as possible. Once they got infected with the flu or virus, it was easy to infect children. During summer vacation, it was a high-risk period for influenza. The cinema at the time was even more crowded and airtight.</p>
<p>Many mothers deeply agreed with Director Liang’s statement. The account that published the gossip was immediately scolded badly by the netizens. After everyone figured out the situation, their attention also shifted.</p>
<p><strong>[Did I see it wrongly? Yaoyao is about to make a new film?!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[May I ask what the theme of the new film is!?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[When will it be filmed and when will it be released, I can’t wait!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Is there any summary, let me see it!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Is she going to be the heroine? I love Yaoyao so much! Say no more, I’m getting a ticket for the premiere!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I hope for someone handsome for the male protagonist! I want a sweet love line in the play, please!]</strong></p>
<p>The fans who contributed so much tears to ‘Killer’ all let out a roar. This time they wanted a sweet movie!</p>
<p>Soon, a fan posted a super-long analysis post. The post also tagged the accounts of Guangxin, Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao. In simple terms, the post summarised all the programs shot by Yu Yaoyao after she gave birth to Shen Rui. Since then, she has always played a tragic character in her plays.</p>
<p>The only school drama ‘Invincible Youth’, where her character was not tragic, also talked about a chef’s struggle. The loveline was only auxiliary. It didn’t have many sweet scenes, since the theme was more inspirational.</p>
<p>The fan, ‘Love my goddess for 10,000 Years’ even ended the passage with the following: ‘<strong>Gosh, why did she never pick up a sweet and lovely character with such a beautiful face? If I’m going to die tomorrow, that will be my only regret~’</strong></p>
<p>The post was quickly seen by the YY fans, and they tried their best to repost it. The topic of Yu Yaoyao soon overwhelmed Weibo, and the fans all wanted her to pick up a romance-themed work. The marketing department that received such feedback was also very helpless. They then asked Shen Yichong for instructions.</p>
<p>“I think it’s quite sweet… Since they’ve swapped bodies… The characters would be scrubbing and rubbing each other’s backs. This time, the sweetness will definitely make them cry!” Yu Yaoyao explained.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong touched her head fondly. “Then how about you post it on Weibo yourself?”</p>
<p>His wife was a Weibo genius. She could win any battle easily, whether it was one the marketing department can or cannot win. Moreover, she was also very keen on interacting with her fans. Ever since the head of the fans came to their house, she was glued to her. She even had to be on several calls with her when they were in country T, with the excuse of learning English.</p>
<p>“Okay!” she beamed. “I can do that!” Yu Yaoyao pulled up her sleeves and drafted a reply to the fan.</p>
<p><strong>[@Love my goddess for 10,000 Years: Don’t worry, this time, it will definitely surprise you, it’s a character so sweet that you’ll even lose your teeth~ Big Head! Muah!]</strong></p>
<p>“It’s from Big Head.” Yu Yaoyao put it down and said with certainty. “I can already recognize how she praises me~”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, “…”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye who just registered a second account: “…”</p>
<p>It really caught her off guard that her identity was revealed so quickly!</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When the fans were still laughing out loud, Yu Yaoyao had already dressed up. She was meeting the director of the new film along with Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Director Li Bo, long time no see!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was very happy since she rarely saw an acquaintance. That’s right, the director of this film was an old acquaintance, Li Bo, who criticized her at the time, and then looked at her with admiration. He also introduced her to Director Qi Hang.</p>
<p>Li Bo was an honest man. He loved her now as much as how much he hated her back then! He had been thinking about cooperating with Yu Yaoyao again and letting her be his heroine. Unfortunately,she was focusing on the big screen, and there were no plans for TV dramas and web drama plans yet.</p>
<p>Li Bo, who was originally a TV drama director, had to move towards the big screen for Yu Yaoyao! As that would be his first movie, he didn’t dare to care to aim high and he didn’t dare to waste the resources of a good script and a good actress.</p>
<p>After “Empress”, he had been doing nothing for nearly two years. He was just watching movies to analyse the processing of each shot, lighting, the plot, as well as the characters’ expression. This time, he also went to country T in person. Before the project started, he came to find a suitable shooting location to perfect his storyboard.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, Xiao Yu,” he greeted.</p>
<p>Li Bo was filled with emotion. He remembered calling her a pretty but useless woman. But when he got a good script this time, his first thought was that he had to have Yu Yaoyao act in it. In his mind, there was no other actress who would qualify for the role.</p>
<p>“Xiao Yu, have you read the script? This time, you will play two roles,” he said.</p>
<p>One was the heroine. And the other one was a character that had the appearance of a woman but the heart of a man after experiencing a soul exchange with the male protagonist. This was more difficult than playing two roles.</p>
<p>“Not only will you have to deduce their differences in age and personality, but you also need to deduce the gender differences,” he explained.  “I don’t think there’s anyone more suitable than you that can act out the feeling I want.”</p>
<p>Li Bo couldn’t help but start the conversation with work. To him, Yu Yaoyao’s willingness to play this role was simply a surprise! With her current success, she could definitely pick up any movies of famous directors and aim for the awards, instead of playing in his debut big screen project.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve seen it. Director Li, you can count on me~” Yahoo chirped. Then, “I’m a woman who sleeps with two men every day!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s statement made Shen Yichong’s face twitch on the spot!</p>
