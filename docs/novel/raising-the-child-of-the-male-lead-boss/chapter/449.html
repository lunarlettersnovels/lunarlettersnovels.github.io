            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 314 – Inborn Talent (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>The entire crew quickly discovered Director Qi Hang’s anomaly; he was actually a very gentle, artistic uncle. Other than being a big fan of NGs, he had no other characteristics that people could complain about. He was very kind, never scolded anyone, and he was very meticulous when he was talking to the group of actors about the script.</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been for everyone having to work overtime or having to repeat the same scene over and over again until it got boring, he would have become the most amiable director in the field. But he had changed since this morning. He no longer had so many NGs!</p>
<p>That afternoon, Wei Ming arrived on-set to continue filming his rivalry scenes with Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>The crew were worried about what was coming up. Although Wei Ming was a veteran actor, he had broken the record of the NGs in the crew; a total of 37.</p>
<p>Just when everyone was going to bet on the number of NGs for the previous take, Director Qi hadn’t called for a single one until the last line!</p>
<p>When Wei Ming arrived on-set, he heard the assistant mention Director Qi’s sudden attitude change since that morning. He didn’t believe it. Every time he’d shot, he’d get a ‘cut’ every two lines or after an action. He was already so used to it.</p>
<p>But today, there hadn’t been a single ‘cut’ called for him? The situation felt unreal.</p>
<p>Today’s play was a retrospective filming of his and Yu Yaoyao’s daily life before she’d found out about the affair. They’d been having dinner together and talking about the child’s problems. At this time, the character had still had the sense of fatherhood and had been a reliable husband.</p>
<p>He thought that Director Qi would for sure pick on his usual filming habit, which was raising his eyebrows when acting with actresses. It was a habit from the last filming he’d done that had lasted more than three months. He couldn’t correct the habit now. Up until now, he’d gotten headaches from the NGs he’d gotten due to it.</p>
<p>“Director, I passed the scene? It was all good?” Wei Ming said as he touched his eyebrows. He knew this flaw was not part of the character’s personality. When the show was broadcasted, it would definitely draw a portion of the audience’s attention. It might even remind them of the previous drama and his role in it.</p>
<p>Director Qi picked up his thermos, the corner of his mouth picked up in a smile, “I recently found out that you all have more NG goals than I do,” he sipped from his thermos. “Why are you all so demanding of yourselves? Is everyone so dissatisfied with their performances that you feel you need another shot?”</p>
<p>Wei Ming shook his head, “Let me tell you, this change of yours makes me feel weird.”</p>
<p>Director Qi smiled again and had another sip of water to moisturize his throat before speaking, “The shot was okay. You can watch on the monitor yourself. If you still insist on doing it again, you can.”</p>
<p>Wei Ming was dumbfounded, “Director, what do you mean when you say I’m demanding of myself by wanting another take?” he stretched his hands helplessly and smiled awkwardly at Yu Yaoyao. “I know I haven’t changed my habit of raising my eyebrows. I know this affects the authenticity of the character. Director, did I say something during filming yesterday that made you upset? I know you always ask for NG because you strive for high quality and aesthetics. I will cooperate with you… Please don’t be upset,” then he turned to Yu Yaoyao, “Xiao Yu, I am really sorry, I know I have caused you to have to retake the scenes,” he couldn’t help feeling guilty about it.</p>
<p>Although Wei Ming wasn’t old, he had been acting for more than ten years. Because of that, he wasn’t as flexible as the younger actors. He needed time to adjust and pull himself out of character once he was immersed in it. The shooting of this film had been soon after his previous one and he hadn’t had time to adjust.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it again. I will not raise my eyebrows this time. I will control myself-” before he finished speaking Yu Yaoyao interrupted.</p>
<p>“Brother Wei, you did not raise your eyebrows. I didn’t see any of that,” she said after she’d gotten a yogurt drink from her assistant.</p>
<p><em><strong>This chapter was brought to you by Lunar Letters. Please read at the original site.</strong></em></p>
<p>Wei Ming was confused, “Really?” he knew these kinds of subconscious micro-expressions couldn’t be controlled, so he really did have no idea if he’d done it or not.</p>
<p>He quickly walked behind Director Qi’s monitor and carefully looked at the shot that had just been taken.</p>
<p>The scene of the two having a meal was taken from the left side, which was considered to be a middle shot. The left side of Yu Yaoyao’s face and the right side of his face were in the shot. From time to time, they ate as they had a dull but daily conversation between husband and wife. They went from their son’s studies to his admission to elementary school. Then they talked about celebrating his mother-in-law’s birthday.</p>
<p>This scene was about three minutes long. Wei Ming watched carefully. His gaze was fixed on his own face from the beginning to the end, and he didn’t once see himself raise his eyebrows. Not only that, but his expression as a husband was natural.</p>
<p>At first, he showed concerned about his son’s studies. He even seemed a little worried. But when Yu Yaoyao repeatedly complained about how cumbersome the admission procedures were for elementary school, and constantly mentioned the examinations, questionnaires and interviews he needed to go through as a father, his expression gradually became impatient. His eyes began to lose focus and started wandering. He even lowered his head to quickly finish his meal.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao started talking about her mother’s birthday the following week, where to celebrate it and even a small trip, he frowned. He showed obvious boredom and disinterest, even going so far as to look to the side and lie about going to work overtime.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole process, his acting was on point. No eyebrows were raised, nothing that could draw the audience’s attention away from the scene.</p>
<p>“How is it? Do you want to retake it?” Qi Hang said, squinting at the monitor.</p>
<p>Wei Ming looked up and smiled, “No need, I didn’t even know my spirit was back-” halfway through, he stopped. He turned his gaze to the monitor again.</p>
<p>His spirit was back? No. It was Yu Yaoyao who had gotten him so immersed in the scene. He was a husband and father off-set as well. Today’s play was not only the character’s daily life, it was also his very own. And Yu Yaoyao’s demeanor while they’d been shooting, as well as her constant grumbling, everything about her had resembled an annoying wife.</p>
