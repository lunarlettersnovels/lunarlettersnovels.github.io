            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 24 – Chicken and A Script</strong></p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao got home she received a script from Ni Yi.</p>
<p>The cover made with green leather was printed with four characters, which read ‘Golden Age Empress’. Her eyes couldn’t help but flash at the excitement of running her hands over it. She couldn’t help but place a big kiss on the cover!</p>
<p>She can finally act! Since the beginning of time, she had always wanted to act as the heroine!</p>
<p>She placed the freshly squeezed orange juice from her hand unto the tabletop.</p>
<p>She turned to look at the little steamed bun sitting on the sofa and saw him staring at her, so she lovingly blew him a kiss. “Little Rui Rui, Mommy is going to work for a while. You play by yourself for now, okay?”</p>
<p>The little bun immediately turned pink and slowly nodded. He grasped the tablet in his hand seriously, pretending that he was also very busy.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had gone to work, leaving only the mother and son to be together. But fortunately, the little steamed bun had refrained from disturbing her. He cleverly looked at his online elementary school class and sneaking a look at his mommy, he would turn the volume down. The nanny next to him wanted to take him back to the room but he only refused.</p>
<p>He only wanted to stay in the living room.</p>
<p>While watching his online class, he would stealthily steal glances at her. Usually, his mommy always went back to her room after eating and would rarely spend time with him in the living room.</p>
<p>The little bun had one hand propped below his chin, while the other handheld the small tablet. The corners of his mouth were faintly upturned.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao opened the first page of the script, she became completely invested in it.</p>
<p>In the ‘Golden Age Empress’ script, she was going to star as a small supporting role. Her character’s name was He Ling, a beautiful girl who entered the imperial palace together with the female lead.</p>
<p>He Ling had a refined, tantalizing beauty, that after the selection of concubines, the male lead, who was the emperor, became so smitten with her and made her a pampered consort. It was a pity that she was too arrogant and a show-off, therefore provoking the hatred of several masters in the inner palace. They eventually schemed against her, causing her death.</p>
<p>This role was considered an insignificant woman, among the numerous female casts inside this palace drama. However, her character would survive the first five episodes. Yu Yaoyao thought, as her first experience in acting, this was already good. It’s difficult to be an ideal person, besides, one cannot ask for too much.</p>
<p><i>Thank you, Buddha Tathagata. Thank you, Bodhisattva of Compassion. </i>Yu Yaoyao whispered heartfelt thanks several times in her heart.</p>
<p>After reading her little script, she started from the first page and studied it again. She even asked for a pencil from the little steamed bun to mark important notes on her lines carefully.</p>
<p>But she had trouble writing, her handwriting was askew… From time to time she would stop, think about how to write properly.</p>
<p>The little steamed bun stretched out his neck and glanced at her notes, and he blinked in disbelief.</p>
<p><i>How are the words that mommy wrote uglier than what he wrote? </i>He thought incredulously.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>Moreover, there seem to be typos now and then?</i></p>
<p>He looked at it for a while and almost covered his little eyes. <i>Mommy gave up writing, she started to draw doodles!</i></p>
<p>“Mommy… you can’t write the word ‘leg’?” he asked somewhat timidly.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stopped writing and had an awkward look on her face.</p>
<p>After a long time browsing the internet, she could finally understand how to read Chinese characters, but to write them… she often forgot how to write these words. She spent her time on her mobile phone only typing, always using pinyin. She had also studied in an online primary language school.</p>
<p>But now…<i> is she really worse than her little child?</i></p>
<p>The little bun looked at the messy scribble of a chicken drumstick of his mommy and stretched out his short fingers towards the table to stroke it fondly.</p>
<p>“Dad taught me how to eat roast chicken last time…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blushed. Seeing that this toddler was able to understand her messy scrawls, she couldn’t help but praise him. “Little Ruirui is really smart!”</p>
<p>The little bun immediately closed his mouth and shyly looked down at his toes. His two short, chubby legs swayed back and forth, and he was in a good mood.</p>
<p>“Then you write it here for Mommy.”</p>
<p>The little bun looked up and his eyes twinkled happily. “Okay!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gestured to a line in the script. “Here, write a ‘big chicken leg’. Here, three big chicken legs and this… a big chicken!”</p>
<p>The little bun looked confused.</p>
<p>“This represents the different feelings of the mommy’s role.” Yu Yaoyao looked at the script with a satisfied nod. “Write it all down and when I finish my lines, baby, you’ll see mommy’s amazing acting!”</p>
<p>Although Little Bun didn’t understand, he still nodded. And his little eyes were glimmering expectantly.</p>
<p><i>Mommy on the TV! Just save it and play it back every day!</i></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, inspired and helped by her son, worked hard and read the script three to four times. In the end, all her lines were circled, and her notes were written. She waited until it was the first day for the cast and production crew to meet.</p>
