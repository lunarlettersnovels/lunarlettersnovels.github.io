            <p><strong>Chapter 470</strong></p>
<p>“Okay, my compliment goes like this—”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao shared her question for Fang Qiuye soon. She picked up a written note and started to read seriously.</p>
<p>“Despite a distance of tens of millions of kilometers, you’re like the milk bubbles on a delicious latte, wrapping me tightly and warmly, and filling my life with the fragrance of milk. I love diamonds, but I love your eyes that shine like diamonds after you take your glasses off. Your hearts are like diamonds, yet still warm. The distance isn’t enough to block your charm. Thank you for loving me. I love you all too! To my fans across the ocean.”</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao finished reading, the comments section in the live broadcast room went silent for a second. Even the comments who were seeking for English major boyfriends had now disappeared completely!</p>
<p>Everyone went dazed. Why did her passage sound so familiar? Everyone wanted to cry after giving it a thought! Weren’t these from the praise they wrote for her? Did she edit and make an advanced version of it for the fans?</p>
<p>Oh god! They had never seen such a gentle goddess!</p>
<p>But…why was this for the foreign fans?!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was so envious! Forget it, she didn’t think Yaoyao had bias for her foreign fans anyway. She might just want to learn English and practice her ability to write essays. After all, she would get to learn vocabulary and grammar from such a long passage. On top of that, the content was not boring. Even she felt like learning it after listening to what Yaoyao said.</p>
<p>As Fang Qiuye comforted herself, she quickly typed the paragraph into Baidu Translate. Then, she looked back at Ye Yun expectantly.</p>
<p>“Does this seem right?”She whispered. She also put the microphone close to Ye Yun and motioned her to translate it to Yaoyao. However, she only saw Ye Yun’s stiff expression after a few seconds.</p>
<p>“I love you,” her mouth twitching, Ye Yun finally squeezed out a sentence to the microphone.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s eyes widened. <em>‘And then what?!’ </em>And then…Ye Yun just stayed silent. Fang Qiuye glared at her again! That was all for the translation?! Didn’t she have meetings with foreigners?!</p>
<p>All that she had translated was ‘I love you’ from that whole paragraph!? She knew it was wrong even if she didn’t know English well.</p>
<p>“That’s what it meant,” Ye Yun insisted shamelessly even when she was blushing.</p>
<p>Who would say something like that in meetings with their superiors?! She would definitely get thrown out by her boss!</p>
<p>Also, why would Yaoyao want to show her love to the foreign fans? Ye Yun felt that she was very reasonable. Although she failed the translation, she acted innocently.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was about to cry. Let alone Mr. Shen, even Yaoyao would know this was just wrong! She looked at her screen… Right! Fortunately, she was fast enough to type in most of the words from just now. Baidu Translation can save her life!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye smiled at the screen. She immediately grabbed the microphone back from Ye Yun. Then, she read out the passage.</p>
<p>Ye Yun frowned tightly after listening for a while. Then, she leaned over to look at the screen. The translation seemed pretty accurate and beautiful. She didn’t know technology had gotten so advanced now…</p>
<p>When Fang Qiuye finished reading it all, Yu Yaoyao’s exclamation sounded at the same time.</p>
<p>“Wow, you are amazing! Gentle temper, you’re so good!”</p>
<p>Her praise instantly made Fang Qiuye’s heart flutter. Fang Qiuye suddenly also felt that she was very good at this time. “Don’t mention it! Yaoyao, tell me what else I can do for you!”</p>
<p>She began to be proud after being praised by her idol.</p>
<p>“Hmm… I think that’s all for now.” Yu Yaoyao’s gentle voice soon came over. “I’ll start making your order! Please give me some time.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye smiled like a child who was on summer vacation, “Sure, sure! I’ll wait no matter how long it takes. Please don’t rush and be careful not to hurt yourself.”</p>
<p>“Okay! Thank you~” Yu Yaoyao answered happily. Turning around, she saw her husband nod in approval of the netizen’s answer. An idea flashed in her mind instantly.</p>
<p>“Gentle temper, do you want to be my English teacher?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s smile froze. “Huh?”</p>
<p>“I would like to have you as my teacher because you sounded so smart!” Yu Yaoyao blurted out, but she did not see the shocked expression of the staff at the scene and her husband.</p>
<p>She always did whatever she felt like doing. But it wasn’t nonsense. First, she really needed teachers and a systematic plan to study. Second, Shen Yichong had to go to work and would be tired when he got home. Her son was also learning so fast; she felt that she was dragging his progress…</p>
<p>Therefore, she needed a teacher who could customize the course according to her learning progress. Since the netizen was able to translate it so quickly, and she spoke so fluently, Yu Yaoyao assumed that she was very capable. After seeing her husband, Shen Yichong, also nodding in approval, she decided to request for her help humbly.</p>
<p>“If you are willing to teach me, I can cook for you every day.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was in shock. Of course she was willing to! The problem was…she wasn’t good! She was a fraud! What should she do!? Fan Qiuye was helpless. It seems like she had to marry an English teacher no matter what!</p>
