<p><strong>Chapter 408</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Ren Sitong knew she could not persuade Yu Yaoyao. She finally agreed to talk to Da Fu before passing her the script. “Your money also didn’t fall from the sky. Even if Da Fu needed investment funds, I wouldn’t ask that of you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t think much on it. “Fine, fine. So long-winded. I’m pregnant, I don’t see why I still have to listen to you chirping. I almost fell asleep. Xiao Sisi, you’ve changed. You’re no longer cute… Show me the script before I fall asleep.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong couldn’t say no.</p>
<p>After waiting for an hour, Yu Yaoyao finally got the script. It was a story about a stray cat. But the stray cat was very humane. After being taken in by a writer, the interaction between the two was very interesting and full of warmth and love.</p>
<p>She smiled the entire time as she read over it.</p>
<p>The theme of the script was ‘If people treat animals sincerely, animals will give back to the people’. Yu Yaoyao particularly liked the theme where the cat was taking care of its owner like he was the underling.</p>
<p>She was obsessed with it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Shen Yichong came to tell her to go to sleep that she realized it was already well into the night.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong saw the light smile on his wife’s face, which he hadn’t seen for a very long time, he smiled faintly. “Go to sleep. You can continue tomorrow.”</p>
<p>After a long day, she was finally happy.</p>
<p>During her filming period, she would cry when she came home, but she would always smile after that. But when the filming was over, and she stayed at home all day to rest, she smiled less and less.</p>
<p>She would text or call her husband after he’d only been at work for half an hour, crying to him about her nightmare. She dreamed that she was locked up, and she couldn’t see the daylight. Then, she dreamed that she was being eaten at a barbecue, and that people used her to make tonic wine to replenish their bodies…The nightmare she had was getting more and more exaggerated and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong asked a few doctors he knew about it, and they all said that she was feeling insecure and sensitive because of her pregnancy. These symptoms could be slowly eased, and that she should relax or think about something happy.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had been so stressed trying to lift his wife’s mood.</p>
<p>Other than imposing strict control and not allowing her to eat snacks, he had no bottom line compromising on her requirements.</p>
<p>“Darling, I like this script,” Yu Yaoyao said as Shen Yichong tucked her into bed. She held the script out to him as she spoke. “Xiao Sisi said her husband wrote it. He’s amazing! I really like his ideas. I like the kitten and the writer protagonist.”</p>
<p>A person and a cat, who obviously had language barriers and disliked each other at first, become the best of friends by the end.</p>
<p>The writer knew when the cat went out to play, when it came home, when its mealtime was. The cat also knew what time the writer should sleep, work, and when he was in a bad mood.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s jaw clenched with envy. If the breeder back then had known her like the two characters knew each other, her life would have been easier.</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes at the thought. “Darling, I’m so jealous of this.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth tightened. After a short mental battle with himself, he took a deep breath. “Do you want a kitten? I’ll ask the doctor if you can have one, and what breed would be suitable.”</p>
<p>Wrapped snugly in the quilt, Yu Yaoyao sighed contently. “No, darling. I don’t want a kitten.”</p>
<p>Cats were one of snakes’ biggest enemies. For now, she didn’t want a cat.</p>
<p>“I’m just envious of that kitten. The writer knows what it wanted just by it raising its paws or wriggling its butt… Although he started out saying no, by the end he did his best to satisfy its needs and wants.” Yu Yaoyao blinked her eyes, revealing her mysterious yearning sparkling in their depths.</p>
<p>The corner of Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. Leaning over, he took the script away from her. “Do you want me to invest in his project?”</p>
<p>“Darling…” Yu Yaoyao’s expression turned soft and sweet. “You’re so smart! The best poop cleaner! Come here, let me give you a kiss!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t resist.</p>
<p>The live broadcast camera was pressed against the quilt, and the broadcast room went dark. But the viewers could still hear them talking.</p>
<p>Soon everyone in the comment section was having a good laugh.</p>
<p><em>[I finally know how Yaoyao captured Mr. Shen’s heart.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao: Oh no! Did I leak the secret that I treat my husband as my poop cleaner?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen: So, I happened to have raised a… Cutie!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen would do anything for his wife except clean her poop! Haha!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen has a new title!]</em></p>
<p>But some people accidentally found more hints in this.</p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen said he would ask the doctor if they could have a cat because he thought Yaoyao wanted one…Comrades, I boldly guess that Yaoyao is more than three months pregnant!]</em></p>
<p><em>[It must be true! The baby is coming!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Baby Rui: My mommy no longer mentions that she wants another baby… Um, because, she already has one in her tummy!]</em></p>
<p>The fans were so happy, and they rewarded them with more gifts.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Wansheng’s Film and Television Department was planning a new publicity stunt as they prepared actress Du Jingya to replace Yu Yaoyao in ‘Emergency Moment’.</p>
<p>After being lowkey for a little while, they finally found a flaw in Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>The press release was immediately written.</p>
<p><em>#Director Cai: Du Jingya bested Yu Yaoyao in a crying scene#</em></p>
<p><em>#A hardworking and gifted actress who is way better than the rich lady!#</em></p>
<p>The video attached in this news was comparing Du Jingya’s crying scene during her audition to Yu Yaoyao’s crying scene in ‘Stage’.</p>
<p>They also provided two pictures. One was Du Jingya reading the script and memorizing her lines while her assistant was still sleeping at dawn, and the other was of Yu Yaoyao lying on the crew chair, while her manager paged through the script for her, and another assistant brought her bread.</p>
<p>The contrast between the two was very sharp. The writer obviously wanted to elevate Du Jingya by stepping on Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>By 11 o’clock in the evening the topic had risen to the top. And by the next morning, the gossip hadn’t stopped coming.</p></div>
