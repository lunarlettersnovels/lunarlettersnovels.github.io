            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 125 – The Male Lead’s Unlikely Rival</strong></p>
<p>When getting on the car, Ni Yi carefully placed himself in the front seat, handing things to the back from time to time. A hot water bag, something to warm Yu Yaoyao like ginger tea, and even a cooling patch.</p>
<p>But after a while, he turned his head and stared straight at the road ahead, not daring to look back.</p>
<p>“Boo, I don’t want to drink ginger tea. It’s bitter and spicy. My tongue hurts…” came Yu Yaoyao’s voice.</p>
<p>“Bear it,” was the other party’s brusque reply.</p>
<p>“Oh, no. It hurts… would you cool down my tongue?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi, an older single dog, hated that he couldn’t jump out of the window in an instant.</p>
<p>“Huhu…”</p>
<p>“Swallow it, stop being finicky.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Husband, feed me the drink instead…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“If you don’t feed me, I’ll hurl again.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Bowing his head, Ni Yi took out his mobile phone and opened Yu Yaoyao’s official microblog. He was the one who helped manage her account. Only, after a moment passed, a frown graced his fat face. But then, his anger multiplied, and he slammed the window.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao glanced at him immediately after hearing the violent sound. Although she was quite unwell, the vigilance in her bones was still thrumming. Upon hearing the noise, she raised her swan-like neck up.</p>
<p>“What?” Shen Yichong pressed her head back down, bringing another mouthful of ginger tea to her lips and asked on her behalf.</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s face currently looked ugly. When he glanced back at Yu Yaoyao’s weak face, he felt embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Who made trouble?” Shen Yichong’s eyes narrowed, his query coming out crossly.</p>
<p>Ni Yi nodded in mortification. “Online rumors about Meng Xinran withdrawing from <em>‘In the Limelight’</em> have been circulating around. A lot of netizens claim that elder sister used power from sponsors and the company… to put pressure on Meng Xinran and deliberately made her withdraw from the competition.</p>
<p>A group of haters say that elder sister is being given special treatment and is only pretending to be pitiful… Last night she played with an adult man inside her room, and…” Ni Yi trailed off.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Yu Yaoyao craned her neck in an uncomfortable way, attempting to dodge the ginger tea held by Shen Yichong with the intention of diverting his attention as well.</p>
<p>Ni Yi swallowed his saliva. “They said it was all planned beforehand. Elder sister, don’t be angry, don’t be angry and make your body feel worse… I’ll release a statement it was your pet snake that scared the man in the room, and everyone will understand.”</p>
<p>This unincluded detail in the video became the target of some ‘logical’ netizens who thought they have perfectly caught her farce. But yesterday, mostly positive comments overwhelmed these netizens, therefore they were still unnoticeable.</p>
<p>But upon news of Meng Xinran withdrawing from the competition, some of her fans began to dig through Yu Yaoyao’s stuff. In an instant, the haters remarks were pushed towards top becoming hot comments.</p>
<p>Ni Yi felt bitter. People on the internet are easily swayed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao pouted and placed her head weakly on Shen Yichong’s shoulder. “It wasn’t the snake, it was my beauty that scared him.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s mouth twitched and he looked helplessly at Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Shen Yichon, with hooded eyes, saw how she laid her head on him, and for a moment he did not speak nor push her away as he always did. Instead, he relaxed his tense shoulder muscles to make her feel more at ease. He stretched out a hand to touch her forehead and frowned when he found that it was warm.</p>
<p>“None of that matters. Just let the company’s marketing team handle it.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gave a soft grunt and leaned her whole weight on him, even sliding slowly onto unto his thighs… Shen Yichong’s face immediately became dark. And Ni Yi’s face was also quite brilliant, as he immediately turned his head away in fright!</p>
<p>And Yu Yaoyao, feeling dizzy, didn’t forget to tell the main point. She absently muttered, “Remember to put me in…”</p>
<p>“Include your photo?” The corners of his mouth slightly lifted.</p>
<p>Yawning with a wide mouth, Yu Yaoyao nodded enthusiastically. “Mhmm! Also…”</p>
<p>She raised a hand and softly touched Shen Yichong’s chin. “Don’t pay people to scold them for me… one day, these people will become my fans… in the future… they will all be family…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi heard and almost laughed. His siter is truly confident, there’s no doubt about it!</p>
<p>Her hot palm which gently brushed against Shen Yichong’s cold, hard jaw made his neck turn stiff. His heart rate sped up and he felt his throat was parched. When he lowered his eyes, he saw that she had already gone to sleep from her drowsiness.</p>
<p>Her little, sickly face was pale, and the once red lips had lost its color upon wiping off her lipstick. With her eyes closed, her lively charm was gone in an instant.</p>
<p>With a cautious hand, his fingers traced her smooth cheek. He tried to feel her temperature, as well as the rhythm of breathing, and the frown in his eyebrows became faint.</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>The car sped to the hotel with the family doctor already waiting for them. On their arrival, the doctor quickly examined her and came to the same conclusion that Ni Yi had guessed. She had caught a cold and needed to be prescribed only a simple medicine. With this, Yu Yaoyao was to stay at bed and rest.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Uncle Chen Lin had just fetched the little bun back from the kindergarten. The little bun wanted to rush so he could go with them pick up his mother from work, but he only caught unfortunate news of her sickness and went back to the hotel.</p>
<p>As soon as he pushed the door open, the little bun saw Yu Yaoyao lying motionless on the bed. She didn’t respond even as he went in. Unlike a few days ago, his mother would eagerly look, smile and say that her baby had just arrived…</p>
<p>The little bun immediately lowered his eyes as a heavy feeling settled in his chest. “Dad, when I grow up, you and mommy will divorce.”</p>
<p>With the last word, Shen Yichong’s eyebrows rose. Ni Yi stared back at Chen Lin, afraid to breathe for an instant. But the little bun continued, pouting despondently and said a second powerful declaration!</p>
<p>“In the future, I will marry mommy!”</p>
