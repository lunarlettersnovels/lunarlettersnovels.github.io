            <h3><strong>Chapter 199 – Busted (2)</strong></h3>
<p>“And, Xiao RuiRui~”</p>
<p>The little bun puffed out his cheeks in protest and spared a glance at Director Zhao.</p>
<p><em>Mommy and Daddy have been together for five years now, and I myself am almost five years old. </em></p>
<p>Shen Rui felt unhappy to have completely missed out on such a rite of passage!</p>
<p><em>They have never cooked for me but rather cooked for each other in the past? Hmph!</em></p>
<p>“Cooking?”</p>
<p>Shen YiChong raised his eyebrows. He seemed to be the only one in the family of three who had grasped the main point.</p>
<p>Director Zhao laughed. “Yes, and we provide all the ingredients for free.”</p>
<p>“For free?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao seemed to have revived her spirits the moment she heard those two magic words, her eyes instantaneously lit up.</p>
<p>Little Bun frowned, and stretched out his little finger in the air to finally point at himself. <em>You can’t forget about me…</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at the crew behind him, and then at Director Zhao’s eyes that were a sparkling mix of excitement and anticipation for snagging a chance to watch a show.</p>
<p>Director Zhao cleared his throat. “It’s all free, and it’s quite late already, almost six o’clock in the evening. You should be hungry, right? Let’s hurry up.”</p>
<p>Wide eyed, Yu Yaoyao immediately directed her gaze to the rear, trying to figure out what the ingredients were.</p>
<p>“Hmm, all right.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go!” Suddenly, Director Zhao’s face blossomed into a smile. “Xiao Yu is beautiful and kind, a good wife and mother. I have never come across a female artist as good as you.” Director Zhao’s hearty smile was testimony to his genuine praise, this showman was indeed sans all pretence.</p>
<p>Those words, and Yu Yaoyao was over the moon. In an instant, all her previous embarrassment flew down a garbage chute.</p>
<p>“Now, Xiao Yu, this money should be enough to purchase ingredients for a big meal for the two of you. Buy after planning well, and don’t waste any food.”</p>
<p>“No problem!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao became serious in an instant. “Wasting of food, even the heavens wouldn’t forgive!”</p>
<p>In the wild, survival was of paramount importance. Every living thing in the wildernesses, lived by the tenet what more a snake.</p>
<p><em>Food comes first! </em></p>
<p><em>Eat before hibernation, lest you starve through the long winters!</em></p>
<p><em>During difficult times, eat once a week. Save your energy at times other than hunting and try to consume as less energy as possible.</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao knew it all. She solemnly accepted the fat envelope from Director Zhao like her life depended on it. There was no need to make a mention of her attitude and eyes at the moment.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…..”</p>
<p>“President Shen.”</p>
<p>Director Zhao glanced at Yu Yaoyao who bowed down her head and happily started thinking about what ingredients to buy, and walked over to Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“I did receive your request, to be allowed to go to a gourmet restaurant for your second task.” Shen Yichong raised an eyebrow and shuffled over to meet Director Zhao in the eye. “By that, I meant going to a gourmet restaurant, not cooking from the scratch.”</p>
<p>Director Zhao scratched his head awkwardly. “President Shen, circumstances are currently very different. Starting last night, netizens have been very hostile towards you and your wife, there are many people raising their voices, protesting against you.” As he spoke, he put up his hands in helplessness and added.</p>
<p>“It stands to reason that your presence on this show has nothing to do with whether your company has a business crisis or not…,” said he, smiling bitterly, “… But as you know, it’s a fast paced life, and the viewers are under constant pressure. So, when they are home, watching variety shows, munching melons, they hope to see positivity,  seek gratification in others’ misfortunes… something that can help them escape their worries, evoke their fantasy of an ideal partner as they glimpse the daily lives of their gods and goddesses. So, early this morning, I discussed with the team and hurriedly proposed the new task to the scriptwriters.”</p>
<p>“As for the reason, though the program team cannot control and influence the public opinion directly, we can still sway the viewers with a direct message: Even if your husband or wife is at a low point in their life, they can shoulder the adversities, and face their setbacks with a heart full of enthusiasm and courage. No difficulty can defeat you.”</p>
<p>As Director Zhao shared his sentiments, he glanced at Shen Yichong trying to discern the stoic man’s thoughts..</p>
<p>“I made this decision after I saw Xiao Yu’s Weibo this morning.” He admitted, and upon taking a moment added. “If you have money, you can support her, but when you don’t have money, she will stand up to protect you from the wind and the rain; she can raise you. Her spirit of sharing adversities and never admitting defeat really touched me.”</p>
<p>His orbs were filled with admiration for the eccentric girl; he was indeed moved… his expression, never more serious. “As a middle-aged man, I have made many popular variety shows in the past, and now my career seems to have reached a peak. But I have to confess that I too suffer from a mid-life crisis; I am afraid of losing my wife if I were to take a single wrong step. I believe many young viewers, or even middle-aged viewers can understand why I am so touched by Xiao Yu.”</p>
<p>He turned to look at Yu Yaoyao, who was holding the child and a big red envelope looked absolutely content. “I hope her positive energy can be seen by more people. This is also my original intention for asking you to participate in this reality show. Not only is she funny, but is also obsessed with low-end snacks.” He chuckled and continued. “She has lived a lot better than most people, but she is ambitious towards what she wants to be, and she is on her way to become even better!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s black eyes flashed. He observed Director Zhao’s expression carefully. Following the other party’s line of sight, his seemingly calm but flickering gaze fell on Yu Yaoyao.</p>
