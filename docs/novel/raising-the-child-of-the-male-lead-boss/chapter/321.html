<p>Uncle Gangster? Chen Jiao’s eyelids jumped quickly. This title sounded very familiar. Didn’t Yu Yaoyao call him Gangster Chen before? But he never had the chance to ask what exactly this name meant because things always happened when he was about to ask. But now that Little Bun was calling him this way, he felt something was wrong.</p>
<p>In the live broadcast, many viewers also noticed this title. It was the first time the YY fans heard this name, and they suddenly had a lot of thoughts.</p>
<p><em>[Did baby Rui accidentally read any rated posts? I hope it wasn’t the gangster I was thinking about…?]</em></p>
<p><em>[What kind of gangster? I believe that baby Rui is a pure little boy.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Hehe..I think baby Rui learned this from Yaoyao.. He is not a kid who would casually choose a nickname for people, but our Yaoyao loves doing this!]</em></p>
<p><em>[The only thing that is certain is that it is definitely not taught by Mr. Shen.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen is not even surprised when baby Rui calls out this title. It seems that this family has always called Chen Jiao this way? In other words, is this a sign of a good relationship between them? Have we misunderstood Chen Jiao all the time?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Hmm? Could it be true that they don’t have bad blood?]</em></p>
<p>Everyone in the live broadcast room was very curious, and Zhao Yu also soon saw it.</p>
<p>In fact, Zhao Yu’s relationship with Yu Yaoyao’s family was relatively close, and he knew that the truth was not like what the audience thought. Chen Jiao had barely interacted with Yu Yaoyao’s family, and he had never heard kind words about Chen Jiao from the couple.</p>
<p>This time, Chen Jiao also proposed to offer generous terms of exchange just to appear on the show. Zhao Yu’s first reaction was to inquire about Shen Yichong’s opinion when he received the request. If Mr. Shen disagreed, then he wouldn’t agree to this request either.</p>
<p>‘Welcome to my house’ was a program just like its name. The host would first welcome the guest, then, everyone would work together and share the fruits of labor while chatting with each other. When Zhao Yu asked for Shen Yichong’s opinion through the phone, he was silent at first, but he quickly <a href="http://agreed.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agreed.It</a> wasn’t until then did he allow Chen Jiao to be a guest on the show.</p>
<p>Faced with these speculations in the comments at this moment, Zhao Yu also felt that the fans and audience shouldn’t have misunderstood the situation if they were not in a good relationship.</p>
<p>“Xiao Rui, why do you call Uncle Chen so? Is that the nickname you gave him?” Zhao Yu finally asked the question everyone was puzzled with.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was right on the side, but he only raised his eyes and looked down. He didn’t stop his son from answering the question.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Little Bun Shen Rui blurted out, “It was from mommy. Gangster Chen. Uncle Gangster.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu raised his eyebrows, “Huh?”</p>
<p>“A bully gangster!!” Little Bun Shen Rui pointed out the truth mercilessly.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao, who was about to go fishing, paused his footsteps upon hearing this. His face was pale.</p>
<p>A gangster and bully? Was this how Yu Yaoyao had always thought of him?</p>
<p>The corners of Chen Jiao’s mouth twitched. Yu Yaoyao…she really had changed a lot. Compared to Ling Shuang, she was more different than the nice and gentle girl from before! He had never thought of hurting her!</p>
<p>The fans in the live broadcast room finally learned the truth. The YY fans even felt extremely refreshed.</p>
<p>What they feared the most was when they had to pretend that they were okay when they were betrayed. To say that he was a hypocrite was nothing. His kind of behavior was simply mindless and made people angry. Luckily, their Yaoyao was a girl who dared to both love and hate. She also had the courage to express her dislikes. She would never deceive her fans for the sake of her image.</p>
<p>Shen Rui’s words made everyone learn that the relationship between the family and Chen Jiao was indeed not good.</p>
<p>Later, Chen Jiao quickly embarrassed himself in front of the camera. He joined the industry at a very young age, and he had never fished before. In the end, he only managed to catch two small fishes when his whole body was soaked and muddy. Even so, he received the contempt of Little Bun.</p>
<p>“Uncle, we should release them since they’re so small. We should not eat them. It is very cruel.” Little Bun pointed out the problem sharply and made Chen Jiao blushed. “Forget it, do something else if you don’t know how to fish. Can you clean the house? Or maybe sing to the audience?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyelids jumped, “…Then, I’ll sweep the floor.”</p>
<p>This was what he got after putting so much effort into begging Zhao Yu for a spot in the show? Did he beg for a summer camp? He suddenly felt that he was so cheap!</p>
<p>“Xiao Rui, where is your father? I’ll talk to him first.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao must at least achieve the goal he had coming here. He must have made things clear with Shen Yichong this time. When Shen Yichong accompanied Yu Yaoyao on maternity leave, he would not answer calls from outsiders.</p>
<p>“Uncle, are you trying to be lazy?”</p>
<p>Little Bun held his arms and puffed his cheeks strictly.</p>
<p>“Although my mommy is resting, she has to feed my little sister from time to time. She barely gets to sleep. Aunt Qianqian has been helping us wash quilt covers and dishes since just now. My daddy is in charge of buying and washing groceries  and cooking. And you… want to chat with my daddy only after catching two poor fishes that were about to die?”</p>
<p>The corner of Chen Jiao’s mouth twitched, and he looked at the child who barely reached his waist with tangled eyes.</p>
<p>Little Bun straightened out his chest without admitting defeat. This Uncle Gangster made mommy cry before. Then, he made his daddy angry with mommy, and he also made his little sister come half a year late…</p>
<p>He knew many things! He either saw it at home or saw what the fans say on the Internet! He wanted to avenge mommy. He wanted to avenge his little sister!</p>
<p>“Uncle Gangster, you are really incapable of anything.” Little Bun shook his head directly in front of the camera, and he sighed at Chen Jiao. “I’m so disappointed in you.”</p></div>
