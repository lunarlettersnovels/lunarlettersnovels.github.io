        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 88 – Seducing the Male Lead</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gracefully walked to the bathtub and stretched out her hand to test the water’s temperature. She bent down her slim waist, her red lips pouted, making the skirt move up deviously to expose a large part of her fair, smooth thighs…</p>
<p>And the next second—the world whirled before her eyes as she was pulled back by a big, hot hand by her waist. Her whole body was turned over and unceremoniously pressed against the screen.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to seduce me?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s voice was rough and deep, his eyes dark, hinting the deep emotions that currently swept through his eyes. His palm was pressed against her waist, pinning her to the screen, and his other hand squeezed the wrist of her injured right hand.</p>
<p>“You have performed very well recently, but I still want to remind you…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s head bowed low as his tall frame towered over her. His squinted eyes landed on her own wide ones and towards her tantalizing her curves, of which were likely about to burst from any moment.</p>
<p>His voice stern, he reminded: “Don’t test my patience.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao merely bowed her head to glance at his parted lips. She cheekily replied, “Mr. Shen, you don’t seem very honest with your feelings.” She raised her locked right hand, teased her tongue out defiantly and blatantly licked his warm fist.</p>
<p>It was as if a warm current swept through him, and into his fingers in an instant, making his body become shocked.</p>
<p>Apparently not yet over with her actions, Yu Yaoyao licked her lips and said, “I’m leaving home for three days. Mr. Shen, do you want to feel <em>ecstatic</em>…tonight?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes squinted immediately, and in the next second, Yu Yaoyao let out a scream as she was held up by him! She was instantly carried into the bathtub, emitting a big splash in the process.</p>
<p>“No need,” his low voice sounded above her head. Yu Yaoyao pouted, while Shen Yichong only turned around.</p>
<p>“In front of the public, you must protect your identity as Shen Rui’s mother and as madam Shen. If you agree to a peaceful break up, then you will be paid according to the contract…there’s no need to do extra things.”</p>
<p>He turned back and looked at her carefully. “However, you are going to be away from home this time for three days, so I have an extra request.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her drenched, small face towards Shen Yichong upon hearing this.</p>
<p>“Recently, Shen Rui is more attached to you than before. Every day he gets up and immediately comes to the next bedroom just to sneak a peek at you. And during at night, he also drops by to bid his mother good night—only then does he go back to his small bed and sleep in peace.”</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong said this, he finally had a trace of helplessness on his face.</p>
<p>“On the first day you went to the program set and were away from home, he came back from kindergarten restless, always thinking of you every time.”</p>
<p>He paused and said meaningfully, “While you are away from home, I hope you can take the time to have a video chat or phone call with him every day. At the very least, it would let him feel that although his mother is at work, she has not abandoned him, and that she will soon return back to him. This way, he won’t always be afraid.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes flashed and his feet halted after he got to the other side of the screen.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, I will not hinder your career in the entertainment circle this time. Even if I am the boss of the company, I will still support you.” When he had finished saying this, he turned sharply to the side and finally, hesitantly stood facing the screen, finding an angle as if he wasn’t looking at her at all.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was sitting in the bathtub, was initially stunned, but she soon turned to look at the screen, smiling subtly. On her side, she could clearly see the silhouette outlined by the light in front of her, but it only blurred his features, not covering them up entirely.</p>
<p><em>The place where this man was unable to calm down…even if you hide behind the screen, it can’t be covered.</em></p>
<p>Even now, it’s clearly reflected on the screen.</p>
<p>“Pfft,” She couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>She knew that she was more charming than the original owner. As she smiled and reminisced, she soon remembered that the original Yu Yaoyao rarely made the male lead so excited.</p>
<p>She was loads better!</p>
<p>“Okay, I will video chat. Oh, and husband, come in and get me a towel, will you?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong outside the screen froze. “Isn’t it everything already there?”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t like this one—I want the blue one.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a deep breath and walked towards the sink. Only when he washed his hands with cold water did he then calm down. But when he walked back over with a towel, he saw the curve of her neck’s reflection akin to a beautiful swan reflected on the screen. Yu Yaoyao deviously raised her head to reveal her upper body and her slender fingers brushed against her chest gently, as if she were scrubbing…</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s nose couldn’t help but feel hot. And he immediately covered his nose with the towel in his hand. “No blue towel. I’ll ask the maid to get you one,” he said. His long legs briskly ran out, slamming bathroom door shut.</p>
<p>“Dad, why do you have a nosebleed?” Outside the bathroom, the little bun cried in surprise seeing his father.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yu Yaoyao laughed and fell deeper into the bathtub.</p>
<p><em>Hmph! Let him fear me!</em></p>
<p><i>*</i></p>
<p>The next day Ni Yi came to pick up Yu Yaoyao and found that the boss’s face wasn’t very good, especially since there were dark circles under his eyes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the little bun sitting on the dining table had a face full of worry and was frowning deeply as he looked to and fro his father and mother. And lastly, the remaining barbecued pork bun on the table was broken into two halves and placed in their bowls respectively.</p>
<p>“Mommy, eat so your hand will heal. Dad, eat so your nosebleed will be gone.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s ears pricked up.<em> Oh my, the boss has a nosebleed–what’s the matter with him?</em></p>
<p>He stole another look at Yu Yaoyao. In just a glance, Ni Yi found the answer. His elder sister’s face, as if she had just eaten a rejuvenating pill, was glowing brightly.</p>
<p><em>Did elder sister gather yang and replenished her yin last night?</em></p>
