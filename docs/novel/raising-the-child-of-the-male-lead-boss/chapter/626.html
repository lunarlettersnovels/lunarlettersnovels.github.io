            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 126 – Meng Xinran’s Demise And Yu Yaoyao’s Comfort</strong></p>
<p>In a duplex hotel room, Meng Xinran, once a sweet, little flower, was now like a plant that had been battered by heavy rain; cruelly destroyed until she was almost withering. She knelt on the ground, her voice hoarse as she continuously pleaded, grabbing the man’s pants in front of her.</p>
<p>She was crying, almost out of breath. “Older brother Han, please help me! Please, <em>please</em> inform the other shareholders of the company about my situation and ask them not to block me!”</p>
<p>She held up her mobile phone and tried desperately to show the screen to the man. “Everyone on the internet now supports and speaks for me! I have millions of fans; I am much more valuable than that bitch Yu Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>“I will try my best to repay the company and make money for shareholders! Give me another chance!” she aggrievedly appealed.</p>
<p>Han Zhihong sighed deeply. “Little Ran, you mustn’t have a devious mind. Furthermore, you even went as far as to harm the boss’s wife. I thought that your frustration and unhappiness would only make you lose your temper… but not like this; you chose to hurt somebody else… this could land you in jail.” His eyes were full of helplessness as he mumbled his reply.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran was a promising newcomer whom he had enthusiastically introduced to the entertainment company, of which became the key actress the giant began to show support for. She once boasted one of the largest fanbase, but that all, was obviously ruined now.</p>
<p>He felt much sadder than anyone else!</p>
<p>He chided, “You should stay at home these days and refrain from thinking about anything. Don’t go out and don’t read anything online.”</p>
<p>“But elder brother, I was wronged! I didn’t do anything!” Meng Xinran’s tearful face was devoid of guilt.</p>
<p>Han Zhihong could not help but smile ruefully, “I truly hope so.” But when he remembered a familiar staff tell the whole incident, he knew Meng Xinran’s actions bordered on unusual that night.</p>
<p>Even if by some stroke of luck, she was not the mastermind, she had offended the big boss. Most of all, in front of so many eyes, she had shattered her pure image. For an idol’s persona to be destroyed, it was tantamount to suicide in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>“Brother Han, even you would give me up!” Meng Xinran looked up at him, disbelief on her face. “You told me that I would definitely become the hottest little flower in three years!”</p>
<p>Han Zhihong was only silent. Yes, she used to be. But now, the company has more dazzling female artists… or should he say, the madam.</p>
<p>The situation has vastly changed. Without another second, he left without looking back. “Take care, little Ran.”</p>
<p>It was not until the door was closed to her face that Meng Xinran fully felt despair.</p>
<p><em>Take care?!</em></p>
<p>Her tears gushed down uncontrollably, and her sweet face was like that of a broken doll.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Yu Yaoyao’s hotel room, the little steamed bun with his cheeks bulging, had just solemnly declared for his mommy’s hand with his father face to face.</p>
<p>“Mommy will marry me later and I will be good to her. I won’t be like dad where mommy got sick after one day out.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed his temples, looking at his son’s defiant eyes and laughed. “Unfortunately, the son cannot marry his mother, or this would break the marriage law.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun suddenly stared at him with round eyes, as if he had been hit by a bolt from the sky. His mouth slightly opened and plump face turning pale—he had been obviously hit hard by such news.</p>
<p>But soon, holding the faintest of hope, he eagerly turned towards the weak Yu Yaoyao lying in bed, “Dad must be lying to me. He’s afraid I’ll marry mommy when I grow up.” He muttered.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao still had an ongoing migraine, but upon hearing the little steamed bun’s remark, she laughed heartily.</p>
<p>She poked out an arm from under the bed that had not been pricked by the needle and stretched it towards the bun. “Idiot! When you grow up, there will be many beautiful girls waiting for you.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun immediately ran a few steps with his short legs and rubbed his little head on her palm. His eyes were full of tears, but he tried his best to hold it in, refusing to cry in front of his mother.</p>
<p>“Mommy is the only beautiful girl I want… mommy is the best in the world. I don’t want anyone else. None of them is as beautiful as mommy…”</p>
<p>With the little bun’s flattery, Yu Yaoyao instantly felt refreshed. She felt better than when she took medicine.</p>
<p>“Mommy, do you feel okay? Do you have a headache? Rui Rui will help massage your head. Mama Xu also press my head for me before. It doesn’t hurt at all!” The little bun hurried to climb atop her bed.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao stopped him with a smile. “To see my baby already makes me feel so much better. But I don’t want the baby to get too close to me, or else he’ll get sick too. Just sit on the sofa over there for me and chat with mommy, okay?”</p>
<p>She continued, “Mommy also has to drink Chinese medicine which is very bitter and difficult to swallow. If my baby talks to me while I’m taking it, it would become less bitter.”</p>
<p>The little bun immediately nodded, “Okay! Then I’ll tell mommy a story my teacher told me today!”</p>
