            <p><strong>Chapter 256 – Mr and Mrs. Smith (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu didn’t want Shen Yichong to go to the washroom. Shen Yichong was disguised most properly, but the Director didn’t feel confident enough. If Shen Yichong passed by Yu Yaoyao, she might recognize him, despite the disguise.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, for now, was only interested in eating the snacks she had bought and having fun with her son. Her reaction on Shen Yichong’s disappearance and a sudden trip had been amusing. That was what distinguished her from wives of the other two families. While they had been determined to win this game, Yu Yaoyao was excited more for the trip than the game. Zhao Yu wondered how bland the remaining broadcast would be if Yu yaoyao recognized Shen Yichong right now.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao provided the most entertainment value to the broadcast. Director Zhao Yu couldn’t afford to have her finish the game so quickly. But Shen Yichong had unfastened his seat belt and was surprised to see a hand blocking his path down the aisle.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on! At least let me go to the washroom,” said Shen Yichong disbelievingly.</p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu took a deep breath. “Okay. But Mr. Shen, promise me you will walk down to the washroom and come back here, nothing else. You can’t interact with anyone. Can you do that?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” nodded Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu watched him nervously as he left his seat and walked down the aisle. He wanted to lean sideways and watch him all the way, but if Yu Yaoyao noticed him, she would automatically know that Shen Yichong was here. He lowered his hat and straightened his fake beard. He gestured to the cameraman, who had been hiding in the innermost row, to not follow Shen Yichong to avoid being discovered. Director Zhao Yu was on high alert.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the live broadcast room had erupted in chaos. Shen Yichong’s cameraman had stopped recording. But Old Zheng, Yu Yaoyao’s cameraman, was still shooting openly, focusing on the mother and the son. Even so, there was a portly man visible at the side. The viewers were practically going crazy as they realized that this was the disguised Shen Yichong passing so close by Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wrapped her hands around Little Bun and covered him with a blanket. Her head tilted towards him. The plane had finally taken off. She had finished shooting a jump scene recently, which had left her reeling. She was naturally terrified of heights. So, she closed her eyes as the plane flew higher. She was so queasy that she even forgot about her snacks. After the plane stabled, she relaxed. She felt exhausted. The day’s events and the fatigue of waking up early had finally worn her out. She leaned towards Little Bun and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The audience however weren’t so relaxed. In fact, if they could, they would scream at her from their screens. They could see that Shen Yichong was approaching Yu Yaoyao. As he reached her, he began to slow down. It was clear that he wanted her to know that it was him. The viewers felt sentimental at this scene and a flood of comments overflowed the live broadcast:</p>
<p><strong>[Wow! Mr. Shen is chasing after his wife!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I want to chase after this couple! So full of love!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen is pleading silently for her to wake up!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen looks so different. Will she recognize him, though?]</strong></p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao was too exhausted. She perked her lips, seemingly lost in her sleep. Shen Yichong passed by and the people watching the live broadcast wailed.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sensed something and woke up. She squinted her eyes, trying to brush the sleepiness off. She muttered, half asleep, “Honey?” She rubbed her eyes and jolted awake. “Shen Yichong…,” she called out. The camera shook a little. Cameraman Zheng was terrified.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, still rubbing her eyes, looked down the aisle behind her. She was confused. She felt sure that Shen Yichong had just walked past the aisle. But she hadn’t seen him anywhere in the plane! The viewers were anxious and full of torment:</p>
<p><strong>[Did she see?!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Did she see her husband?!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Did YY recognize him?!]</strong></p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu, desperate to know, had whipped out a pocket mirror and watched everything in the reflection. He nearly wept from nervousness. Old Zheng shifted the camera to film down the aisle as well, following Yu Yaoyao’s gaze. Time seemed to have stood still, and everybody forgot to breath.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao yawned and seemed to have convinced herself that nothing was amiss. Everyone who had been glued to the screen of their devices sighed in disappointment. Director Zhao heaved a sigh of relief, but it was too soon. Yu Yaoyao unclasped her seat belt and stood up. “Brother Zheng, can you watch over Little Bun? I want to go to the washroom for a while,” she said.</p>
<p>Director Zhao and Old Zheng were speechless. Yu Yaoyao grabbed the thermos cup and took a swig. She glanced at the seat next to her and saw that Little Bun was waking up. She leaned over and patted him on the head. “Baby, mommy is just going to the washroom for a minute, alright? You sit here and stay put. I will be back soon.”</p>
<p>Little Bun nodded. Yu Yaoyao turned to go. The cameraman followed her. “Brother Zheng, do you have to film me in the washroom too?” asked Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Old Zheng was embarrassed. If he stayed there, Yu Yaoyao might stumble upon her husband and he would be unable to film it. But he didn’t know how to respond.</p>
<p>“I asked you to look after Little Bun while I am gone,” she continued, “Is there any particular reason that you must insist on following me?” She noticed his fidgety demeanor and raised an eyebrow. “Is there something I should be made aware of?” she asked, “I won’t be gone long. It’s just a short walk to the washroom. What’s going to happen?”</p>
