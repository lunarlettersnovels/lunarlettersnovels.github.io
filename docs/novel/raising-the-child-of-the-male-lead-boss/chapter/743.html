            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 8 – She Wants This Little Child (2)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao briefly closed her eyes, narrowing them only a crack.</p>
<p>The small, steamed stuffed bun glanced at her and finding out that she didn’t wake up, immediately breathed a sigh of relief. But not for long, he wrinkled his delicate eyebrows, stretching out his soft, short and white hands to gently wipe the tears that fell on the back of her hand.</p>
<p>But after one swipe, he was shocked to find his own hands became wet. And even after wiping her hand in panic, both their skin were now drenched in tears. Immediately, the face of the small steamed stuffed bun was completely flustered.</p>
<p><i>Ah! Where did this little guy come from…?</i></p>
<p>From beneath the quilt, Yu Yaoyao’s eyes were shining brightly.</p>
<p>Whenever she was bored in the zoo, she loved to amuse all kinds of little babies. Since she didn’t have her own, she could only play with others.</p>
<p>While looking at the little steamed stuffed bun who was stuck with panic and anxiety, her heart softened unconsciously. As he raised his tiny buttocks in a desperate effort to reach for paper towels that were out of reach, she secretly rubbed the back of her hand against the mattress to dry it.</p>
<p>Finally, having been able to take a tissue out, the little steamed stuffed bun came back to her side. Seeing her dry hand he looked stunned, but he quickly wiped his white and tender little face cleverly.</p>
<p>He secretly looked at Yu Yaoyao again, as if to make sure she was asleep.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao closed her eyes fast.</p>
<p><i>Was this the original owner and Shen Yichong’s son, Shen Rui, who is approaching his fifth birthday? This little cutie… he was so lovely it melted her, a snake’s heart, ah! Uwu!!!!!</i></p>
<p><i>Why so cute?!</i></p>
<p>After listening to Yu Yaoyao’s instigations, Shen Yichong had decided that he would not let their son go with her after the divorce was pushed through.</p>
<p>It is better for her not to cultivate feelings with her son in the beginning and later let him feel heartache once they became separated. So after weaning her child, she gave him to the nanny’s care. She hardly paid any attention to him and even seldom talked to her child at home.</p>
<p><i>This poor pup!</i></p>
<p>When she closed her eyes to think, she felt the quilt on her stomach suddenly move, and followed by a light weight. She opened her eye a small crack and unexpectedly saw this little steamed stuffed bun’s face staring warily at her. Seeing that she had no response, he quickly put another small hand on her stomach.</p>
<p><i>What’s the little steamed stuffed bun doing? Yu Yaoyao wondered curiously.</i></p>
<p>Before long, she saw the little steamed stuffed bun’s hands and feet, carefully and gently climbed onto the bed. He slowly placed his own messy, little black head on her stomach, rubbing it.</p>
<p>His whole face splayed across the quilt, he stuck to her.</p>
<p>Seeing that her eyes were still closed, the little steamed stuffed bun seems to finally feel at rest. From this comfortable position, a happy voice unconsciously came out from his mouth as his small hands firmly grasped the quilt.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, lying peacefully in her arms.</p>
<p>He was wrapped around her like a cub who had just come into the world and was afraid of being carried away by a fierce eagle.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s heart instantly turned into water.</p>
<p>It was mentioned in the novel that the steamed stuffed bun wanted to be close to his mother when he was young, and even cried for his mother to hug him, but the original owner would push him away and even scold him loudly.</p>
<p>Over time, the child was so afraid of his own mother that he dared not approach her at all.</p>
<p>But still, the little steamed stuffed bun wants his mother. Day by day, he has been approaching her silently and secretly.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt tender pain assault her heart.</p>
<p>The tense body of the steamed bun relaxed slowly over time, and she could see that he had climbed atop her without any shoes on his feet.</p>
<p>In the room, beside her big bed, was a temporary small bed for children with a blue duckling embroidered on the quilt.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao slightly pursed her lips. Her fingers were twitching; she wanted to touch the small feet of the steamed bun.</p>
<p>But just then, the door to the ward was suddenly opened.</p>
