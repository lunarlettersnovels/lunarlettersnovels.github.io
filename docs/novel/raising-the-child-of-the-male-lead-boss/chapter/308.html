            <p><strong>Chapter 455</strong></p>
<p>Ye Yun never imagined that one day she would be so close to her idol…!</p>
<p>She was no longer a little girl. She had become a fan that was rational and reasonable. Unlike the younger girls in the fan group, she had never fantasized about being Yaoyao’s assistant or manager after graduating from college. She knew that several girls in the group had always criticized Yaoyao’s manager, Ni Yi, and thought that they could definitely do much better than Ni Yi.</p>
<p>But she was never interested to read or know about these discussions just because they were too irrational. To her, star chasing was only for leisure, entertainment, and spiritual distress. Work, on the other hand, should be separated from interest.</p>
<p>However, she did not expect that she would be slapped by reality so quickly.</p>
<p>When she was on the way to Yu Yaoyao’s house in Chen Lin’s car, Ye Yun didn’t even know where to put her hands. She even exclaimed after looking at herself through the rear-view mirror in the car.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Chen Lin glanced at her.</p>
<p>The boss was in a meeting. While he took some time out to send her there, he would also have to return to the company soon.</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s face was a little red, “Well…it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>She was out today to meet Shen Yichong, who was her future boss and her idol’s husband! Therefore, she dressed herself with the standard of an office lady. The colours of her outfit were white and navy blue, and even the high heels on her feet were black. Her makeup was even more low-key. She put on nude makeup that wouldn’t catch any attention and bean paste-coloured lipstick to enhance her vitality.</p>
<p>However, if she were to go meet Yaoyao now, …</p>
<p>Ye Yun looked at the mirror carefully. The lipstick seems to have faded a lot after drinking coffee just now. A touch-up was needed. The base makeup had also fallen off. Oops, even acne marks and dark circles could be seen. A touch-up was definitely needed.</p>
<p>And also, the outfit was so plain. If she knew it earlier, she would have worn a small brooch regardless. Her navy-blue dark suit should also be changed to a more friendly and soft knitted jacket!</p>
<p>Ye Yun sighed as her heart beat faster, and she was becoming more nervous. While she could immediately touch-up on her makeup, she couldn’t do anything else for her outfit.</p>
<p>She wondered if Yaoyao would have a profound first impression of her? Would she like her?</p>
<p>As Ye Yun thought, she no longer had the mood to look at the scenery outside the window, “Sir, what does Yaoyao like? For my first visit, do I have to bring a gift? By the way, does she know that I am coming? Am I disturbing her rest? Also, what kind of problems is she facing recently? Can you tell me so I can prepare in advance?”</p>
<p>She was feeling more nervous than during her job interview. Instead of feeling nervous, she only wanted to gossip when she met Shen Yichong. But now, her heartbeat was estimated to be over 120 per minute!</p>
<p>What if she couldn’t help Yaoyao with her problem? Would she be disappointed in her and felt that she was useless?</p>
<p>Aaaah! Ye Yun felt that her heart was about to jump out of her throat!</p>
<p>“By the way, is there anything she hates very much? Is there anything I need to pay attention to when I talk later?”</p>
<p>Was she heading to her duplex villa that she had seen in ‘My Wife and I’? Would Little Bun be there? She didn’t bring any gifts for the kid! She didn’t even have candy with her. Ah! She didn’t even buy the pudding that Yaoyao liked!</p>
<p>Chen Lin turned the steering wheel and glanced at the co-pilot next to him. “Relax, the lady boss doesn’t eat people.”</p>
<p>However, Ye Yun was not comforted at all.</p>
<p>Chen Lin couldn’t help laughing, “How long have you been a fan of our lady boss? As a fan, you should know the personality of our lady boss very well. She has a very good temper and is very friendly to people. As long as you don’t provoke her, she is a very nice person.”</p>
<p>To tell the truth, the lady boss was simply an angel, compared to the boss himself.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be nervous at all,” Chen Lin said, “As for the problem that needs your help, the boss didn’t tell me in detail since he was rushing for a meeting. You can ask the lady boss later.”</p>
<p>Chen Lin was also a very gentle person. But Ye Yun became even more nervous after hearing this.</p>
<p>Most celebrities had a character set up by the company that they had to follow. The character would be designed by adding the artist’s own personality and the company’s marketing plan for the artist.</p>
<p>She, as a rational fan, used to think that Yaoyao was a true temperament. But now that she was no longer a little girl and had started working, she had long known that whether it was people in the entertainment industry or people outside the industry, everyone had many facets.</p>
<p>No one can be extremely naive. The impression that Yaoyao left on everyone was at most one side, and the other sides of hers were invisible to fans. Nobody can be perfect.</p>
<p>It was just that the distance had created beauty. Yaoyao might not be as perfect as the fans had imagined.</p>
<p>The closer she was to the truth, the more fear she felt.</p>
<p>As an old fan, she was also very worried that her idol image in her heart would collapse. In this way, she would be sad too. Under the many worries she had, it was natural that she was becoming more and more nervous.</p>
<p>“We’re here,” Chen Lin announced. He then stopped the car and led her to a small villa to ring the doorbell.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to leave after introducing you to our lady boss. Once you’re done, you can take a taxi home yourself. The company can reimburse you for the fare.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun followed his steps while nodding stiffly. Her breathing halted the moment the door opened. While she looked nervously at the interior, she could only see a porch that was empty. The white-painted home, decorated with green vines, looked very open and elegant. The strong homey ambiance also made her feel a little more relaxed.</p>
<p>When she looked down she saw a round and bright yellow dinosaur with horns and a long tail dragging on the ground.</p>
<p>“Hello, Uncle Lin. Hello, auntie~” The childish voice was loud and clear. A fair and tender face, big, watery black eyes, and a pair of pink and tender lips…</p>
<p>Ye Yun took a step back while clutching her chest! Little Bun! Gosh, her blood tank was already half empty when she had just entered the house!</p>
<p>Although she was unmarried and had no children, she was still fond of children. Seeing such a cute child, she couldn’t help but want to hold him in her arms! After watching a lot of Yu Yaoyao’s variety shows, Ye Yun had long fallen for Shen Rui. She didn’t expect today would come so fast!</p>
