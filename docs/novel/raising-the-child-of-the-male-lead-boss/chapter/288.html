            <p><strong>Chapter 475</strong></p>
<p>“Darling, my back is so sore! I didn’t know mopping the floor could be so tiring!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who had never done housework before, quickly got tired in front of the camera. She draped her body on Shen Yichong, her face pale.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong immediately put his hand on her waist and whispered, “You go rest. Go lie down on the sofa for a while.”</p>
<p>Little Bun also nervously held the small rag and poked his head, “Mommy, you rest, don’t work. Leave it to daddy and I!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was a little listless, “Then you’ll be too tired.”</p>
<p>In order to do this episode of them really welcoming guests, she invited the housekeeper and maid to rest on the second floor. Except for the nanny who took care of Little Sweetheart, everyone else wason vacleaveation.</p>
<p>She wanted to try being  a housewife, but pain in her waist kicked in before she was even successful. She would feel bad if the father and son worked while she was laying down.</p>
<p>“Mommy, it’s okay. You need to keep your strength and study hard later.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui thoughtfully put away the rag on the table and helped her rub her lower back. Although he didn’t know if he was rubbing on the right spot, his expression was very serious.</p>
<p>“Did your waist get tired after giving birth to my little sister?” he said. “Mommy, you’ll be fine after I massage and blow some air on it!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao glanced at Little Bun lovingly, “Yup, Mommy will be fine in a minute. Thank you, my baby.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong picked up the rag that was put aside by Little Bun and devoted himself to the cleaning work..</p>
<p>“Darling, our house is so big that we can’t even clean it by ourselves.” Yu Yaoyao let out a long groan. “Let’s buy a smaller house in the future.”</p>
<p>Her vulnerable appearance was seen in the  live broadcast. Although the general audience would usually criticize artists who behaved like this, that didn’t happen today. Most of the audience today were Yaoyao’s fans, while the others were fans who learned about the show from the hot searches.</p>
<p>Who was Yaoyao?</p>
<p>She was the woman on set who even snatched the recliner from the director! She had to lie down because her feet would feel sore after standing only for a while. She was indeed squeamish. However, she got to be that way all because of what she could bring to the table! Therefore, not only was she not criticized when she grumbled about her sore back in front of the camera, she even got praised for her true temperament.</p>
<p>Director Zhao, who was watching from the side, was really impressed. If it was another female artist, he guaranteed that she would be scolded so badly. Even Chen Jiao got scolded when he was a little slow at work last time.</p>
<p>Director Zhao felt that Yu Yaoyao’s success was a model for female artists to learn from. Unfortunately, there was no one who could really learn from her. If they were to lie down and act like a spoiled child, like Yu Yaoyao, they would definitely be criticized. There was no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Director Zhao’s thoughts drifted away, but soon, he showed an indescribable expression after glancing at the comments of the live broadcast.</p>
<p><em>[I think she might have hurt her lumbar nerve when she gave birth to her child. It’s better that she just lies down! My poor Yaoyao~]</em></p>
<p><em>[She even had to film action scenes when she was pregnant…She might have gotten injured from there? We already always had sore legs from standing too long, I wonder how uncomfortable she could have felt…]</em></p>
<p><em>[I hope she takes a lot of rest, she still needs to hold Little Sweetheart in the future.]</em></p>
<p>Looking at these heart-warming comments, Director Zhao really felt sad for the other female artists. It was really maddening to compare people to people.</p>
<p>While Shen Yichong took care of all the housework alone, Little Bun gave Yu Yaoyao a massage on the sofa. Yu Yaoyao also didn’t forget to memorize the English vocabulary from the elementary school textbook. She would also ask Little Bun from time to time when she encountered things she couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>“Don’t read a book lying down.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong finally finished mopping the floor. When he returned to the living room, he frowned a little when he saw Yu Yaoyao reading the book while lying down. He stretched out his hand to pull down the slightly wrinkled skirt around her knees. Then, he covered her with the small blanket on the sofa next to her.</p>
<p>“Then, you should read to me, darling~”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t reject the small blanket. Instead, she rolled half a circle from the sofa to Shen Yichong and held her hand high. Shen Yichong lowered his eyes, held her soft white hand carefully and kissed it.</p>
<p>“We’ll read it when your teacher comes,” he said softly. “Lie down for a while if you feel uncomfortable.”</p>
<p><em>[This unexpected love in the air!]</em></p>
<p><em>[How did I forget this! It’s been so long since I last saw them stay sweet in front of the camera. I almost got diabetes from the sweetness!]</em></p>
<p>“You should rest hard when you have studied hard,” he continued. He took away the English book and placed it on the coffee table where she couldn’t reach.</p>
<p>“Darling, I just found out that learning a language is very difficult. I don’t even know how I learned it back then, I’m so amazing!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao kicked with her legs.  As a result, her feet were also grabbed by Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“You didn’t even wear socks?” His face suddenly turned black.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stuck out her tongue, “It’s a little hot doing housework~”</p>
<p>The next second, he pressed down her feet and put socks on them for her.</p>
<p>“Awww! What a gangster!” Yu Yaoyao raised her head and muttered in  a soft voice.</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room immediately let out an excited scream. Everyone almost died of nosebleeds.</p>
