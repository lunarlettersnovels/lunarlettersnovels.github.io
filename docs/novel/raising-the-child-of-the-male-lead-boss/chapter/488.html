<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 275 – Growth of An Actress (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>“Ow!” Zhao Yu cried, shaking and wiping his hands. The hot tea had almost scalded his skin. He had especially given her a holiday! <em>Why in hell would she want to help other families? </em>Zhao Yu wondered, frustrated.</p>
<p>She had seemed to be content with her husband for a while, eating breakfast in bed and interacting with her family. But now, she wanted to help other families. <em>Honestly, what goes on in the mind of this woman?</em></p>
<p>It was terrible news for the staff, the crew, and the director. If she intended to go on with her outrageous idea, he would have to think of something fast to stop her, somehow. Fortunately, Director Zhao saw Ni Yi rush to Yu Yaoyao to discuss something. Ni Yi seriously was a saving grace. He wasn’t paid nearly enough to put up with this.</p>
<p>“Sis, there is something more urgent for you to attend to,” said Ni Yi, interrupting Yu Yaoyao, “Director Li Bo has recommended you for a role in Director Li guiding Qi Hang’s literary film about family ethics! He called last night and Director Qi Hang reached out to me this morning for a chat with you. He wants to discuss and arrange a small video audition. I came to inform you as soon as the call ended, but you were asleep.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was holding Shen Rui in her arms. She had thought of convincing Shen Yichong and helping other families. But now she felt distracted by this news. “Family ethics?” she inquired. She rarely watched movies of that genre because she disliked how the heroines in such movie felt so miserable, dominated by their mother-in-law and such.</p>
<p>“Yes,” began Ni Yi, “It is supposed to be a story of a wife who cheats on her husband. She belongs to a rich family. But Director Li assured me that the character is likeable, and many would relate to her plight. It will be good for your prospects in acting.”</p>
<p>Literary films were a good way to bump up one’s popularity in the film industry. Unlike commercial films, important characters in literary films had more fan following and were harder to perform. Usually, the person playing a character invested a lot of time and psychological effort in understanding the character. It was a good learning ground for versatile acting. It gave the film critics and the viewers something deeper to analyze.</p>
<p>“Will she be playing the second lead?” Shen Yichong asked with a raised eyebrow. Apparently, he knew a bit about it.</p>
<p>“Yes, boss,” said Ni Yi, “Both female leads and the male lead will supposedly be played by talented actors who aren’t highly popular. They wanted fresh faces for this movie, and they are aiming to win some big awards.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s face lit up. This will be one step closer to her dream of winning the Best Actress Award. She loved nothing more than acting. Yu Yaoyao touched her cheek. “Why is this character so miserable, though?” she asked, reading the character sketch that was handed to her. “Will I really be able to portray this character? I have never played anyone so miserable before.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong reached out a hand and stroked her hair. “You will be fine,” he said, “There will be make-up artists and a character design team at the shoot. Besides, you have played so many characters exceptionally well. This role might be a big challenge for you, but I have full confidence that you can pull it off. You have played formidable, beautiful women until now who seemed exaggerated and removed from reality. This will be something different, and closer to the real lives of many people. The second female lead seems to undoubtedly reflect the pain and helplessness of perhaps many housewives. You could portray the inner crisis they face in day-to-day life.”</p>
<p>“Just like you changed yourself to deceive me in the show,” she teased, “But I still recognized your scent.” She smiled and looked at Ni Yi. “I will give it a go,” she said, “If the director has faith in me then I am up to a challenge to play a different kind of character for a change. Ni Yi, please call and relay my message to the director.” With Shen Rui in her arms, she turned to Shen Yichong and threw herself into his arms. “Hubby, let’s go out today!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi hesitated, but couldn’t keep quiet any longer. “But sis, don’t you want to practice for the video audition?” he asked, “In case the director calls later.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui raised his little hand. “Uncle Ni Yi, mommy is on vacation,” he said, “Can’t we have fun for a little while? If uncle director calls, then you can call mommy for work again. Please?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was speechless. Shen Yichong tried to hold in his smile. “We will just be awhile, Ni Yi,” he said to Yu Yaoyao’s assistant. He looked at her, still in her pajamas. “Change first,” he said, “Then we will go out for a while.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui both cheered. Her cheers were cut short as she realized she had forgotten to pack clothes for herself and Little Bun. “Oh my god, I didn’t bring any clothes!” she turned to Shen Yichong, “I didn’t pack clothes for the both of us.” She looked at Shen Rui, still wearing yesterday’s attire, and felt miserable. Yu Yaoyao wasn’t really a germophobe, but wearing the same clothes for the whole day and sleeping in them didn’t really sound hygienic.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stroked her hair. “Go look in the closet,” he said, smiling. “Shen Rui, you too! That onsie is covered in sweat and food stains.” In all the excitement, Shen Rui had forgotten to fret over them.</p>
