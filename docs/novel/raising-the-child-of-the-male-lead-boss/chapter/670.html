            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 81 – Brushing a Favorable Impression (2)</strong></p>
<p>This word which lightly reverberated across the room, was enough to make the audience burst into laughter. And staff who where preparing to take control were also stunned. The on-site director quickly pointed the camera at Yu Yaoyao, and also prompted the host to speak a few more words to her though the headset.</p>
<p>After the host was notified, he naturally had to ask more questions.</p>
<p>But who would have thought that the new Yu Yaoyao never actually had the chance to interact with so many people? Unlike rabbits or alpacas, snakes looked frightening, cold-blooded reptiles. So, she could only interact with tourists to feed.</p>
<p>The underlying interaction factor in her body is already in a hellish mood. The moment she heard everyone laugh as soon as she opened her mouth, she tasted the sweetness—and now she couldn’t stop!</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped. I’ve been so charmed by my loving husband—my single, unmarried brothers and sisters obviously can’t relate.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hasn’t forgotten her main task: brush a favorable impression on Shen Yichong to obtain his affection!</p>
<p>“Only when one understands love and are loved in return become…extremely more beautiful.”</p>
<p>The host was still listening to his earpiece: “Then your acting skills…”</p>
<p>Looking towards the camera, Yu Yaoyao gracefully swept her hair back to reveal her attractive, thin, swan-like neck. Her red lips pressed to a line, and her lovely face showed a dejected expression. And in the next second, she lifted it up, her sad expression was brimming towards weeping.</p>
<p>“When I think of disfigurement—for the world to lose a beauty like me, that it becomes incomplete and ugly, I cannot breathe; my chest just becomes stuffy at the mere, painful thought of this. And sadly… I wish I would be born again if that were to happen…”</p>
<p>The whole audience became foolish hearing this. But she covered her face then and sobbed with a more mournful look. “And the thought of my husband seeing an imperfect me, breaks my heart to a million pieces… and my little baby, if he sees his mommy become so ugly, he’ll be driven to horrified tears…!”</p>
<p>This time, even the host was dumbfounded. <em>Is she acting again?</em> He could only think in stupor.</p>
<p>“But that’s merely for my acting topic.” Yu Yaoyao gave a sad and tragic nod and proceeded to wipe her tears. His lips then stretched to a fake and forceful smile.</p>
<p>“Despite my lack of acting skills, everything that has driven me to this point—can only be attributed to love. And also, because I value highly my appearance.” As she said this, there was a hint of shyness in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Without my husband, my performance today would have been impossible. And to my baby, mommy loves you forever.” She finally stretched out her hand to the camera, making a finger heart.</p>
<p>Happiness and grief—Yu Yaoyao switched between these two moods like lightning in just seconds!</p>
<p>Below, the audience had just began to boo, and then were laughing, but their laughter was soon stopped halfway. At the very end, only amazement was left in their eyes. Even the judges at this moment all wore mixed expressions of laughter and crying on their faces.</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao stepped down from the platform, Ni Yi couldn’t find the words to say anything. But deep in his heart, he really admires his sister.</p>
<p>At the backstage, Yu Yaoyao’s smile disappeared after she passed Meng Xinran’s small group, and she halted on the spot.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the good Samaritan who helped me—breaking the mirror had given me a truly, <em>big</em> inspiration. I can’t thank you enough.”</p>
<p>She uttered these provocative lines from memories of the TV shows she has watched.</p>
<p>“A pity that I don’t know the name of this kind person. Otherwise, I would have asked my husband to give her a limited-edition bag as my ultimate thanks.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s teeth felt like they were breaking as she gritted them forcefully. And the girls who surrounded her, who had said that Yu Yaoyao would definitely be eliminated, now all look terrible.</p>
<p>Ni Yi, also walking behind her, felt cool air breeze through him. Looking at these harlots’ ugly expressions, it made him feel as if he was having a glass of ice-cold Cola on a hot summer day, completely refreshed from head to foot.</p>
<p>“There are still more rounds to go and a lot of off-site voting–today is still not the final result!”</p>
<p>It was unknown who uttered the next words provokingly, “Maybe you’ll even end up at the bottom.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled and bravely opened her red lips to a vicious grin. “Well, thanks for reminding me. I will ask my golden thigh daddy to forward it for me and harvest tickets.”</p>
<p>“… ”</p>
<p>They were all so angry that they vomited blood. She has the support of a sponsor and her CEO husband of an entertainment company, and how many of them could have this treatment?</p>
<p>Envy truly drives a person mad like crazy!</p>
