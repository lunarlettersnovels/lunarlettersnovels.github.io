            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 14 – Let The Director Become A Little Clear-Headed (2)</strong></p>
<p>She looked at Mama Xu, finding her pleasing to the eyes. Luckily, the original owner was actually very picky with her food and actually tried to fire Mama Xu.</p>
<p><i>This is simply food of immortals, how could the original owner bear to part with it!?</i></p>
<p>Mama Xu absentmindedly wiped the grease from the little bun’s mouth.</p>
<p>And the little bun, also sitting next to Yu Yaoyao, looked at his mother. His small eyes were looking at her in amazement, with the hint of reverence.</p>
<p><i>Mom, is it really that delicious? Why are you eating so fast? </i>He could only wonder.</p>
<p>He decisively took his fork, stuffed it with chicken noodles, and ate all the shredded carrots he didn’t like to eat before. Soon, his little bowl was clean.</p>
<p>“Oh, our baby has a good appetite today. Keep it up!”</p>
<p>The little bun immediately bowed his head shyly. In the next second, he slid down the stool, wore his slippers, and fled hastily from the room.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao: “…”</p>
<p><i>Is she that scary?</i></p>
<p>As soon as the little bun left, the white, fat man, who had been waiting by the side for some time, anxiously jumped to his feet and came up to her with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Sister, what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“I just went on vacation. How could you almost kill yourself and have an affair? A journalist sent me a private message with hard evidence telling me you had an affair? Is it true?” He rambled.</p>
<p>The room was clearly air-conditioned, but the white, fat man’s forehead was sweating all over and was busily wiping it off with a tissue.</p>
<p>He was dressed in a pullover, and one could see a dark sweat stain forming in the middle of his shirt.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao squinted her eyes—this was the original owner’s manager, Ni Yi.</p>
<p>This person wasn’t bad, only, their agency didn’t have many resources at hand. Therefore, they had been stuck at the bottom of the entertainment industry for several years now.</p>
<p>He has the disposition of an anxious mother: fat, worrisome, easily excited, sometimes angry, and when he was anxious, he was always covered in sweat.</p>
<p>During her pregnancy, he became the manager of two other celebrities from the internet. But one was an irate person and the other had no talent. It was a mess and in the end, they had all been canceled.</p>
<p>This time Yu Yaoyao was involved in another scandal, and he was truly in a hurry to settle things. Even if she is currently only a third-rate celebrity with poor acting skills, shooting TV shows with less than 5-star ratings, this was all right!</p>
<p>A cheating scandal was easier to diffuse.</p>
<p>“Sister, if you do that again, I’m really going to get fired!” Ni Yi wanted to cry.</p>
<p>He glanced at Mama Xu in the kitchen and lowered his voice. “The reporter asked for $5 million in exchange and he promised not to expose you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao laughed and said, “Who’s afraid? We won’t give it!”</p>
<p>“What are you being so fearless for? Sister, the auditions I got for you are all going to be canceled! We’ll be done for!”</p>
<p>The curving corners of Yu Yaoyao’s mouth stiffened in an instant. She searched for the memories of the original owner and immediately found that there were several plays she had auditioned for, and one was scheduled this week.</p>
<p>“There is also the scheduled role for the ‘Golden Age Empress’ and Director Li Bo has gone back on his word.”</p>
<p>“What?!” Yu Yaoyao’s present situation was bad!</p>
<p>Her biggest dream was to act. Now that she had finally transmigrated into the body of a small celebrity, how come all of her projects are slipping through her fingers one by one? The original owner couldn’t act for medical reasons, but she’s out of the hospital now!</p>
<p>“I didn’t kill myself. I just clarified that on Weibo. Didn’t you see that Little Yiyi?”</p>
