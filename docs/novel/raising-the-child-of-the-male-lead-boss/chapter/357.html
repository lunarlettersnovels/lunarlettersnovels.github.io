            <p><strong>Chapter 406</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, I never could have expected something like this from you. You rarely smile or talk, but you became a slave to your wife the second you got home.” Lu Cheng felt ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>Wei Ming also smiled bitterly. “I don’t think my wife should watch this show, otherwise she is going to start nagging me the second I get home.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised one eyebrow in greeting. “I’ll go make dinner. You guys talk.”</p>
<p>His wife had already said she was hungry. He turned and went to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Lu Cheng and Wei Ming looked at each other and smiled. They didn’t mind. Afterall, with so many people to make dinner for there was no time for Mr. Shen to sit and chat.</p>
<p>The two of them sat comfortably on the sofa, ready to make a few jokes with Yu Yaoyao. But it wasn’t long until Little Bun stopped feeding his mother cherry tomatoes just long enough to lecture them.</p>
<p>“Uncles, are you here on vacation?”</p>
<p>Wei Ming smiled and touched his head. “We’re here to rest, and just like your mom, for work.”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng also leaned back happily against the sofa. “I’m here to breathe some fresh air. This is the most comfortable work schedule I’ve ever had.”</p>
<p>Little Bun nodded. “I see. Uncles, if you’re working, you should be doing something. Daddy said if you don’t work hard, you won’t have a job, and you won’t be able to eat.”</p>
<p>Both the men were quite surprised.</p>
<p>Little Bun stopped feeding Yu Yaoyao, turned, and slid off the sofa. Then he went to the bathroom and brought out a mop and a rag. “Uncles, each of us has a task. I’m in charge of taking care of Mommy. My daddy is responsible for groceries and cooking. The guest is responsible for cleaning, washing dishes, and other chores.”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng opened his mouth and looked at Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>But Little Bun already answered him before he even asked. “My mommy is responsible for lying down.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised a hand and waved at them. “Good luck and have fun.”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng and Wei Meng were soon holding handfuls of tools.</p>
<p>“Uncles, do get started. We’ll have dinner at 5 o’clock. I won’t ask you to pay for food if you clean up the house,” Little Bun said.</p>
<p>Wei Ming and Lu Cheng had no choice but to start their tasks under the watchful eyes of Little Bun, and Yu Yaoyao’s wide grin.</p>
<p>Little Bun gave instructions while feeding his mother. “Uncle Wei, make sure the corners are clean. The dust will make my mommy sneeze. Uncle Lu, take the things off the table before you wipe. Don’t break things. The noise will scare my mommy.”</p>
<p>The live broadcast room was full of laughter.</p>
<p><em>[Poor Lu Cheng. He just wanted to relax… Hahahaha!]</em></p>
<p><em>[My baby Bun is really cracking me up!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Wei Ming: I lie around at home, but I must do housework when I’m away from home? Well, my wife definitely can’t see this!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Little Bun: It’s impossible for my mommy to do housework. Absolutely impossible!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao really is the happiest wife I’ve ever seen. I hope she’ll always be this happy!]</em></p>
<p>There were also some keyboard warriors in the comment section. How could married couples get along like this? They argued that it was impossible that only one party did the housework. But their opinions were soon drowned out by the words and thoughts of others.</p>
<p>For dinner, Shen Yichong pan fried a steak. He carefully cut it into bite sized pieces with a knife and fork. He gave Yu Yaoyao each piece, letting her taste it and taking it away if she didn’t like it. He even cut the cherry tomatoes on the dining table into bunny shapes, and the cucumber into flowers. He peeled the shrimp and removed the bones from the steamed fish before he served it to her.</p>
<p>At Wei Ming and Lu Cheng’s table was rice, cucumbers, tomato scrambled eggs, tomato egg soup, steak Yu Yaoyao didn’t want and a mess of fish and shrimp. The difference between the two tables was shocking.</p>
<p>“Let’s eat, uncles.” Little Bun speared a shrimp with his small fork, awkwardly peeled it and stuffed it into his mouth. “You’re eating the same thing as my daddy. Don’t be sad.”</p>
<p>Wei Ming and Lu Cheng remained silent with shock.</p>
<p>After Little Bun’s lectures, Lu Cheng was forced to wash the dinner dishes.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong went to the room to take a video call for a work conference.</p>
<p>This left Wei Ming in the living room with Yu Yaoyao and her son.</p>
<p>Little Bun was earnestly holding a storybook and reading it word for word.</p>
<p>Wei Ming was assigned a high-level task; to chat with his mommy so she wouldn’t be bored. “Uncle, according to the rules for men in my family, this time of the day is the time for my daddy to make Mommy happy. Since Daddy is not around now, this glorious task falls to you.”</p>
<p>Wei Ming, blinked in surprise.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was laying on the sofa, hugging a big pillow and looking up at him expectantly. “It’s okay, you can talk to me about anything. Is there any gossip about your new crew?”</p>
<p>Wei Ming was very out of his comfort zone. As a man who was easily distressed by merely playing games, and who rarely chatted with his wife for long, this half an hour conversation burned out all his brain cells.</p>
<p>Now, Wei Ming suddenly felt he had to reflect on himself. The more he spoke, the more ashamed he felt.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao on the other hand was getting more and more excited. After having rested at home for then half a month she was starting to remember her boring life in the zoo. But now that she was hearing this gossip from the industry, she was starting to feel excited again.</p>
<p>“Oh, I read on Weibo that he’s with Xiaohua, right? Some people say that this director is fierce, but he doesn’t know anything. Is it true?” she asked relentlessly.</p>
<p>Wei Ming was sweating by the time she had finished asking all her questions.</p>
<p>After racking his brain, he finally found another topic to take her attention away from the secrets of the industry. “Xiao Yu, Da Fu changed career paths and become a director. He’s planning to make a cute pet movie. Did you know that?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Da Fu? Are you referring to Xiao Sisi’s husband? A cute pet movie?” Yu Yaoyao’s eyes lit up, but she quickly shook her head in confusion. “I’ve never heard of this.”</p>
<p>“It seems that they’re facing some technical issues and funds have been blocked. The crew has made no preparations, even though they were formed more than half a year ago,” Wei Ming said with a worried expression.</p>
<p>“Xiao Sisi never mentioned this to me. What technical issues are they having?”</p>
<p>“Cute pets, especially cats and dogs, have a relatively high popularity. They found investors in the beginning, but they still haven’t found suitable animals. They’re planning to do it with computer animation and animatronics, but I heard the investors are withdrawing because of the high cost.” Wei Ming shrugged.</p>
<p>“Ah… They have no money?” Yu Yaoyao slowly relaxed her arms, and her small face bloomed with brilliance. “I have the money!”</p>
