            <p><strong>Chapter 426</strong></p>
<p>Under Yu Yaoyao’s calmness, the box office of ‘Year’ for the first week was released, which surprised everyone. It hit fifty million on the first day, ten million on the next day… the box office reached a total of 500 million in the first week, and the ranking rose directly to second place in the week!</p>
<p>The Douban score had also risen to 5 points. Many young white-collar workers were taking their mothers to watch it, and there were even many girl friends who went to the cinema to watch it together. The box office of the show was once again showing an upward trend day by day.</p>
<p>Many film critics and audiences gave the film high evaluation. Moreover, many people in the industry had also come to think that the timing of its release was a really very wise strategy.</p>
<p>Avoiding the golden period of summer simply meant they also avoided the competition with many great works during the same period. By choosing low-key September relative to the off-season of the market, they were directly targeting housewives who had become slightly idle as their children started school.</p>
<p>After the first week, the box office did not fall back in the second week. It stabilized at 500 million. In the third and fourth week, the heat began to cool down and the box office fell below 100 million. Even so, the box office in the first month was still very high.</p>
<p>At the same time, this September film was also nominated for the Hundred Flowers Award at the end of the month. It was nominated for a total of six awards, including Best Feature Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor, etc.!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was a little surprised when she got the news.</p>
<p>She received a notice from the organizing committee and the producer that not only was she nominated for best supporting actress under ‘Year’, her previous role in ‘Chaos’ was also nominated for the best rookie award.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know I was considered a rookie?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blinked.She couldn’t hide the smile from her face. Before, Meng Xinran always thought she was an old aunty. She laughed. Right. She was still young!</p>
<p>“You’re still considered a rookie.” Shen Yichong nodded without hesitation. “You would be eligible as long as you’ve debuted for less than 15 years and have only produced less than 3 film and television works.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao made her debut five years ago, and she had only played the role of a supporting actress in one movie. ‘Chaos’ five years later was her second one. Therefore, there was no problem that she was nominated for the rookie award for ‘Chaos’, and the best supporting actress awards for ‘Year’.</p>
<p>Even the head of Guangxin’s marketing department called Shen Yichong specifically for his feedback. He wanted to ask whether his lady boss’s role in ‘Year’ should be considered as the heroine, which was equivalent to having two female leads in ‘Year’. In that case, she would be able to run for the best leading actress for the year.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong did not agree. He had confidence in Yu Yaoyao and firmly believed that she would have a better chance at performing.</p>
<p>Moreover, he knew the temper of his wife. She regarded Cai Fang, who played the heroine, as her acting teacher. At that time, she had many questions about theoretical knowledge, and she always consulted Cai Fang when she had any doubts. Yu Yaoyao will not be willing to take away the halo of the heroine that belonged to Cai Fang.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong also didn’t want her to be criticized by the public saying that she was a betrayer. A supporting role meant a supporting role. She had what it took for a leading role, and she didn’t need him to do any petty action.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of his personal emotions… he also didn’t want his wife’s best leading actress award to come from a… divorce movie.</p>
<p>The Hundred Flowers Award would be held in the second half of the year. Even if Yu Yaoyao was nominated, she would not be able to participate. Just as Shen Yichong expected, Yu Yaoyao didn’t care if she would win any award. Compared to that, she was happier about the fact that she was nominated as a rookie. She had talked about it happily for several days.</p>
<p>Even Little Bun quickly learned that his mommy had won an award</p>
<p>“She was just nominated.” Shen Yichong corrected his son.</p>
<p>Little bun didn’t care, “Nominations are also considered awards. Mommy will also be shown on the big screen.. My mommy is the best.”</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he touched Yu Yaoyao’s big belly. Soon, he had his own conclusion, and he nodded.</p>
<p>“I think mommy will probably win the award. Everyone said a child’s hunch is very accurate.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at him, wondering where he heard that from. “Shen Rui, superstition is forbidden in our family.”</p>
<p>Although he was a businessman, he never believed in Feng Shui and fortune telling at all. Little Bun pouted. When Shen Yichong turned around and headed upstairs, he heard the voice of Little Bun from downstairs.</p>
<p>“Little baby sister, do you think I’m right or daddy’s right? I said that mommy will win the award. If you agree, you can move a little. If you think daddy’s right…”</p>
<p>Shen Yi Chong raised his eyebrows. He paused his steps and looked down. After a while, he saw his son lifting his bottom and putting his head on Yu Yaoyao’s belly.</p>
