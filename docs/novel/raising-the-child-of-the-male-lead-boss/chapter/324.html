            <p><strong>Chapter 439</strong></p>
<p>Ye Yun read the previous Weibo posts from ‘My wife is doing pretty good lately’ again.</p>
<p>She had not thought about this before, but the more she looked at it, the more she felt this person must be someone from the entertainment industry. Not only that, she was sure that he had a special relationship with Guangxin.</p>
<p>First of all, during Meng Xinran’s incident in the past, he even got the clips that were not released by the program group at that time.</p>
<p>Secondly, the time he and Chen Lin from Guangxin messaged her was almost back to back. As for who Chen Lin was, those who had watched the live broadcast from yesterday would definitely know. He was a personal assistant who had been by Shen Yichong’s side all the time!</p>
<p>Ye Yun exclaimed as she looked at the message from Chen Lin that invited her to join Guangxin.</p>
<p>She covered her mouth immediately .</p>
<p>“No way?” <em>‘My wife is doing pretty good lately’…this id…</em></p>
<p>They had always thought that this was just a low-key loyal fan of Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Loyal fans are usually in the group… but it seems that this person has only agreed to join us after being invited many times…” Ye Yun was reminiscing. “And he is not fanatical. I don’t usually see him liking the posts nor participating in any fan activities.”</p>
<p>It seemed like the truth would soon be revealed. Ye Yun asked a few college girls who had a lot of free time in the group, and she checked with them the live broadcast time of Yu Yaoyao’s show. After checking, the time seemed to have matched.</p>
<p>‘My wife is doing pretty good lately’ did not appear during Yu Yaoyao’s work time or live broadcast period. When Yu Yaoyao was being criticized by people saying that she was proud and have bad acting skill, he didn’t reply at night even after Ye Yun asked for his help…It seemed like that was also the time when Yu Yaoyao asked Mr. Shen to go to bed…</p>
<p>Could there really be such a coincidence?</p>
<p>Why would Chen Lin and Mr. Shen from Guangxin pay attention to her? How do they know about her Weibo? She was usually active in the fan group. If someone were to contact her, they would usually reach out to her via Tencent QQ.</p>
<p>‘My wife is doing pretty good lately’…was Mr. Shen?</p>
<p>Ye Yun gasped, thinking that this speculation of hers was too dreamy! But if this was really the case, it would all make sense!</p>
<p>This subsidiary account would always appear when Yaoyao was in trouble. Why did he not use his main account? That could only mean that the person’s true identity might be exposed if he were to use his main account!</p>
<p>This id owner also hardly spoke in the fan group. This time, he even sent such a big red envelope that was worth more than 50,000 Yuan, while saying, “Rejoicing With everyone”…Rejoicing what…? Usually, only the party directly involved in a celebration would speak like this!</p>
<p>Ye Yun picked up the water cup and had a sip. She was trembling a little.</p>
<p>After chasing Yu Yaoyao all the way, she also liked Little Bun, and slowly regarded Shen Yichong as a work target.</p>
<p>Guangxin’s success came after being very close to a failure. All these were inseparable from the courage and conspiracy of the boss. More importantly, he had so much time to accompany his wife and son every day, as if his work could simply be completed!</p>
<p>Speaking of success, this family was really a role model. Ye Yun had repeatedly developed admiration for the family. But she was chasing a star with reasons. She rarely visited the scene or bought any peripheral products. But little did she expect that she was so close to her idol!</p>
<p>She was even trembling a little when she clicked on the private chat with Chen Lin.</p>
<p><em>[Hello, may I ask why you invited me? Did you see my resume somewhere?]</em></p>
<p>After sending the message, she held her breath somewhat nervously.</p>
<p>As a special assistant, Chen Lin was indeed very professional in replying to the messages from all parties, and he replied in a timely manner.</p>
<p>After a while, a reply came in.</p>
<p><em>[Miss Ye, it is my boss who thinks highly of you. If you are interested in developing an entertainment career with Guangxin, we sincerely invite you to the company for an interview.]</em></p>
<p>The last time Ye Yun saw Chen Lin’s invitation, she directly replied ‘not considering it for now’. Now that she asked for more information, she was almost caught off guard! Chen Lin’s boss… wasn’t that Shen Yichong? He thought highly of her? This sounded too much!</p>
<p>Unless he was the owner of the subsidiary account ‘My wife is doing pretty good lately’, there was no chance for her to interact with himeract at all!</p>
<p>Ye Yun swallowed saliva and quickly typed again.</p>
<p><em>[Um, I can ask, does your boss have a subsidiary Weibo account?]</em></p>
<p>Once again, Chen Lin replied quickly.</p>
<p><em>[Sorry, I am not sure about this. If you are interested, you can come to Guangxin and chat with my boss and the president of the HR department. You may ask him in person.]</em></p>
<p>Ye Yun almost choked on her saliva!</p>
<p>In person! Chat with Mr. Shen in person! After she knew him, would she be able to meet Little Bun? Or even Yu Yaoyao? She might be able to see the family?!</p>
<p><em>‘Oh my</em>…’ Her heart thumped.</p>
<p>As a fan with reasons, she had never thought of interacting with her idol in person. She just silently liked and appreciated her. The reason why she became a fan manager was because she recognized Yaoyao’s hard work and tough personality. Through Yaoyao, she could see herself, and she witnessed that hard work would be rewarded. So, she didn’t want Yaoyao to be criticized by others. This was why she became the manager whose task was to coordinate the members.</p>
<p>But, she really never thought about getting close to her idol!</p>
<p>Ye Yun couldn’t calm down.</p>
<p>Chen Lin really deserved to be Shen Yichong’s special assistant. He seemed to have sensed her hesitancy. He took the initiative to send a message with a bunch of company introduction materials.</p>
<p><em>[You can think about it. My boss is on maternity leave recently and is expected to return to work in a month.]</em></p>
