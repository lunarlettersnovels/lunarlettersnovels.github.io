            <p><strong>Chapter 346</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>“I bet Ling Shuang didn’t realize how far this would go. She only wanted to impersonate for a while, but she has been doing it for so many years. From a boy who had nothing, you have turned into a moneymaker by being the best actor. How could she willingly stop benefiting from all that you have?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao grasped the glass of water tightly.</p>
<p>“My sister kept asking me why the elder brother stopped writing to her. Why didn’t she get any response to the letters she wrote?” Yu Xinjie’s eyes could have just about turned red with rage by this point. “After waiting for so many years, she married a man she didn’t love so my mother could blood suck, and my father could pay his debts. But in her heart, she still loved you so much. She was obsessed with you and regarded you as her last redemption… And you hated her. You didn’t even want to speak a word to her, or so much as look at her. She cried to me back then. She said she would rather be dead than stay married, and so decided to get a divorce,” Yu Xinjie squinted, as if she was reminiscing, “Ling Shuang gave me the idea. She asked me to buy Yu Yaoyao sleeping pills…When things were settled, she was going to be with Shen Yichong, as for you… She was going to persuade you to marry me. Then, you know the rest. Yu Yaoyao becomes the hot search for committing suicide, for the love letters she wrote to you, committing suicide for love. It’s just that you didn’t see the signs of her love. You even thought it disgusting!”</p>
<p>The pain in Chen Jiao’s chest was so great, it felt as though his heart was being ripped out. He gritted his teeth tightly, “The love letter said that we first met each other on the day we joined the crew.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it was Ling Shuang who asked me to tell my sister that. Of course, love must be pure. How can she confess her feelings for you by mentioning the past? She only told you that to remind you of the memory, to see if you truly loved her back then,” Yu Xinjie was laughing maniacally now, “My sister is such a naïve person. She will easily buy anything other people say.”</p>
<p>Even Chen Jiao’s breathing was becoming painful. Every time he inhaled, he felt as though he were breathing in knives that were slicing open his lungs.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang again!</p>
<p>“Brother Chen Jiao, you really are so dumb. You only found out about this today! For so many years, you never once doubted Ling Shuang. Yu Yaoyao is also so pitiful! She thought you had forgotten her a long time ago. She cried every day. Even though her husband had plenty of wealth, she was so sad and never smiled.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao pressed his fists tightly against the table.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang… She did look a little similar to Yu Yaoyao, especially the shape of her face and eyes. But now, he only felt disgusted and a little nauseous whenever he thought about that face. The two of them had played with his feelings for such a long time.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao… She was a fool! Why hadn’t she come forward and told the truth!</p>
<p>“But yesterday I asked your sister in person. She said she had never written to me, and she didn’t know me!” Chen Jiao felt like a drowning man who was trying to grab onto a piece of rope.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie chuckled, “Oh, I forgot to tell you. The last time my sister tried to commit suicide, she hurt her brain from the fall and she… Forgot about you. Big brother, she doesn’t remember. You are a whole step too late. But this may be a good thing for her,” with this said, she picked up her bag from the table, turned and left.</p>
<p>But as she walked past him, she leaned down and whispered to his ear. “Best actor, it’s not terrible that you have been thanking the wrong person. What’s terrible… Is that you hurt her, let her down, and tried to use her to leave Guangxin. You even personally put her on the hot search for the scandal five years ago, which destroyed her career… And you regarded the culprit of the whole incident as your treasure. I am already ruined. It is your turn now,” Yu Xinjie sneered. With a numb expression, she strutted out of the store in her high heels.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao didn’t move for a long time. His whole body was cold. He couldn’t even move a finger or make a sound.</p>
<p>His phone screen lit up. Ling Shuang’s name stared at him, reflected in his cold, hateful peach eyes.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had been relaxing after her shooting at the crew’s hotel. Her sides were cramping from the way she had been laugh in the room. She was clutching her calf, and she couldn’t speak because of the pain from her mirth. Tears streaked down her cheeks as she tried to speak, “This can’t work, darling…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was sitting on the edge of the bed squeezing her feet, “Serves you right for laughing so much!” although his voice was cold and stern, his movements were unusually gentle.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s entire face was scrunched up as she laughed, “Who asked you to write praise that was so funny?”</p>
<p>Little Bun next to her bounced nervously up and down. While helping Yu Yaoyao to file her toes, he had picked up a piece of paper on the bed. It was full of handwriting. He read out each word with his eyebrows frowned, “Wife Yaoyao, you are like a shooting star that passed through my dark world and flew into my heart… You are as sweet as um, um… You are about to make me um, um…” Little Bun had made rapid progress in literacy recently, but there were still many characters he couldn’t recognize. He would improvise if he encountered any word that he couldn’t read, which consisted of replacing them with ‘um’.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao listened to her son’s childish mumbling of his father’s praise, especially when he read the censored content, she started laughing again. She was now beating the bed with her fists. “Oh God, darling, baby, you guys are cracking me up! Gosh, my stomach hurts!’</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, his expression unreadable.</p>
