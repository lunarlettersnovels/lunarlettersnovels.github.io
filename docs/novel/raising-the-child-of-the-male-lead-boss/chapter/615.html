            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 137 – Queen of Advertisement (3)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao enthuses, “My eating speed could be varied, I could also eat it in another way… or I can always praise the food in several ways… I can also eat with a smile, or with tears streaming down my face—you can decide how long I should cry…</p>
<p>“I still have a lot of performance to show! How can the first take suffice!?”</p>
<p>Guo Mingxu was utterly speechless.</p>
<p>Since entering a university at the age of eighteen, he had been taking photos in the studio, working as a small assistant to an advertising director. Twenty years have passed ever since he shot his first commercial.</p>
<p>Not only was it something he had seen before—and there were also no actors who wanted their take to be NG or have a retake! Beyond that, she even went as far as to protest for a second performance…</p>
<p>Guo Mingxu slightly moved, but after looking at her acting in the screen a second time, he felt her acting was already impeccable. With his professional eyes, he was nitpicky with even the smallest details. But this… this was more than enough!</p>
<p>“This…”</p>
<p>His hesitancy prompted a former bystander to grab his wife away. Shen Yichong grabs the women before him by her slim waist with a firm arm, as if he was catching an escaping chicken!</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” he says to the director. His impassive mask was still in place, but his crooked mouth gave how he was astonished as he was.</p>
<p>He turns to Yu Yaoyao, his words like a bomb to her ears. “You have already gone beyond the amount of pudding for this week. If you eat again, you won’t be able to touch pudding for the rest of the month.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt a storm rack her body. “… Ah?”</p>
<p><em>What a sinister human being! How can you be so unreasonable!?</em></p>
<p>The latter’s lips press to a thin line, repressing the emerging smile. “Enough is enough. We’ll still have lunch later.”</p>
<p>At her dictator, Yu Yaoyao could only obey. “Okay, fine… oh, we’re having lunch?”</p>
<p>She was quite dejected in the first half of her sentence, but when she realized the word ‘lunch’ uttered by her husband, she felt invigorated.</p>
<p>“What are we having for lunch? You shouldn’t just pile rice on my plate—I want heaps of chicken too…”</p>
<p>She also steals a glance towards Guo Mingx, hoping for a lunchbox from the crew. But before she could say a word, Shen Yichong, whose temples were aching, quickly dragged her away.</p>
<p>“Thank you, everyone, for your hard work. Li Tao, I’ll see you another time. We’ll take our leave now.”</p>
<p>Guo Mingxu: “Ah, yes, goodbye…”</p>
<p>Li Tao: “…”</p>
<p>For two minutes after they left, the whole studio was eerily quiet. Three minutes later, the marketing manager suddenly leaped to his feet!</p>
<p>“Quickly, get the clip out to the internet as soon as possible! Spread it to all marketing channels online!”</p>
<p>Li Tao finally wakes from his stupor. His sister-in-law has just earned him a golden ticket; his pudding is going to hit a new high in sales after ten years!</p>
<p>“And,” he coughs, “Xu, send me a box… the banana-flavored one to my house tonight… maybe add some milk,” Li Tao says, swallowing his saliva.</p>
<p>That night, Yu Yaoyao’s pudding advertisement was published on all video broadcasting websites and took the first place hot search on Weibo!</p>
<p><strong>#Have you eaten a treasure pudding</strong></p>
<p>Traffic is usually the highest at night, with many office workers and students coming home to rest. As soon as the advertisement made its rounds on social media, it was naturally spread like wildfire among their groups of friends through WeChat.</p>
<p><strong>[As expected of my family YY, a treasure pudding tastes better than potato chips!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I’ve been tricked into repurchasing snacks.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Oh my god, this pudding looks really delicious~ this video is making me shake! It’s as smooth and tender as the goddess’s skin. What does she even eat?!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I placed an order!</strong> <strong>I watched this advertisement almost thirty times! Bet my family YY likes banana best. Those eyes… omo! I’m going to eat tonight, and no one will stop me!]</strong></p>
<p>The pudding advertisement swept the netizens into a frenzy overnight. That same evening, the marketing president of Lay’s was reprimanded by their CEO.</p>
<p>“Why weren’t we the first to ask her for a second advertisement? Why didn’t you include a non-compete clause in the contract? Isn’t pudding still a competitor? Are you out of your mind!? We clearly had her advertise for as first, but now we are being trampled by others!</p>
<p>“She didn’t sign the agreement? Then increase the amount, give her more benefits—anything! And contact her quickly! Immediately!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the next day, Yu Yaoyao went back to her hotel to take a short nap before her taping for ‘In the Limelight. Her shoot would likely stretch for three hours max when she received new news from Ni Yi on her way.</p>
<p>“Elder sister, you may have to eat potato chips at night…”</p>
<p>After his explanation, Yu Yaoyao got ahold of the situation and released a peal of giddy laughter.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this too easy?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unsuspecting Shen Yichong was back in the hotel, having just bathed the little bun. As soon as he came out of the bathroom, he saw a clip of Yu Yaoyao eating potato chips inside the nanny van.</p>
<p><strong>[Yu Yaoyao V: Women are born with two stomachs: one for eating and the other to be fed by men.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[But note—delicious snacks won’t occupy your stomach for months!]</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>His scalp tingled; he suddenly felt as if he had gone bald. Sure enough, like quickfire, she went on a hot search.</p>
<p><em>He never needs to spend money on her. </em>A few more names were added to his list: <em>the madam’s man slave, the husband who feeds his wife, and the smitten CEO…</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong was speechless.</p>
<p>But that night, their hotel room was ringed by ‘In the Limelight’ director Zhao Yu, accompanied by Liu Zhengqiang, the online chief executive director.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, may we ask you of a bold favor?”</p>
