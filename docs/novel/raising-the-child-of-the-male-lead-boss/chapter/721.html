            <p><strong>Chapter 30 – Who’s Afraid?</strong></p>
<p>Li Bo originally thought that before the snake would reach her, the spoiled madam would already cry out and open the quilt, therefore throwing the snake out of bed. In this way, not only was he able to give her a  lesson, but it also won’t affect the scene.</p>
<p>After all, this snake scene actually requires only a few close-ups.</p>
<p>Originally, after her mood changes, she can be separated from the snake immediately, finally ending the take.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao was still so silent. Even if she was about to be bitten by a snake, she still remained motionless. He really didn’t expect it!</p>
<p>At this moment, her hand trembled, and the snake seemed to be alarmed. It suddenly straightened its head, opening its mouth to clamp down with a hard bite!</p>
<p>Li Bo couldn’t stand it anymore and stood up! “Stop! Pro—”</p>
<p>The props team have long been waiting for the director’s command and was ready to go to retrieve the snakes.</p>
<p>But who would have thought that Li Bo would stop mid-sentence?</p>
<p>After seeing the picture in front of the camera, he looked shocked and fell back to the chair.</p>
<p>He saw that after he shouted the first word, Yu Yaoyao frowned and slowly opened her eyes. At that moment, there was a hint of a disoriented look in her eyes as if she had just woken up from a dream.</p>
<p><em>She’s still going to act?</em></p>
<p>Li Bo looked at the lens and found that the snake did not move erratically and was only staring at her face with its opened mouth.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao seemed to be confused for a while, not able to process what was happening before her, but when she blinked only was she able to become clear-headed, looking at a pair of cold eyes! Suddenly, her pupils dilated and her once rosy complexion turned pale!</p>
<p>She whispered, “Somebody…” before it escalated to a shout, “..help!”</p>
<p>At the last word, the snake actually lunged forward and bit into her hand!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s words were suddenly caught in her throat and there was an unprecedented fear in her beautiful eyes. Her hands were stiff and trembling. It didn’t take long when the pupils of her eyes gradually became a little disturbed…</p>
<p>Finally, her apricot lips slightly opened to a chocked scream. Her pale face tilted to the side of the bed as she fainted from terror, not uttering a sound!</p>
<p>The onlookers were horrified.</p>
<p>“Oh my God!”</p>
<p>“Is she dead? Call an ambulance!”</p>
<p>“Props leader, kill the snake!”</p>
<p>“Sh*t! It bit! Was it a poisonous snake?”</p>
<p>“When you defang a snake does the venom still remain?! Where’s the medical staff?! Hurry up!”</p>
<p>When they saw Yu Yaoyao’s small, rosy face immediately lose color, in no time the set was thrown into panic.</p>
<p>Even Director Li Bo’s hands were shaking.</p>
<p>Ni Yi almost cried out and rushed over. “Sister, sister, are you okay? Don’t scare me! What do I tell the boss?”</p>
<p>When Director Li heard this remark, his face looked even paler. “These snakes should not be poisonous! Props group, have you confirmed this clearly?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s face was now white as sheet and the sweat on her forehead did not look like it was from acting anymore.</p>
<p>But the next second the snakes were taken, and the paramedics rushed up to stop the bleeding on her hand, they froze.</p>
<p>“There’s no bite.” One announced as he looked at Yu Yaoyao’s hand which were devoid of teeth marks.</p>
<p>The people around became dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“I saw the snake bite down!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean it didn’t bite?”</p>
<p>Li Bo was a little scared, and Yu Yaoyao still hasn’t opened her eyes. He went up and looked at it himself. “Passed out from fear then?”</p>
<p>As soon as he opened his mouth, Yu Yaoyao slowly opened her eyelids, but her eyes were clear. She obviously did not faint from dread.</p>
<p>She frowned and blinked her eyes doubtfully at Director Li.</p>
<p>“Director, isn’t it over? Why don’t you click the clapperboard?”</p>
<p>Director Li and everyone else: “…”</p>
<p>“Sister, are you really okay?” Ni Yi was scared to death.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gave him a strange look. “What did I do? Am I not following what the director ordered?”</p>
<p>Director Li’s eyebrows shook. He quickly ran to the monitor and played back the previous shot.</p>
<p>Sure enough, she did follow everything that was asked!</p>
<p>First, she was awakened by snakes and after her drowsiness disappeared did her face appear horrified. She called for help and was bitten by the snake and instantly fainted. She fell to the bed properly. She actually performed very well, and he couldn’t pick out any problem from the take!</p>
<p>Not only the subtle expressions were worth 5 stars, but the whole process of her delicate face morphing to a pale complexion was natural and smooth, without any irregularity in acting. Even her seemingly simple line was grasped precisely, the words she uttered were completely expressed in the character’s fear and despair…</p>
<p>This skill seems to be even better than the lead actress, Meng Xinran.</p>
