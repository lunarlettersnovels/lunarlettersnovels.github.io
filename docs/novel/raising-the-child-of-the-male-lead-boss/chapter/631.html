            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 121 – Not Yet…</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was like a wet chicken, was carried out of the water by Shen Yichong. Even when she was already out of the lake, she was still dripping all over.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took the big towel held by Ni Yi and quickly wrapped it around her shivering frame.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s upper and lower teeth kept chattering, but with strong willpower, she pulled out a faint beautiful smile. “Hu-hu-husband…I, I, I knew that you liked me… yes, yes, I move you,” She muttered.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes turned cold especially when he remembered she was acting prior with another man before.</p>
<p><em>This is what she specifically told him? </em>His lips that were loose instantly were pressed harder. What does it mean that she knows that he likes her? She really has too much of a bloated ego.</p>
<p>He lowered his eyes without saying a word and gave her hand warmers and a hot water bag with a straight face. Then, he held her like a princess in his arms and strode quickly to the rest room. Ni Yi hurriedly ran in front, leading the way while holding two cups of ginger tea.</p>
<p>After they left, the cast members at the scene began to gossip.</p>
<p>“Both husband and wife are really in love. Without even thinking twice, boss Shen just jumped into the water.”</p>
<p>“So, did she just expose their love story on the show? Boss Shen used to be a man who didn’t express himself and was always taciturn.”</p>
<p>“Tut! no wonder she is so devoted in her performance. Every expression is natural and incomparable. After all, her art comes from life!”</p>
<p>“Did you see it too? After hearing his wife’s words, Boss Shen’s ears turned red.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was the subject of their gossip and held a trembling woman in her arms, finally reached the door to the restroom where she could change clothes. But then, he kicked the door open roughly.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was so frightened that he froze beside the couple and did not dare to move.</p>
<p>And Shen Yichong, with his eyebrows furrowed, placed the quivering, speechless Yu Yaoyao on the sofa and stretched out his hand to quickly strip her off the still wet blue gown.</p>
<p>His large hand lightly touched belt on her waist and loosened the knot neatly. And then his hand moved up and soon stopped at her full chests…</p>
<p>His eyes turned darker, but he still sped up the movements of his hand, taking the belt away. The white blouse dropped to her shoulders, revealing the skin underneath. And the droplets from her hair trickled down to her delicate collarbones and rolled lower, disappearing into her mounds…</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes turned even darker, his fingers moving faster.</p>
<p>But at the next moment, “Atchoo!” His handsome face was suddenly greeted with a loud sneeze!</p>
<p>The dark light in his eyes disappeared immediately. His thin lips pursed into a sharp, straight line crossly. With a dark face, he roughly took off the costume that heavily clung to her skin… Even when her pink peaks hardened under the cold, he still tore it off her with a vicious hand.</p>
<p>With a cry, Yu Yaoyao stretched out her fine jade hand, which was as thin against his thick arms, and covered it frantically.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this old spirit was still somewhat shy when it came to such a moment. Shouldn’t they do this kind of thing under beautiful circumstances?</p>
<p>She currently couldn’t speak clearly, and her makeup was mostly drenched. She was shivering from the cold and her blood isn’t recirculating properly.</p>
<p>She must be so ugly!</p>
<p>“No, no… no! Not now…” Yu Yaoyao’s teeth rattled, but she resolutely refused and pushed away the man who was warm like sunshine!</p>
<p>“I want to be b-b-b-beautiful…” Her little face was full of firmness, regret and unwillingness.</p>
<p>To be able to do it the first time in her life, how can she let it be carried out under such circumstances?!</p>
<p><em>Absolutely not!</em></p>
<p>When Shen Yichong listened to her words, he could only feel his warm blood rise at the back of his head. She blew his mind away.</p>
<p>“What are you even thinking?!”</p>
<p><em>Even when she’s already freezing to death, she can still something nasty!</em></p>
<p>“Don’t you have normal thoughts in your mind?!” He couldn’t help scolding.</p>
<p>However, when he looked up at Yu Yaoyao, it was a different matter altogether. His chest suddenly felt stuffy and his breathing came out in warm puffs.</p>
<p>Although her face was full of resistance, there was a hint of reluctance. Coupled with her slim fingers that were torn between moving it away or not. She is still trying to seduce him!</p>
<p>He is a normal man. If it were another person, her watery eyes full of emotions, would have already drowned the other party.</p>
<p><em>It is indeed a goblin! </em>But there was no need to fool around constantly!</p>
