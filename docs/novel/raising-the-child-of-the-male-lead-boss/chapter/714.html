            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 37 – The Film Emperor</strong></p>
<p>Wei Ming was stuck in place, but at this critical moment his years of acting experience made him move subconsciously. Shortly, his eyes drooped, masking the abnormal expression within, and he reached out to push away her delicate body.</p>
<p>“Perfect! It’s over!” Director Li punched the air excitedly. “Okay, break time!”</p>
<p>As soon as the steamed bun from outside the camera heard that the scene was done filming, he furiously tried to kick his father using his short legs and asked him to take his hands off him. Of course, his kick was caught by his father just in time.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong’s gaze turned solemn, unable to notice his son’s protest. Instead, he looked coldly at Yu Yaoyao, who was still sitting on the bed. It seemed like she still hasn’t recovered, and she was looking regretfully at Wei Ming, who had gotten up.</p>
<p>She had a similar expression from last time when he mistook her taking the sleeping pills. The same heartbroken expression on Yu Yaoyao, who said that she could not do without him.</p>
<p><em>This woman!</em> He couldn’t believe she practiced her acting with him at home!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face was incomparably dark, and he currently stood like a massive air conditioner. An air-conditioning unit that seemed to blow out puffs of cold air for no fee!</p>
<p>The steamed bun was also very unhappy!</p>
<p>Mom is resting! Why is dad still covering his eyes?!</p>
<p>He wasn’t even able to see his mom’s show!</p>
<p>The angry steamed bun, for a moment did not realize that his mother did not say the chicken legs they had written on the script.</p>
<p>And Yu Yaoyao wiped out her remaining tears, which was from when the zookeeper was insensible to her pain as her chicken was eaten by the next door snake for a year.</p>
<p>But in the next second, her body froze. She became keenly aware of gaze with the hint of displeasure at the set washing over her!</p>
<p><em>There’s danger! </em></p>
<p>She was about to look at the corner where she felt the strong sense of malice, but there was a sudden uproar among the busy crew.</p>
<p>The crowd immediately obscured her view.</p>
<p>“Brother Chen Jiao!”</p>
<p>“Wow, Brother Chen is here!”</p>
<p>Several high-pitched cries rang out.</p>
<p>When a man in a brown windbreaker with peach blossom eyes** walked slowly into the set, almost everyone could not help but give way for him.</p>
<p><strong>**T/N: Peach blossom eyes</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>He had an electrifying presence. The tall figure, with legs that seemed to stretch all the way down, had his jacket half opened. On his neck was a thick red scarf that highlighted his smiling peach blossom eyes.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t Chen Jiao, the central man in Yu Yaoyao’s gossips? </em></p>
<p>Everyone huddled, and a commotion struck the set, as if a dog blooded entertainment news at eight o’clock was turned on.</p>
<p>The film emperor Chen Jiao’s role in this show was the lead actress’ childhood sweetheart before she entered the harem. This was a minor role in the show, which didn’t corelate to his status being a film emperor at all…is it the reason Yu Yaoyao picked this project up?</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes became hot and gossipy.</p>
<p>But Chen Jiao wasn’t able to notice the strange gazes around him. He smiled and said his greeting to Li Bo, “Director Li, I’m sorry. I just finished the work from the other group. Sorry if I’m a few days late.”</p>
<p>He then looked to the side and exclaimed, “Why, Xinran! Why are your eyes red? Did you cry today?”</p>
<p>He and Xinran were former students of the same drama school under an esteemed acting instructor, and have worked together before.</p>
<p>Director Li has a good understanding of his temperament, who had no scandals in the entertainment industry. “It’s all right. The filming is wrapped up for tonight anyway. By the way, I just filmed an enjoyab—”</p>
<p>In the middle of his speech, Director Li changed the conversation awkwardly, “Ah, yes. Wei Ming did very well. As expected.”</p>
<p>It was only then did he remember that Yu Yaoyao was present in the set…and her rumored relationship with the Chen film emperor.</p>
<p>Today, Meng Xinran, who already had her fair share of scolding from the director, listened to the director speak. She knew that his cut speech was about to praise Yu Yaoyao for her acting, and her face instantly turned ghastly.</p>
<p>With her head down, she bit her bottom lip tightly, “Brother Chen, it’s nothing. I just saw Sister Yu acting with Brother Wei recently, and found her crying after the scene was taken. Her sad eyes were full of unrequited love. I was only moved by her feelings.”</p>
<p>By just a remark, she immediately raised another uproar on the set!</p>
<p>Just after they finished shooting, Yu Yaoyao burst into tears? Isn’t that when Chen Jiao came in?!</p>
<p>What fiery gossip!</p>
