            <p><strong>Chapter 251 – Vacation (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui reached home, she asked Ni Yi to enquire about the possibility of a ticket change, and how much it would cost. Little Bun scrolled on his tablet for an earlier flight schedule. Thankfully, there was a flight an hour earlier to City B. If they could leave an hour early, they could spend extra time on the beach.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao glanced at the four-figure fee, raised a delicate eyebrow, and patted Ni Yi on the back. “Lil’ Yiyi, please help me change to the previous flight and buy an extra ticket for Little Bun.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was stunned. The Director had specifically explained the reason on why the wives’ flights were always an hour late. If an earlier flight was booked, she would end up taking the same flight as her husband!</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, it’s too late to change the flight,” said Ni Yi, “Besides, you still haven’t packed your luggage.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao clapped her hands, “I’ll be fine!” Little Bun nodded approval, “I will be fine too!” They pointed at two bags behind them.</p>
<p><em>How are they done packing so fast?</em> Ni Yi wondered.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you have everything?” he asked, “There will be a lot of mosquitoes there, so it’ll be best to bring some anti-insect spray. Also, the sun is very strong….” Ni Yi was trying to change the subject.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao waved her hand. “My husband might have already been informed prior to the trip. Chen Lin, as his assistant, should have prepared some. We’ll just take it from them.” Ni Yi looked at her, speechless, unable to decide how he should diffuse the situation. “If I forget anything, you can ask Lil’ Shuang to mail it to me.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi tried his hardest to steer her away from changing to an earlier ticket. “There might not be any tickets left by now….”</p>
<p>Little Bun leaned over and looked. “The flight company allows for booking tickets up to two hours prior departure time.” He paused, scrolling on his tablet.</p>
<p><em>Damn that kid,</em> thought Ni Yi. He felt threatened by the murderous look in Yu Yaoyao’s eyes after his lie was exposed. He had no choice but to call the airline company and appeal for a change of flight schedule. And his luck was so rotten that there were spare tickets. It made him look like an idiot. Ni Yi changed the timing and bought an extra ticket for Shen Rui.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Director Zhao was angry in the car and didn’t want to talk anymore. Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. He looked at the cameraman who was filming him and said, “They are eager to come find me sooner than the allocated time.” Zhao Yu squinted at Mr. Shen. He felt sorry for this man. Was he trying to convince the viewers or himself?</p>
<p>Weibo had also reached the highest level of viewership, especially since Yu Yaoyao was already trending on it. Millions of viewers immediately clicked the link for the live episode of ‘My Wife and I’. Everyone had misgivings in the beginning, but Shen Yichong’s helplessness and the Mother-Son’s <em>modus operandi</em> amused many viewers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui spotted almost similar overalls and similar bags in the airport. Yu Yaoyao’s bag had a picture of a little green snake, while Little Bun’s bag sprouted a little yellow dragon. The mother and son seemed to be in good spirits, posing for selfies together without a care in the world.</p>
<p>A staff member approached them. “Sister Yu, this is your family’s fund for the trip,” she said handing her an envelope, “During this period, all of your food and essentials expenses will be funded from this allowance. You are not allowed to use your own money.”</p>
<p>Another staff added, “As a part of this task, you will have to hand your wallet to us for safekeeping.”</p>
<p>This had been done to increase the difficulty of the participants. Many reality shows operated like this, adding some level of limitations to make the program more exciting. This usually kept the viewers engaged and increased the popularity of the shows.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded cooperatively and opened the envelope. She pretended to not hear the last rule, the wallet one. “Sister Yu,” insisted the staff, “You can’t take your own money. So please kindly give me your wallet for safekeeping. Or let your company’s cameraman hold onto it? I will take full responsibility and return it to you as soon as the task is over….”</p>
<p>The staff trailed off, probably nervous when he saw Yu Yaoyao looking at him coldly. “I have no money on me,” Yu Yaoyao said, “Baby, do you have money on you?” She turned to Shen Rui. Yu Yaoyao emptied her pockets as evidence, Little Bun watched his mother and did the same.</p>
<p>The staff felt helpless. “The money in your bag, bank cards, etc.?” persisted the staff, “If you have any such thing in your bag, please confess. If the crew finds them later in the shooting, they will be taken away.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi bowed his head helplessly and walked over, “Sister Yu, give me your things.” He could sense that they might have hoarded a lot of food like they usually did. In any case, Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui looked at each other helplessly. They placed their bags on a chair beside Ni Yi. The staff opened their bags and took everything out for inspection. The contents were just food, mostly potato chips, pudding, beef jerky, instant noodles, frozen sausages…. Yu Yaoyao immediately put out a hand to shield the food. However, at last the staff pulled out a bunch of banknotes and a bank card.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao tried to get them back, but the staff stopped her. Shen Rui was trying to reach the bank card in one of the staff’s hands. “That’s dad’s…,” he said, his cheeks puffed out and eyes teary.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao put her hands around Little Bun and looked at the staff miserably. “That is my husband’s card. We only have that since he was taken from us. It’s the only thing of his, that is with us. Please give it back!”</p>
<p>“I am sorry ma’am,” said the staff, “We have to take this. You cannot use bank cards. It will be returned to you later.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was outraged. “So cruel, so merciless! Why are you so cruel to an abandoned mother and son?” Yu Yaoyao was just emulating the drama scenes that she had done. She could recite every line. And they usually worked!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was also watching the live video, finally raised his head and smiled. “See? I told you they would start missing me soon.” But his hands had another story to tell. His hands were clasped tightly in anticipation, his knuckles white. The cameraman suppressed a laugh.</p>
<p><em>If you are so sure, then why are you so nervous, Mr. Shen?</em> Director Zhao shook his head.</p>
