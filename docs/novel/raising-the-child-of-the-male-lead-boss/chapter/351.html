            <p><strong>Chapter 412</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Many people were asking ‘My wife and I’ which movies and TV series the video clips had been taken from. They wanted to watch the entire film because the editing looked good.</p>
<p>Wansheng had once again made a terrible decision.</p>
<p>After all their effort and resources, the only thing they’d accomplished was making Yu Yaoyao and Guangxian more popular.</p>
<p>What made Chen Cheng angrier was that within an hour, the producer of ‘Year Itch’ took advantage of the opportunity to release a promotional trailer. This art film had always been low-key. They had never done any publicity. Even though the film was due to be broadcasted in two months, there had been no movement.</p>
<p>No one could have known they’d take advantage of the traffic Yu Yaoyao created to release a trailer.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng almost fainted from anger.</p>
<p>This was supposed to be Wansheng’s publicity, but it had accidentally created momentum for another film.</p>
<p>In the trailer, Cai Fang and Yu Yaoyao’s roles were equally important. The two heroines supported each other through all the despair they faced, all the way to a new life. The drama revolved around the problems the two women faced in the era. Things like, how to balance family and work? How to deal with a marriage that was gradually losing passion? How to get out of a frustrating, widowed family?</p>
<p><em>#Loving Yaoyao’s smoking scene#</em></p>
<p><em>#Let’s go to the cinema together in September!#</em></p>
<p>More and more people were discussing the topic.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng covered his face. He made a phone call to the marketing department. “Abandon the original plan,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>While everyone was enraptured with Yu Yaoyao’s wonderful performances, she was only just waking up.</p>
<p>Before she’d even opened her eyes, she called her husband.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had just left for a moment.</p>
<p>He was in the living room with Wei Ming and Lu Cheng. They were drawing lots to decide who would be the broadcaster for the day, when Shen Yichong suddenly looked up at the bedroom on the second floor.</p>
<p>Lu Cheng was about to let him draw his lot. “Mr. Shen, hurry up. What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Their lot drawing process was also live broadcasted, and the audience could see it. Many fans, who just came over from the war on Weibo, were very happy.</p>
<p><em>[Big dog Mr. Shen must have heard my sister. I bet my guess with an aircraft carrier.]</em></p>
<p><em>[It’s time for our Yaoyao to get up and get fed, the poop cleaner just stood up!]</em></p>
<p>Before everyone’s comments were showed on-screen, Shen Yichong had got up from the sofa; just as expected. “You guys draw first. Just give the last one to me.” Then he went up to the second floor.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s soft voice could be heard coming from the poorly soundproofed, wooden room. While her exact words couldn’t be made out, it could be surmised that she was cute and sleepy.</p>
<p>Wei Ming and Lu Cheng looked at each other and laughed.</p>
<p>Lu Cheng took a peek at his lot, then put it where Shen Yichong had been sitting, without hesitation.</p>
<p>Lu Cheng patted Wei Ming’s shoulder after that. “Brother Wei, Mr. Shen has some really poor luck. He’ll be doing the live broadcast today! I didn’t do anything. You know this.”</p>
<p>Wei Ming blinked and stayed silent.</p>
<p>A cheer overwhelmed the live broadcast room, “Great job, Lu Cheng!”</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to watch the funny videos of Yu Yaoyao’s family after she became pregnant. Moreover, Mr. Shen’s live broadcast was really amazing. The audience got to see many of Guangxin’s artists… As well as Little Bun.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Wei Ming silently agreed. “I’ll go make breakfast,” he said instead, acting like he didn’t know anything.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong brought Yu Yaoyao downstairs, he noticed the well-practiced sad expression on Lu Cheng’s face.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, I’m sorry. Brother Wei and I were chosen for house chores. We’ll have to trouble you with the live broadcast,” Lu Cheng said.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao spoke before Shen Yichong even got the chance to draw a breath. “Lu Cheng, you need to practice that expression a little more.”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng’s face stiffened.</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room burst out laughing.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong didn’t say anything. He just glanced at Wei Ming, who was already busy in the kitchen. Then, he set his eyes on Lu Cheng. “You can go out and buy groceries, I will write you a list,” he said, staring at Lu Cheng suspiciously. “Have you bought groceries before?”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng felt hurt. “Mr. Shen, are you doubting me? I still… Know a little.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded. “Do you know how to judge the freshness of eggs?”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng stared at him.</p>
<p>Seeing that he did not answer, Shen Yichong’s eyebrows tightened. “What about potatoes?”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng remained silent.</p>
<p>Little Bun, who was sitting next to him, raised his head. “Uncle, do you know how to differentiate between Chinese cabbage and cabbage?”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng was completely defeated. Even Shen Rui looked down on him.</p>
<p>“Uncle Lu Cheng, just go water and fertilize the garden,” Little Bun said.</p>
<p>The responsibility of buying groceries was not something just anyone could manage.  In the end, Wei Ming was chosen to complete the task.</p>
<p>After Shen Yichong wrote the list, he also wrote a very detailed note. Other than listing what he wanted and how much of it, the way to choose eggs, vegetables, and chicken was also noted. He even searched the Internet for sample images and sent them to Wei Ming for reference.</p>
<p>Everyone in the live broadcast room was nearly crying with laughter.</p>
