            <p><strong>Chapter 487</strong></p>
<p>Everyone went quiet as soon as the premiere began.</p>
<p>The producer and the director were invited to give a speech. In addition to the fans, many industry experts were also invited to the premiere. Except for Yu Yaoyao, who was absent, the male lead, the supporting male and female leads were all present.</p>
<p>As the female lead, Yu Yaoyao’s video were among the first to appear on the big screen.</p>
<p>At that moment, almost all her fans in the audience gasped.</p>
<p>Just as what she had mentioned on her Weibo today, she had sunburnt-themed makeup, paired it with a peach and pink colored tulle skirt and even had her hair curled and dyed light pink.</p>
<p>She didn’t look like a mother who was currently breastfeeding at all. She totally looked like a Korean star! She looked like she was eighteen years old at most!</p>
<p>“Sorry, everyone, this is a wig,” she began, laughing. “Since I have to feed Little Sweetheart, I can’t dye my hair for the time being~”</p>
<p>She then began her speech. “For this film, Xiao Yi… her world was completely dark, and it didn’t have color until she met Jiang Dahai. Since then, she began to dress herself in a more youthful look. Eventually, that love made her bloom,” she said. “I hope that such dazzling colors can stay in her life forever. So today, I want to be the brightest person and freeze this dazzling, beautiful moment of life for Xiao Yi!”</p>
<p>Lately, Yu Yaoyao rarely dressed herself up when she appeared on variety shows and live broadcasts. She was always wearing pajamas and loose clothes for hom and donned no makeup. However, her bare face was already beautiful. She looked more of the loving wife and mother when she didn’t have makeup on.</p>
<p>The dazzling makeup she put on today completely captured the hearts of the YY fans. The colors of pink and orange made them go crazy, and they couldn’t help but appreciate her beauty! Few of the men present couldn’t even take their eyes off her.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, you will always be the brightest person!”</p>
<p>“She’s shining so bright,” a fan cried. “It has been so long since she last put on makeup for the cameras!”</p>
<p>“I miss this feeling of how my heart erratically beats when I see her!”</p>
<p>“Long time no see, our brightest Yaoyao~”</p>
<p>The fans couldn’t help but respond to her video speech.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s remarks also caused many people present to have preconceived sympathy for the heroine, Xiao Yi, before they even started watching the movie. Originally, many people came just to see the stars. But now, they also started to have expectations for the story.</p>
<p>“Oh no, I feel like I may not have enough tissues.”</p>
<p>When Fang Qiuye heard what Yu Yaoyao said, she started chattering with Ye Yun again. Ye Yun looked at the large pack of tissues on her hands, and saw that it had 100 plys…</p>
<p>“When the tears come along with the snot… I really don’t know if I have enough,” Fang Qiuye continued, worried.</p>
<p>Gong Xuechang sitting in the back row: “…”</p>
<p>It was really just a coincidence that he was also at the premiere, as he got an extra ticket from someone he knew. He originally wanted to give the ticket to Fang Qiuye, but she said that she had to reflect on herself, and she would work harder to memorize English vocabulary and write chapters for her novel. She also said she would lock herself in the room all day today, and she would halt her novel translations for a day.</p>
<p>Thinking that he shouldn’t affect her focus on writing, he used the ticket to watch the premiere. It would be nice if he could take the chance and meet Yu Yaoyao, who Fang Qiuye was so obsessed with. Moreover, he wanted to see what other talents this female star has besides her appearance.</p>
<p>But he didn’t expect Fang Qiuye’s ‘<em>work hard and shut myself inside my room’ </em>turned out to be a trip to the cinema! As Gong Xuechang thought of this, the corners of his mouth pursed. Some students can really make up for any excuse just to skip class.</p>
<p>On the stage, all the actors were speaking and accepting interviews. Gong Xuechang didn’t pay attention to them. Instead, it was fixed on the ‘absentee’ in front of him.</p>
<p>Whenever it came to her idol, she usually becomes absentminded, as if she were focusing all her energy on work and study. However, at the moment, she was constantly chattering with her companion, and seemed to know all kinds of information in the film and television industry.</p>
<p>“The male protagonist is quite handsome. I’ve seen his previous films. Unfortunately, he hasn’t come across a good script…</p>
<p>“…the actor who plays the supporting role always played the bad guy, but he’s playing the good guy this time. But his face doesn’t look very friendly…</p>
<p>“…I heard that Director Liang is so fascinated by Yaoyao that he still wants her to star in his next project! But I’ve watched several of his films. I feel that he has reached a bottleneck in recent years. I don’t know if this one would have any breakthrough…”</p>
<p>There seemed to be no end to the gossip. It almost sounds like she had plenty of time… she was writing full-time, but still must be watching a lot of TV at home. Was this why she always had to stay up late so that she could update her novels on time?</p>
<p>Gong Xuechang’s eyebrows twitched. He felt she was like a student who would only work hard at the very last minute!</p>
<p>“Why do I suddenly feel cold…?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye, who was sitting at the front, suddenly felt a chill climb up her neck and she shrank unconsciously. But just as she was about to turn her head around, the movie started playing; after the series of speeches and interviews ended, the film finally began!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s eyes widened immediately. She decided to ignore the cold wind behind her. She stared at the screen focused, unwilling to miss any scene of Yaoyao. The entire movie theater also fell silent as the film started.</p>
<p>The first shot of the film quickly took everyone’s breath away. Xiao Yi, played by Yu Yaoyao, easily killed a person at the start of the movie. The director did not film a very bloody scene at all.  However, her stare at this moment was sharp, extremely cold, and didn’t care one bit about life. When blood splattered on her face, her expression didn’t even change. As if murder was just experiencing the spring breeze.</p>
<p>She walked out of the room and slowly took out a piece of paper from her pocket, wiped her face with it, then threw it into the trash can in the corridor. She also picked up another ball of paper, thrown by someone on the ground, and threw it in as well.</p>
<p>She took off her gloves and made a phone call. “Mission cleared. Pay up,” she said, and hung up right after.</p>
