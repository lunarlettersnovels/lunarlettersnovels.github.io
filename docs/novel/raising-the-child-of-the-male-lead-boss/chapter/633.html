            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 119 – Heated Thoughts in the Cold</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s steps were docile but still looked charming at the same time. Many could not help but think as if she were a snake that became human.</p>
<p>“Is she doing method acting?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that smart, she doesn’t need to adjust her character.”</p>
<p>“Wrong! Many actresses have tried emulating divine snake goddesses but they all find it challenging. Do you think it’s something she can imitate casually?”</p>
<p>The more classical a role is, the more unforgettable the impression it leaves in the audience’s mind. Many characters can be uninspired, copied with no hint of personal flair to it… and frequently, the imitation is lackluster and becomes only embarrassing to look at.</p>
<p>Many people on the scene thought Yu Yaoyao was trying to do the former but soon found themselves mistaken.</p>
<p>When they saw her walk towards the director to talk about the details for the scene, their hearts couldn’t help but stir. Her beautiful eyes confidently looked forward, her lips plump red and teeth white.</p>
<p>She looked like a fairy that traversed the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>And her walking posture was akin to a thin willow tree’s waist, swaying to the air like a pendulum, like the curves of a water snake! When her hand moved or her foot raised a step, they all thought she was a goblin in plain daylight. And then she looked at the crowd, her eyes twinkling as a gentle and lovely smile graced her face.</p>
<p>The person looking felt suddenly blank for a second. <em>Is she really just acting?</em></p>
<p>At this moment, all the people present were torn on whether her image surpassed that of the original. Because she… seems to be a snake goddess in the flesh…</p>
<p>As she stood in front of their eyes, it was as if she was suddenly a little snake demon who had cultivated into an excellent practitioner and shaped strong like a mountain!</p>
<p><em>There was no need to imitate or surpass anyone; she is like nature itself!</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong stood in the rest area and did not interfere with the scene’s shooting. But when he saw her coming out, for a moment, his heart surged uncontrollably.</p>
<p>From his position as well, the other players present have a clear view. No matter men or women, they were unable to compare with her charming and elegant appearance and temperament.</p>
<p>Almost all the people paled against her at this moment!</p>
<p>She was full of light that his heart couldn’t help but shake. And from the corners of his mouth, a smile curled and a trace of pride that was never there before fluttered in his chest.</p>
<p>Soon, the on-site director let Yu Yaoyao be the first to film. That way, she would be able to take care of her frightened body from last night’s fiasco and finish work early.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong saw her tug on her skirt, ready to launch her self towards the water. She had a dignified look on as she glanced minutely towards Ni Yi.</p>
<p>“Do you have everything?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s body shook, “Yes, boss, I’ve also prepared ginger tea—”</p>
<p>Before his voice could finish, all that he had been holding was taken away by Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “…”</p>
<p>“You look around. Don’t let anyone take a video with their mobile phones.”</p>
<p>As he held a big towel and the ginger tea, Shen Yichong’s image has changed from boss to a personal assistant in just one second. Of course, if it weren’t for the cold expression on his handsome face and the expensive, crisp suit, other people might think otherwise.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was vomiting in his heart. He nodded quickly and strode hastily to the side where the photography team assembled.</p>
<p>In the shooting area, the director was calling for all preparations. And when Yu Yaoyao walked near the makeshift lake, she stood opposite a fierce-looking man dressed in black.</p>
<p>The clapboard sounded in a while.</p>
<p>“And action!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at the paper on the staff’s hand with a frown. He found out that she chose the act where she would be hit, falling into the lake after. She seems to have taken a load of bitter plays recently.</p>
<p><em>Pity, disfiguration…has she become addicted to misery?</em> He thought.</p>
<p>But it seems like she loves crying. Her sad and weak face, coupled with her charm, is enough to affect the hearts of most strong men who have a desire to protect the vulnerable.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squinted his eyes and looked towards the river.</p>
<p>This man dressed in black is well-versed in martial arts play. With a loud and angry reprimand, his arm swept across, hitting Yu Yaoyao’s shoulder with one blow, making her body bend sideways instantly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned tightly.</p>
<p>Her fair skin was especially prone to red marks. In the past, even with a little exertion in their night-time activities, marks he left would take many days to fade.</p>
<p>Such a memory made his lip thin to a tight line. He took an unconscious step forward, the cup in his hand shaking as well and some tea overflowing. When he felt heat scald his fingers, his eyebrows suddenly tightened and his whole person felt as if someone poured cold water on him.</p>
<p>What was he worrying so much for?</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes immediately screwed shut. It must have been all that nagging from his son these days that his actions had become abnormal. He thought about how no one should blemish her skin… instead, the red marks should come from <em>him.</em></p>
<p>All of a sudden, the image of her fair skin covered with the marks he left made his heart tremble.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong finally felt annoyance. His son’s reprimands for feeding her and scolding him about her must be the cause for it. Indeed, such a picture was unfathomable!</p>
