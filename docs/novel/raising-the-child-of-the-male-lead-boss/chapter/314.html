<p><strong>Chapter 449</strong></p>
<p>On the day before, everyone in the live broadcast room could clearly see that Little Bun Shen Rui definitely didn’t like Chen Jiao and he was not even very polite while speaking to him. But today, Little Bun glanced at Chen Jiao frequently with a sympathetic gaze.</p>
<p>When the Little Bun glanced at Chen Jiao even for a second, the tips of Chen Jiao’s ears would turn red, and he would look uncomfortable. If it were not for their age gap, the majority of netizens would have taken it the wrong way.</p>
<p>But soon, Shen Rui clarified what was happening between them. When Shen Yichong went out to buy groceries and Gu Qianqian went to the front yard to pluck vegetables, Little Bun took advantage to whisper to Chen Jiao who was wiping the floor with a rag.</p>
<p>“Uncle Gangster, both daddy and aunty Qianqian are gone. There’s only the two of us now. I’ll teach you how to write a self-reflection essay.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s hand wiping the floor paused for a second.</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room were even more shocked hearing this.</p>
<p><strong>[Did I hear it right? The gangster wants to write a self-reflection essay?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[What did we miss?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Little Bun is transforming the gangster?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Worth observing…Little Bun is about to do something big!]</strong></p>
<p>However, Shen Rui did not do a big thing as everyone thought. He only secretly stuffed the materials needed towards Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s body turned stiffened in an instant, “Little Rui, uncle… I…”</p>
<p>He was no longer a kid. If writing a self-reflection essay could fix the problem, it would be too simple. He quickly shook his head, feeling that he had nothing to say with the five-year-old. “Uncle will continue to wipe the floor. You go and play for a while.”</p>
<p>Little Bun pursed his cheeks, but he did not continue to force him. He just left the paper with him. “Use this when you want to write it, uncle.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao smiled bitterly. He kept the paper, but he did not write. The audience in the live broadcast room were also feeling a little frustrated.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Little Bun was scolded by Shen Yichong because he wiped the mud on the sofa in the living room after playing with the earthworms outdoors. The sofa belonged to the owner of this house. It was neither from their own home, nor did it belong to the program crew.</p>
<p>“Do not cause damage to public property, and do not cause damage to other people’s belongings. Did the kindergarten teacher not teach you this?”</p>
<p>Once Shen Yichong acted cold, his whole body looked scary. Besides the Little Rui, even Gu Qianqian, who was eating fruit next to him, suddenly couldn’t swallow. Little Bun Shen Rui was also a little reckless just now, so he was not being mindful as he played.</p>
<p>However, Shen Yichong also knew that he should never be soft-hearted to his son.</p>
<p>“Apologize to the host,” he said. “If we can’t clean the dirty sofa, what do you plan to do?”</p>
<p>Little Bun lowered his head. His little mouth moved, but he remained silent and chose to accept his punishment in the end.</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian didn’t dare to interrupt the whole process, for fear of making Shen Yichong mad.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, do you need to be so strict? Who hasn’t soiled the furniture at home as a child?”</p>
<p>Out of everyone’s expectation, Chen Jiao actually stood up for Little Bun. Chen Jiao walked over and made eye contact with  Shen Yichong without fear.</p>
<p>“It’s normal to play with earthworms. I even used to stuff them in girls’ pencil boxes.” He even exposed what he did as a child. “Mr. Shen, haven’t you played when you were a kid? Have you always been neat and clean since you were a kid?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao took a step forward and stood in front of Little Bun Shen Rui. He helped block Little Bun from Shen Yichong’s fierce gaze.</p>
<p>Everyone in the live broadcast room was a little dumbfounded.</p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Gangster’s attitude had suddenly changed?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[He suddenly became a good man!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Even Chen Jiao couldn’t resist Little Bun’s charm]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I would definitely help Little Bun too if I were at the scene!]</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yi Chong narrowed his eyes, “I’m educating my son.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao also narrowed his eyes, “Mr. Shen, I don’t think a cold and expressionless education is suitable for children. Sometimes, little kids have sense. You can just remind him lightly.”</p>
<p>The Little Bun gently pulled Chen Jiao’s clothes, but Chen Jiao held his hand.</p>
<p>“It’s wrong to scold a child blindly. Mr. Shen, your way of education is wrong!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyes looked sharp.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s thin lips tightened. He looked down at his son. Then, he looked at Chen Jiao. “Okay.” He left without frowning. “Then you are responsible for solving the aftermath for him.”</p>
<p>As soon as Shen Yichong left, Chen Jiao’s chest suddenly rose and fell, as if he had just breathed a sigh of relief. “Little Rui, it’s all right now.”</p>
<p>But Little Bun looked up at Chen Jiao with a worried look, “Uncle Gangster, my daddy is sulking if he doesn’t speak, and he would need someone to coax him.”</p>
<p>The corners of Chen Jiao’s mouth twitched. He turned his head and glanced at the dirty cover of the sofa. “Let’s have the covers removed and washed.”</p>
<p>Coax my ass! Was Mr. Shen also a kid?</p>
