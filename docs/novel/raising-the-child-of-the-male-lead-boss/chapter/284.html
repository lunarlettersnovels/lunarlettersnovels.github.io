            <p><strong>Chapter 479</strong></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was already blushing. She felt that there was a boiling kettle burning in her mind, and the lid of the kettle kept flapping!</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Big Head? Why is your face so red?” Yu Yaoyao looked up and saw Fang Qiuye’s face. She stretched out her hand and touched her forehead. “Do you have a fever? Are you unwell?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was speechless. Her idol read her novel and touched her forehead… This was impossible! Was she dreaming!?</p>
<p>“I…May I go to the bathroom?” She finally managed to say something after a long time.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao laughed, “I see, is that why you’re blushing? Right, peeing does seem like an important event in life. Let’s go, I’ll take you there~”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye followed behind her, and at this moment, it seemed like the world was silent.</p>
<p>She was not a gifted author. She never thought about having an instant hit or becoming successful after writing a chapter or so. These things seemed unimportant to her. But she firmly believed that she could still support herself and her parents while doing whatever she liked in happiness. Even after failing over and over again and witnessing the low amount of readers she had, it would not shake her. She kept telling herself that it was okay to keep going. But she didn’t expect she would get Yaoyao’s approval today!</p>
<p>“We’re here, darling.” Yu Yaoyao took her to the door and whispered, “If you need sanitary pads, they’re in the drawer next to it! Just let me know if you need anything else.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye hurriedly walked in and nodded with her face blushing. After she closed the door, she immediately walked to the sink, turned on the faucet and washed her face!</p>
<p><em>‘Come to your senses!’ </em>She needed her right mind back! <em>‘Don’t be too complacent yet,’</em> she thought. She still needed to update her novel after going home today!</p>
<p>But… Fang Qiuye raised her head to see herself in the mirror. She quickly covered her mouth, in case she got too excited and screamed!</p>
<p><em>‘Mommy! Your daughter is a great writer!’ </em>Fang Qiuye thought to herself. Although she was not the best, she still worked diligently to be an author that updates her novel regularly. She also had fans!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye glanced around, suppressing the roaring excitement in her heart. <em>‘Uhhh? Was this Yaoyao’s washroom Ye Yun mentioned?’</em></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye took a closer look, and soon discovered that the washroom on the first floor was only used to entertain guests and staff. It was not for Yaoyao’s personal use. The hotel-style-like bathroom design was not in line with Yaoyao’s preference at all, especially with the colors used, nor were there any girly accessories.</p>
<p>She could tell that she rarely used this bathroom. Before this, Ye Yun even said she sat on the same toilet seat and used the same toilet paper with Yaoyao…She must have thought too much.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye shook her head. As an author with apt observing skills, this was clearly not the case. Next to this bathroom, there was a door with a sticker of a fat snake cartoon, which might be the bathroom that was really used by Yaoyao and her family.</p>
<p>This is what a rich man’s house looks like… Even the bathroom was bigger than the total area of ​​her house!</p>
<p>In order to force herself to calm down from her joy, Fang Qiuye could only try her best to remember all the architecture she had seen since entering the duplex villa just now. Her eyes flickered. She immediately took out her phone and started typing frantically on the keyboard. She had to note down! These could all be materials for her novels!</p>
<p>At this moment, she wanted to tell her colleagues that their imagination for wealthy families was too exaggerated. <em>‘Look, Yaoyao, who was worth over 100 million, was living such a simple life!’ </em>But if they looked closely, these simple decorations were also custom-made, and it was almost difficult to see the same style of furniture at other places. This was the low-key way to show off your wealth.</p>
<p>This had to be recorded down! While she wouldn’t write it directly in the novel, she could add some artistic flair to it and make it the basis for her future novels!</p>
<p>“Big Head?” Yu Yaoyao knocked on the door outside. “Did you fall into the toilet?”</p>
<p>Obviously, she was very concerned about her new friend that had the same interest as her.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye trembled, “…No, no.”</p>
<p>“Oh, then I’ll wait for you in the living room!”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll be out right away!”</p>
<p>Only then did Fang Qiuye realize that she had been in the toilet for too long. She immediately washed her face and came out right after. As soon as she entered the living room, she saw a subtle smile on Yu Yaoyao’s face. Yu Yaoyao seemed to have misunderstood the situation.</p>
<p>“Come, Big Head. Eat some melon, you can only poop smoothly when you have more fiber in your stomach,” she offered.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye almost stumbled. What would a person do if their idol misunderstood them to be constipated?!</p>
<p>“By the way, Big Head, why are your eyes red?” Yu Yaoyao immediately grabbed her hand and brought her to the sofa. “Do you need eye drops?”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s alright, no need.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was thinking of the past, so she got a little sad. She had worked for two years, but all she did was fight with different departments every day. While she wanted to achieve something, everyone else just wanted to mess around. While she was earning a fairly high salary, she could neither afford to buy a house in a first-tier city, nor can she feel her value. She only looked successful on the surface.</p>
<p>She met with a lot of opposition when she wanted to devote herself into writing books full-time. She even went as far as to question her own sanity for wasting her time on her college degree and still losing out to many of her peers. But in the end, she directly resigned after a dispute with her boss.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, can I ask you a question?” she asked. “Before you met Mr. Shen, did you ever think about what you were going to do? What would you do if you didn’t have the talent to be a star? Would you give up?”</p>
