            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 129 – Solid Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s fans, fueled by fire, moved in succession like angry bees dispatched from a disturbed hive. Their angry comments for Yaoyao and support for the aggrieved party, spiked across the internet:</p>
<p><strong>[Ranran, I will support you forever! Let’s all boycott YYY from today till the end!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Don’t be afraid! We’ve been here all along. If Guangxin won’t let you, then just switch into a better company! Your fans will raise money just to pay for your breach of contract!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Little Ran, your purity is a stark contrast against that Yu Yaoyao’s evilness!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Till death comes I will not leave you; I will always be by your side!]</strong></p>
<p>Such declarations pasted across the screen. Despite all these, Yu Yaoyao continued to be unfazed. As if in her own paradise, she slept and ate, and repeated the same routines for the next two days, living her days delightfully with a little bun feeding her in all his enthusiasm. Likewise, cold medicine made her groggy, and she didn’t have the mind or energy to see how much commotion she was making; they could all waste their time, was what she thought.</p>
<p>While she was pampered by the little bun, engrossed in their mother and son bond, some people came to visit them, such as her coworkers from the old program. Sometime later, the third competition stage for <em>In the Limelight</em> aired despite the flurry in the internet, releasing the trailer for the fourth stage jointly.</p>
<p>The very next day, Meng Xinran’s official microblog received a blow from an unusual whistleblower; it was entitled ‘<em>My wife has been recently good,’</em> a message entailing a lengthy analysis from an unknown ID.</p>
<p>After it being brought into light, the article then made the hot search as fast as it was posted.</p>
<p>Inside the long but concise text, it listed valid reasons insisting how Meng Xinran was white lotus flower in flesh, and how Yu Yaoyao unfairly became the victim.</p>
<p><strong>[1. In the first live broadcast, Meng Xinran notified 13 familiar contestants of the first echelon, who have all arrived in the set an hour earlier, to withdraw choosing the first room, that my wife would be forced to choose between that and the last room.] </strong></p>
<p>With the first statement, a JPG image of a chat record between Meng Xinran and these people was attached.</p>
<p><strong>[2. In the second test where Yu Yaoyao acted the script according to ‘Disfigurement’, Meng Xinran forcibly changed the order of contestants and broke my wife’s mirror which was supposed to be her prop.]</strong></p>
<p>An unedited video of Meng Xinran’s deviousness in the second competition was pinned under the second statement, a far cry from the released cut footage of which showed her in a favorable light.</p>
<p><strong>[3. In the third competition, Meng Xinran schemed to take away the role of a beggar rightfully belonging to my wife. And after seeing my wife perform well, she attempted to change her acting condition—forcibly pairing my wife to a movie star who she was recently under fire with due to cheating allegations.]</strong></p>
<p>A full analysis of the script of the program was reflected visibly on the screen of every reader.</p>
<p><strong>[4. My wife perished on the night she was harassed by a stranger… yet Meng Xinran’s attitude to catch the culprit was questionable. It was totally inconsistent with her wish to have the people around believe in my wife.]</strong></p>
<p>The surveillance video originally not part of the broadcast for <em>In the Limelight</em> lastly could be seen.</p>
<p><strong>[5. The hotel photo smearing my wife’s reputation and name that was sent to big news outlet was sent from Meng Xinran’s IP address!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[6. I hope everyone can think sensibly. It is already clear who is the white lotus and who is the victim at one glance.]</strong></p>
<p>Such well-founded analysis revealing details not known to the netizens instantly trended, breaking past <em>In the Limelight</em> related rumors about Yu Yaoyao. However, this microblog, which was akin to an anonymous user held tints of protectiveness and fondness for Yu Yaoyao that it attracted everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>Especially since ordinary fans don’t casually call their idols as wife and husband in such dire situations. Yet Yu Yaoyao, who was already married and has a child was endearingly called so by this person!</p>
