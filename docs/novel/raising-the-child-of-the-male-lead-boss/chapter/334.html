            <p><strong>Chapter 429</strong></p>
<p>Everyone was amused by Yu Yaoyao’s funny tricks. Even the organizers were amused. They obviously had never seen such an operation. Generally speaking, if the celebrity cannot come to the scene, they’ll usually just send a pre-recorded video so the organizer could play it if they won an award. It was really funny that Yu Yaoyao even had two signed stickers on the autograph wall now.</p>
<p>Other than amusing the audience, it did not bring any changes to the scene. When Chen Jiao entered the red-carpet with the heroine of ‘Allure’, his expression changed for a moment when he saw the red note on the signature wall. However, he quickly suppressed his strange expression under the flashlight of the media. Those charming eyes of his were full of smiles in front of the camera. He still looked handsome and in good condition.</p>
<p>However, the audiences in the live broadcast room had very sharp eyes. The live broadcast was not like the photos, which could be photoshopped later. Today, the organizers did not apply any filter to the live footage at all. The skin condition of the artists can be seen clearly in the live broadcast room.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s fans immediately noticed the abnormality.</p>
<p><em>[What happened to my brother? Is he too tired lately? Have a good rest!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Look at those dark circles! Oh my goodness, is he staying up late to film recently?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Pay attention to your health. The others are secondary!]</em></p>
<p><em>[He seems to have acne too…Cries!]</em></p>
<p>Other passers-by were mostly there to watch the show. Suddenly, there were remarks such as “Chen Jiao has gotten old” and “Leaving Guangxin has made him gradually lose his color” appeared in the comments.</p>
<p>The YY fans had always been relatively silent, except when Yaoyao’s stickers appeared. But seeing Chen Jiao, they stopped holding back and started to type on their keyboard.</p>
<p><em>[Big bro, you have something up at night again? Can’t you just go to sleep? Listen to what Yaoyao said, do some push-ups if you can’t find a girlfriend!]</em></p>
<p><em>[In the past six months, ‘Allure’ has lost money, and he has not picked up any good character. Bro, why on earth did you leave Guangxin? Why did you want to destroy your own future? I don’t understand!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Leaving Guangxin will be your biggest regret.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Back in the day when Yaoyao was scolded because of a scandal with you, you never bothered to clarify it..Tsk tsk, you wanted to create an image of victim for yourself while you were stepping on your lady boss? You’ll get abandoned one day!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Guangxin raised a betrayer!]</em></p>
<p>The YY fans were being very mean to him.</p>
<p>To them, Chen Jiao had been inauthentic for several occasions. He never clarified anything to protect Yu Yaoyao’s reputation; he left Guangxin when it was at its lowest point; He starred and invested in ‘Allure’; Later, he took over the endorsement of the diamond family and suppressed Yu Yaoyao… The YY fans had a terrible impression of him.</p>
<p>In particular, the more they paid attention to Yu Yaoyao, the more they found her loyal to Mr. Shen, which reflected Chen Jiao’s ungratefulness and his integrity, which made them hate him even more.</p>
<p>Smiles were all over Chen Jiao’s face at the moment. He did not see the comments about him in the live broadcast room.</p>
<p>But in fact, he knew very well that he was in a terrible situation now. After ‘Allure’ was released, he lost 20% of fans on his official fan base in just two months, which was a very large number. In the second half of last year, an action film he starred in was also nominated for best actor this time, where he had little hope of winning. Such action movies were generally hard to win an award. He knew it very well.</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, he filmed another spy film, but it won’t be released until the second half of the year. He came this time basically as a participant. Chen Jiao had no pressure on winning any award. It was very rare to win awards continuously in the industry, and there were only a few exceptions.</p>
<p>He had been sleeping extremely badly and his eyelids had been jumping. Losing fans had given him a lot of pressure. He was also extremely worried if he could even break-even for ‘Emergency’.</p>
<p>He used to think that investment was just a matter of money. As long as there was money, sources of information would be flowing in. There were many projects that would continue to come.</p>
<p>Since he followed Shen Yichong for so long, and he shot so many films, he thought he had enough experience in the operation of the industry. He thought he could do it.</p>
<p>However, he had just found out that it wasn’t so simple.</p>
<p>He had to film during the day and watch the company’s overall development strategy at night. He also had to monitor the development of other artists, and even had meals with various producers to build closer relationships.</p>
<p>It turned out that being a boss was…so tedious! It was much harder than he originally thought.</p>
<p>Till today, Chen Jiao still had thoughts on many quiet nights. He wondered if he hadn’t left Guangxin at the beginning, wouldn’t he be happier because he only had to worry on how to perform the scripts?</p>
<p>But now, he had no way to retreat! He could only move on!</p>
