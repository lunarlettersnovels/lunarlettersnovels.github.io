            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 202 – Warm Affection in Years (2)</strong></p>
<p>The little bun was stunned until he realized that his field of vision had become higher and wider.</p>
<p>He was sitting on the shopping cart!</p>
<p>The little guy whipped his head up!</p>
<p>“Just sit for a small while, you are already quite big now.”</p>
<p>When the little guy turned his head towards the source of the voice, he met with his father’s tough face and unquestionable voice.</p>
<p>Little Bun abruptly opened his mouth and grinned. He felt both sweet and bitter in his heart.</p>
<p><em>Long live daddy! I shouldn’t have competed with Dad for Mommy’s undivided attention, I was in the wrong!</em></p>
<p>Shen Rui glanced at his father through his long lashes, his face dripping with guilt. Well, he decided to magnanimously not compete with daddy for mommy today (but just for today!)~</p>
<p>“Thank you, Dad!” The little brat showcased his full shelf of shiny white teeth. He glanced at his mommy, then at his dad, feeling inexplicably satisfied.</p>
<p>The corner of Shen Yichong raised slowly. ”No need for thanks.”</p>
<p>When the brat started trailing behind, he could see the visibly wretched expression on the boy’s face.</p>
<p>“If the shopping mall uncle comes over and says you can’t sit on the cart, you have to get down immediately.”</p>
<p>“Mm! I promise you, Dad!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded in acknowledgement.</p>
<p>In fact, after his son was born, Yu Yaoyao had never pushed the baby stroller.</p>
<p><em>My son’s childhood was destined to be incomplete.</em></p>
<p>Even though he knew this wasn’t what his son dese`1rved, he couldn’t help but compromise his son’s childhood despite his unwillingness and all the frustration it entailed. Thus, he paid attention to his son’s unfulfilled wishes and deliberately shifted away from the cart, letting Yu Yaoyao push the cart.</p>
<p>After navigating through three aisles, Shen Rui couldn’t help but blush.</p>
<p>“Dad, I’m done sitting.” He spoke softly. “You can get me off the cart now.”</p>
<p>As Shen Rui glanced around, he realized there were no other kids his age who still sat on the carts. Moreover, he also felt that since he was quite heavy and his mommy must be having a hard time pushing the cart.</p>
<p>Little Bun reluctantly grasped at the railings of the shopping cart. Nevertheless, he slowly inched his hands toward his father.</p>
<p>“I can walk by myself.”</p>
<p>A warm light flitted across Shen Yichong’s eyes. He didn’t say anything. He did, however, pat his son’s back in comfort and held him close while hauling the child out of the cart.</p>
<p>“Tonight, you can go swimming with Mommy.”</p>
<p>Little Bun’s eyes immediately lit up.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t notice that the father and son shared a brief period of bonding in such a short amount of time. When she heard she could swim and play in the water with the little bun, she nodded happily, but halfway through, she frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t notice the subtle change in her mood. He indicated to the mother-son duo to not stray too far and walked over to the emergency exit to handle an important office call.</p>
<p>As soon as he walked away, Yu Yaoyao sighed at the little bun.</p>
<p>Little Bun was more perceptive than his dad. He asked, “Mommy, are you tired? You’re feeling sore from pushing me around the cart, right?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao patted his head. “Nope. No matter how big Little Bun is, even if you suddenly grew by 10cms, I can still push you. However … Cub, we may not be able to swim during winters in the future.” As she spoke her face started turning a bit distressed.</p>
<p><em>I don’t know whether I can reveal such a heavy matter to the little cub yet.</em></p>
<p>“Why?” The little guy looked blank.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao glanced at little bun’s baby face, gritted her teeth and decided to tell him, no matter how much it pained her to do so. After all, the little cub’s vocabulary was quite rich, he should be able to understand. He often browsed for information on his tab, he would stumble upon the truth by himself sooner or later, what with him being well versed in worldly affairs.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hated to be kept in ignorance by others, so she decided to let little bun know. It was his right to know such things. After all, he was a family member, and it would be better if he got to know such things from his family rather than through others.</p>
<p>“Cub, your father may not have … money anymore.” As Yu Yaoyao thought, her heart ached. <em>Goodbye, big lobster!</em></p>
<p>The little bun exclaimed in shock.</p>
<p>In fact, as of late, as soon as he returned home, he was able to jump into mommy’s arms and was busy listening to her stories and being bathed by her … So he hadn’t searched for her information online in a very long time. This was unlike before when he couldn’t be with mommy and his sole source of intimacy was to search for her videos online.</p>
<p>“Daddy is broke?!” Little Bun had no sense of money.</p>
<p>“Mm.” Yu Yaoyao bobbed her head painfully. “Dad may have run out of all money, where would he get any to let us swim in a heated pool in winter?”</p>
<p>“Wha …”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, we can only swim during summers in the future.” As Yu Yaoyao stated, she peeked at the stairs where Shen Yichong was attending a call. “When we shop today, we have to choose cheap items!” Lowering her voice she added.</p>
<p>Little Bun’s eyes widened suddenly. “Then, Mommy’s pocket money …”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded while making a ‘booing’ gesture. “In the future, Mommy may be the one giving daddy pocket money! Your father is probably not happy with the current circumstances, so Cub, don’t quarrel with your father during this while, all right? If you want to buy toys or something to eat, tell Mommy secretly, capisce?”</p>
<p>Little Bun blinked in disbelief, his jaw dropped. The wish he made on his father’s birthday for Mommy to wear the pants in the family and give daddy pocket money- <em>Has it come true so soon?!</em></p>
<p><em>Wasn’t this too quick?!! </em></p>
<p><em>My wishes are too powerful!! </em></p>
<p><em>I have a crow’s beak!!</em></p>
