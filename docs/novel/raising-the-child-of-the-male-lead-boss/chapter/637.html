            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 115 – Softer</strong></p>
<p>The next day, Yu Yaoyao woke up in the morning to find Shen Rui, the little bun, still lying beside her on the bed.</p>
<p>His round face was plump and fair and cheeks red as apples. The moment he saw his mother wake up, the little bun exclaimed shyly and yet giddily, “Mommy, you’re awake!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt refreshed and full of good sleep from last night. She stretched out her hand with enthusiasm and pulled the little bun beside the bed and across the quilt into her arms. Her hands immediately touched his smooth little face.</p>
<p><em>It’s just like pudding!</em></p>
<p>The little bun’s small ears instantly became red as he shyly lowered his head, but he was unable to restrain the corners of his lip from rising.</p>
<p>“Mommy, are you hungry?”</p>
<p>Just in time when he spoke this, Shen Yichong entered the room carrying a plate filled with a hearty breakfast.</p>
<p>The temperature of his usually icy face today is much higher, and even the usual cold and hard-edged corners have softened a little. And his eyes towards Yu Yaoyao looked more tolerant from before.</p>
<p>However, with just one second, the gentleness in his eyes was broken.</p>
<p>“Now that you are awake, put on your clothes.” Shen Yichong looked at her, frowning.</p>
<p>She was still wearing the pajamas he put on her yesterday. It was a loose short sleeved shirt. She stretched out her hand and held Shen Rui, revealing not only the whole pair of her jade-like arms, but also more than half of her body leaned out of the quilt. As the skirt of her waist moved up, she suddenly revealed a large part of her slender waist.</p>
<p>The little bun buried his head on her shoulder, and the two small hands grabbed her collar, making the curve of her collarbone appear distinct in Shen Yichong’s point.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, this picture made his throat tight, as he remembered the naked woman under the quilt last night.</p>
<p><em>Wear clothes?</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao bowed her heads in surprise when she heard this. She stretched out her hand, grabbed her clothes and looked at them.</p>
<p>While showing the curves of her body, she also looked at Shen Yichong with a face purely of innocence.</p>
<p>“Seems like I had fallen asleep yesterday.” A doubtful expression flitted across her face as if she had experienced amnesia.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. He put aside the plate he brought in and gave her a set of a pink plaid Chanel skirt and shirt straight from the wardrobe with the tag still not yet removed.</p>
<p>“Wear it.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed but did not move to pick up. Instead, she pulled on the shirt she was currently wearing, bowed her head and carefully took a sniff. Her eyes then gleamed brightly.</p>
<p>“Husband, your clothes smell like you… such a manly scent!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s hands holding the Chanel outfit shook.</p>
<p>The little bun, Shen Rui, was also being held in her arms. He too looked up and took a sniff of his father’s clothes and gave his father a sour look.</p>
<p>This morning, he woke up finding himself sleeping in a big bed together with his mother. It was like a dream come true. But… he wasn’t holding his mommy. Instead, the big, white snake plushie was in his arms!</p>
<p>Ho! He suspected that his father did it.</p>
<p>He specifically asked his father if he secretly slept in the big bed yesterday upon waking up. But his dad wouldn’t admit it.</p>
<p>But now, his mom’s clothes which smell like his dad were a giveaway! And this shirt is even a bit familiar; it was the same shirt his father often wears at home!</p>
<p>The little bun immediately felt blue, as if someone had robbed his beloved mother from him.</p>
<p>He doesn’t have many memories with his mother, and now his dad wants to interfere with both of them! The little bun’s mouth flattened to a thin line in displeasure.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao lowered her head, just in time to see the little guy’s mouth go from a smile to a pitiful pout. She couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>“Hmmm, well it seems that I smell my little baby too — the sweet fragrance of milk and a baby~”</p>
<p>The little bun’s small, depressed face, immediately brightened as if the sun.</p>
<p>“Really?” He sniffed hard, just like a little dog.</p>
<p>“Yes, mommy went to bed yesterday holding her baby.”</p>
<p>The little bun was happy to the point his big eyes narrowed to a crescent.</p>
<p>“Mommy, I don’t want to go to kindergarten today. I want to go with daddy too and accompany you.”</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, Yu Yaoyao felt stunned and looked at Shen Yichong in surprise.</p>
<p>“You’re going to accompany me to the program today?”</p>
