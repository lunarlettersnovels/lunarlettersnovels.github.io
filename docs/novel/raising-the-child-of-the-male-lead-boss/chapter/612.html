            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 140 – The Baby Wants a Family Picture (1)</strong></p>
<p>The little bun stood on the ground, his round head not even reaching Shen Yichong’s waist. He pouted at his father like a little nutcracker by his feet.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong reached out, his eyebrows furrowing. “You can’t be on T.V.” He dismissed the idea directly without another thought.</p>
<p>The hair on Shen Rui, the little bun’s head, immediately stood up in a frizzy, as if displaying his agitation. The moment he looked toward his father, his hair trembled, and the pair of onyx eyes accusing his dad for his despicable behavior and injustice.</p>
<p>He looked down at the tablet and his mouth bulged angrily. All these videos would be preserved for a long time. He would be able to view it every day as much as he wanted. It can be kept for many years as a remembrance.</p>
<p>Why can only his father and mommy film together? Why can’t he go? He also wants to be with mommy and let his uncles record every precious day he and his mommy have!</p>
<p>“Dad, you are such a big, bad person!” The little bun’s spirit shook with anger.</p>
<p>“You didn’t even bring me to your photo-shoot before. You’re too much! Dad, this is too treacherous!” He came to this conclusion conscientiously.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt that all his reason and logic would collapse at this moment. His son, who was quite sensible before and has always been a little fellow following after him. That is, until the time Yu Yaoyao suffered a concussion and her unexpected personality change after she was admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>He massaged his temples, feeling it hard to breathe. “Shen Rui, I only took wedding photos with your mother.” He glanced at his son’s small, but immediate, expression of protest, and the corners of his mouth drooped low.</p>
<p>“You slipped inside my study again? Didn’t dad tell you that there are a lot of important materials for work inside and that you should better play somewhere else inside the house?”</p>
<p>Ever since he and Yu Yaoyao started fighting after Shen Rui was born and their relationship as husband and wife rapidly deteriorated, he asked the maid to put away the wedding photos and have them piled in the closet of his study. If his son can’t come inside, he naturally won’t be able to snoop through his things and see the pictures.</p>
<p>The little bun puffed up his cheeks and looked at his father, turning silent.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao came out of the shower, wiping her hair while walking to where an argument was happening between father and son. The two guys, one looming over the other, were standing as if they were ready to engage in battle. She vaguely felt that the atmosphere was somewhat terrible.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw her coming, the little bun pursed his lips and looked at her piteously.</p>
<p>“Mommy…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at his son’s pitiful appearance, his chest becoming stuffy. For the first time, he felt as if he was too strict on him. He stretched out a hand and gently touched his son’s head. His low voice was now warm, his anger had dissipated.</p>
<p>“The next time dad and mom will have a photo-shoot, we will definitely take you…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao instantly exclaimed, “Does my baby want to take a picture together?”</p>
<p>The little bun sniffed and slowly nodded his head.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong sighed and patted his fuzzy head. He turned around and picked up the papers on the table. “Dad will go out and talk with your uncle Chen Lin. Shen Rui, you play with your mom for now. Dad will be back soon.”</p>
<p>But after one footfall, a voice filled with surprise and tenderness rang from behind him.</p>
<p>“Did my baby Rui really make this photo?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s soft voice soon continued, “Ah, how lovely~ Can you send this photo to mommy? Oh, my gosh! My baby is so amazing. How did you do it?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong paused and turned back. He saw the little bun holding the tablet towards Yu Yaoyao. Her petite face displayed her amazement, with her constant narcissism, she has rarely become curious and excited.</p>
<p>“Wow! My baby is even better than me. Can you teach me how to do it?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong wet his lips and unconsciously took a few steps forward, wanting to see what the fuss was. However, as soon as the little bun saw his father approaching, he stretched out his small hand and covered the screen. It turns out he didn’t want to let his dad see!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face was black. <em>Why, this heartless little thing!</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao noticed the animosity between the two males, and immediately smiled and bent down to kiss the little bun on the cheek.</p>
<p>“My baby, Rui, don’t be angry with dad. Dad is wrong, and so, we will correct him. But when it comes to taking pictures, mommy is also wrong. We should have waited for the baby before taking photos together.”</p>
<p>“In this way, we will all take pictures with the baby as punishment, okay? We’ll take selfies tonight!” Yu Yaoyao peppered the little bun with kisses on his cheeks, and he suddenly turned pink from all the attention.</p>
<p>He looked at his father and then at his mother, barely able to conceal his pout as he slowly took off his small hand covering the tablet. He opened a photo and held it towards his stingy father to see.</p>
<p>The moment Shen Yichong looked down, he only felt gloom.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had taken a photo of her 1.1 meter long legs behind his back a few days ago. But this time, besides her flashy leg, there was a picture of Shen Rui in his dragon pajamas photoshopped into the photo. Shen Yichong tried to retrain his furrowing eyebrows as he looked at his son on his image, who was standing on the ground with a face demanding attention.</p>
<p>His son actually learned to crop himself into the picture… he felt funny and sad at the same time, a slight pain fairly present in his chest.</p>
<p>They have never taken a picture with the three of them together. Although this was because of his personal problems with Yu Yaoyao, it was an oversight that he didn’t realize it would have a profound impact on his young son.</p>
<p>But… he looked at the cropped picture of them together, the corners of his mouth unable to stop trembling.</p>
<p>“And this.”</p>
<p>The little bun saw that his dad didn’t respond, and so, he dug out more dozen pictures to show him. They were all edited photos—like fancy jigsaw puzzles of Shen Rui placed into them. Even in the latest one, the little bun had added devil horns to his dad’s head and angel wings to his mommy’s back.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth had turned stiff, his heart throbbing increasingly loud inside his chest.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao exclaimed excitedly, “Oh! This pink wing looks good! My baby is so talented. Mommy wants a beautiful, pink tail—can I have a long one? And also want a pink version of daddy’s horn. It’s so cute and and pretty~”</p>
<p>The little bun cocked his head, contemplating for a moment, and then nodded gravely. He clicked on the editing app and starting browsing through the effect charts. And with his little finger, he drew two sharp points on Yu Yaoyao’s head.</p>
<p>“Oh! It looks good!” Yu Yaoyao’s eyes glistened as she looked at the little bun on the ground. She picked up the little fellow and held him in her arms.</p>
<p>“It’s actually possible to make pictures like this?”</p>
<p>She was soon lost in confusion by the various features in the editing software. Before long, she was lying on the bed with the little bun in her arms. The mother and son, laying with their heads close and face almost touching, began to take selfies from various angles trying on different poses.</p>
