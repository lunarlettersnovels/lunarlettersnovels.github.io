            <p><strong>Chapter 402</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>All it took was this one comment to get the people to start brainstorming ideas for possible activities. Some suggested he could dance, sing, and some asked him to bring their Yaoyao over to perform a flying kiss…</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>Little Bun replied on his behalf, “Mommy is sleeping and can’t get up to perform a flying kiss. If you want, you can do it with me. Daddy has a beard so it would hurt! My daddy can’t sing or dance. He only knows how to make money.”</p>
<p>His voice was transmitted through the radio microphone prepared by the program group. Everyone in the live broadcast room heard him clearly and burst out laughing.</p>
<p><em>[Was that baby Ruirui?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Wow! It really is a new variety show! Mr. Shen, turn the camera! I want to see Baby Ruirui!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Little Bun: My father is so stupid; he can’t do anything except make money (helpless);</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen: I also know how to beat my child. Believe me!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen, let your son do it. Your expressionless face is not suitable for a live broadcast!]</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed his temples and stared down at his talkative son next to him.</p>
<p>Little Bun quickly covered his mouth and butt.</p>
<p>Neither the director nor the staff could resist and just laughed silently.</p>
<p>Under the intense gaze of his father, Little Bun added more to his previous statement. In a soft voice he said, “My dad also knows how to write an essay of praise, and… A self-reflection essay. Daddy, I think more people would watch the broadcast if you showed them how you wrote a self-reflection essay,” he suggested worriedly.</p>
<p>Little Bun kept a careful watch on the fluctuating number of people in the room. His daddy still had a long way to go.</p>
<p>The fans were all shocked!</p>
<p>Many of them had watched ‘My Wife and I’, but they had never seen the section where Mr. Shen had written an essay of praise or a self-reflection essay… This was enough to make their imaginations run wild.</p>
<p>Many people started typing wildly in the comments.</p>
<p>If Mr. Shen live broadcast his essay writing process, they would call their brothers, sisters, colleagues and classmates to watch. They would even give rewards.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed his hands together. He frowned as he watched the comments on the screen. If this had been requested before the show, he wouldn’t have cared, but he needed the money now.</p>
<p>10% of the rewards would be used as household funds. That way, he could buy meat and vegetables. His wife had said she wanted steak for dinner.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong gritted his teeth and looked at his son. “Shen Rui, come and sit next to Daddy. You can write an essay for your mother. You have never written one before.” He betrayed his son to his wife. “Your mother would be so happy if she woke up to your letter.”</p>
<p>As soon as Little Bun heard this, his eyes lit up. He was so excited he forgot he was busy roasting his father.</p>
<p>He whizzed off the sofa. “Okay, Daddy. You don’t move, I’ll write an essay!”</p>
<p>His mommy loved him more!</p>
<p>He went to his schoolbag and pulled out all the paper he had, then quickly ran back to the living room as fast as his little legs could carry him.</p>
<p>The live broadcast room got very excited when he appeared in front of the cameras again with his cheeks all flushed pink.</p>
<p><em>[God! Is this our baby Rui?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’ve watched the whole season of ‘Wife’, and I nearly died from a cuteness overload now when I saw Little Bun’s face for the first time. I can’t believe I’m finally seeing his face after it’s been blurred out on the show the whole time! Oh my god! He looks even cuter than I thought!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Those little arms, fair legs, bun face…Oh god! My heart!!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Oh my God… Even just him climbing onto the sofa is cute!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Cries… You’re making me want to have a son!]</em></p>
<p>A wave of rewards rushed in before he even started writing.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was rich, but he couldn’t compete with the fans’ love for Little Bun. There were people who offered rewards so Little Bun could buy food, books and clothes.</p>
<p>Little Bun, on the other hand, had a serious expression on his face, as if he were about to do something bold.</p>
<p>The fans became even more excited. They all wished they could lean over his shoulder, through the screen so they could see what he was writing.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was a very reliable parent. He helped his son adjust the angle of the camera so the audience could see his handwriting clearly.</p>
<p>Little Bun’s characters were a little crooked, but he was obviously trying very hard and was writing quite studiously. If he came across a word he didn’t know, he stopped and asked his father for help.</p>
<p>“Daddy, how do I write ‘Mommy is an angel’? Daddy, how do I write that Mommy is charismatic and beautiful?”</p>
<p>Before he had even finished writing, the whole live broadcast room could feel his love for his mother!</p>
<p>The incoming stream of rewards seemed to be never-ending.</p>
<p><em>[Isn’t baby Rui only five years old? He’s so smart!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I always saw him holding a tablet, attending online classes in the previous variety show. As it turns out, he really is a baby genius!]</em></p>
<p><em>[My God… Baby Rui with this IQ and face! I’m dead!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’ll stop talking now and start on my practice questions. I’ve lost to a kid!]</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s brows finally relaxed after seeing the surge in the live broadcast room. But they still had a way to go before they reached their goal.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong thought for a while. Then, he raised his head and put his phone in front of the live broadcast camera. “It’s 1PM now. The stock market is open. While Shen Rui is writing his essay, I will live broadcast my stock trading for everyone to see. Let’s see if we can earn 100 000 Yuan in two hours. If you need my advice, leave me a message.” After he finished speaking, he looked at director Zhao Yu. “Can 10% of the investment income be converted into family expenses? Can the tuition fee I received for teaching online be used as family funds?”</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room were all shocked and amazed!</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was speechless. He thought the show would be less exciting if Yu Yaoyao was asleep.</p>
<p>But he had underestimated Shen Yichong!</p>
