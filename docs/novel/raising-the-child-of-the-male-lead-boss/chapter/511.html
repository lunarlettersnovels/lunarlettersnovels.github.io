            <p><strong>Chapter 252 – How to Cheat (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>The staff that had confiscated the money and the bank card sighed. “And no snacks.”</p>
<p>This was the last straw. Yu Yaoyao was facing a full-fledged crisis now. She hugged Shen Rui miserably, who was wailing because of this recent development. They raised their heads to the camera, eyes horrified.</p>
<p>The comments on the live broadcast platform blew up. The fans of Yu Yaoyao, who had been patient with the live telecast, couldn’t hold back anymore. They found the situation hilarious:</p>
<p><strong>【The words “no snacks” made Miss Y’s beauty shatter in a second. Ha ha ha ha ha!】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【The little boy’s expression cracked. Ha ha ha ha ha! That made me laugh! The shock synchronism on their face was so funny! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Miss Y: Do you want to steal my husband? I’ll play with you guys; Do you want to take my snacks away? I’ll ……bite you to death! 】</strong></p>
<p>While the comment section was blowing up, Yu Yaoyao pitifully embraced her snacks one last time, while hugging Shen Rui. “It can’t be…,” she trembled, “These rations are for my child. They are my only consolation. You can’t take them away!”</p>
<p>The staff who had maintained their composure till the end burst out laughing. “You just said that the bank card was a consolation to you, and now the snacks?” one staff expressed, barely holding his laughter together.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at Shen Yichong’s card on the table, and then at the snacks. “Can I choose one?” she asked unhappily. The staff shook their heads. Yu Yaoyao was outraged. “Then take it!” she yelled, “You take my husband’s card. The money he managed to save and give to me! How heartless!”</p>
<p>She looked back at the snacks and bit her lips. “You must leave the snacks, ma’am,” said the staff.</p>
<p>Shen Rui reached out a hand and tugged at his mommy’s sleeves. Yu Yaoyao touched his head. “Baby, we are going to fly soon. Have you ever been on a plane before?” Little Bun shook his head, looking reluctantly at the bank card they had to leave behind. “It’s alright, sweet,” she assured him, “Even if we did have the card with us, we won’t be able to buy anything in the plane, anyway. The card would have been useless either way.” She was trying to make Shen Rui feel better. Shen Rui looked at his mum and thought that she made sense, so he nodded. She patted her son’s shoulder.</p>
<p>A staff promptly announced that they would be taking away the card and the snacks. Three others rushed in and swept it all away from the table. But Yu Yaoyao was still trying to smuggle the instant noodle and ham sausages. Ni Yi sighed. He approached them and took the snacks away from her hands. “Sister, instant noodles are unhealthy. It’s not good for Shen Rui either. Leave them here. Your food and other expenses are already taken care of.”</p>
<p>The live broadcast was filled with fired-up incoming comments from the fans who were enthusiastically following the footage and couldn’t help but remark on the hilarity of the situation:</p>
<p><strong>【Miss Y: I heard the rules, but… I don’t want to understand! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Deceive me into buying instant noodles again …】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【The guy who follows her with camera seemed to be on the verge of total derangement. 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【I’ve just cut out to take a look at the other two families. The singer, Huang Shan, only had a card and handed it over obediently, and Da Fu’s wife also just dawdled for a minute before handing it over! Only Miss Y is still fighting against the staff! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Did anyone notice that Miss Y just spent ten minutes packing? I just admired how fast she was! And … it’s all food. She didn’t bring any clothes! 】</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was still unaware of the audience’s “roast” and the discussion about her luggage, looked at the staff and Ni Yi with disappointment. Little Bun came forward and tried comforting his mum. “It’s okay, mommy. Let’s get on the plane.”</p>
<p>She seemed to have gained a bit of energy at her son’s words. “Yes, it’s alright, pumpkin. We still have the money that was given to us, anyway!” She took out the envelope and laughed. The fans and viewers began to worry at this abrupt change of her reaction and wished for Shen Yichong to be back soon.</p>
<p>She opened the envelope, and the cameraman went for a close-up. Yu Yaoyao was stunned. She dug her hands in the envelope and extricated five coins. She almost tore the envelope in anger. The staff cleared his throat, “The cost for changing your ticket timing was deducted from that. We are sorry your outlays are limited.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao seemed to be in a rage. “Then change it back to the original timing!”</p>
<p>“That will cost you again,” the staff replied calmly, “Your family will be in negative assets. It could hamper the condition of your stay on the island.”</p>
