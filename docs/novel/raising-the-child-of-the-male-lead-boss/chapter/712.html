            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 39 – Fire Versus Ice</strong></p>
<p>He was dressed in a black trench coat with slim black trousers underneath paired with a crisp, white shirt. On his arms is a mini-version of him—his son with the same face structure and reserved, mature masculinity.</p>
<p>They were like an unstoppable force.</p>
<p><em>Where did these handsome guys come from!? </em>The women on the show were a little distracted.</p>
<p>The tall, brooding man is a sharp contrast to the approachable Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>One is as warm as light, the other as cold as ice. One smiles as if the peach blossoms were in full bloom, and the other was impassive, but his eyebrows and eyes were as unfathomable as the deep sea.</p>
<p>His tall stature, cold but mysterious aura and fine-looking face did not the very least lose to Chen Jiao, who was recognized to have no dead angle in all 365 degrees!</p>
<p>If they both starred in a movie, it would absolutely fascinate a plethora of young girls with their appearance and clashing temperaments!</p>
<p>But just when everyone was still stunned, and even Meng Xinran whose eyes were engrossed on him, Yu Yaoyao gave a surprised cry, and suddenly pulled up the train of her costume.</p>
<p>Like a panicked pigeon, she attractively fell into the arms of this mature man!</p>
<p>“Oh, honey! There you are! I was scared to death!”</p>
<p><em>It was you all along! You almost scared me to death! </em>She thought, oh how <em>nice</em> it was to have the feeling of asphyxiation.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it was the human air conditioner who was peeking around. If she had said the wrong thing, she would have brought herself a ticket to the afterlife!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao buried her head between his chest the steamed bun on his side.</p>
<p>“A snake just tried to bite me! And an elder brother, who is not as handsome as you, scolded me with his eyes!” she snapped, and tears dripped down her face once more.</p>
<p>Wei Ming, who wasn’t a handsome man, almost dropped the cooing baby that his assistant was handing to him.</p>
<p>She’s not talking about him, is she?</p>
<p><em>When did I scold her with my eyes? </em>He could only be in a state of confusion.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao, standing on the other side, was also shocked. <em>Not as handsome as he is, she said.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the crew, however, was beyond shaken with this picturesque display of a family of three hugging!</p>
<p><em>This high-quality man is unexpectedly is Yu Yaoyao’s husband, the Guangxin boss!? </em></p>
<p>Legend has it that he owned countless real estates and financial investment firms abroad, but he never actually revealed his true face in front of media reporters…</p>
<p><em>What the f*ck! What a big catch! Yu Yaoyao’s husband is this super handsome boss?</em></p>
<p>People cannot help but look towards Chen Jiao who was like a walking fireplace.</p>
<p>At this point they truly feel that it is true—a woman with a brain wouldn’t cheat on this man, ah!</p>
<p>Her husband is rich and powerful. His appearance is also first-class, even comparable to the film emperor! Why does she still have to cheat on another man!?</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao resolutely said her husband is better than Chen Jiao, they felt some disbelief at this, but with the facts in front of their faces, they now know!</p>
<p><em>Cheating? No way!</em></p>
<p>Noticing the hungry, gossipy eyes cast by everyone on them, Shen Yichong hurriedly pushed Yu Yaoyao to the side.</p>
<p>He nodded to the director, who was also gossiping with the crew. “Director Li, thank you for your hard work.”</p>
<p>Li Bo showed a complicated look and pulled out an awkward smile. “It should be me thanking you. Boss Shen, actually came to visit the set today?”</p>
<p>He has met Shen Yichong before.</p>
<p>It was the time when Yu Yaoyao was forcefully stuffed into his crew. He resisted with all his might and secretly scolded Shen Yichong like a furious old uncle for acting like a fool. Asking him if he had a broken brain for spending outrageous amounts of money on his stupid wall of a wife.</p>
<p>Now, he met this god again, whom he had scolded several times before; he wants to fart just thinking about it.</p>
<p>After all, Li Bo feels that every shot they had filmed of Yu Yaoyao today was perfect. And in every shot, it slapped him in the face, but not only was he <em>not</em> angry, he was beyond glad to be beaten!</p>
<p>It was actually a sweet surprise for a passionate director like him, and he had wanted her to act another three hundred rounds more!</p>
<p><em>Tsk! I’m so—what a son of b*tch! </em></p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, are you not at ease on your wife’s first day back on filming?” Li Bo thought, his old face flushed as he rubbed his hands. Chen Jiao had been tossed aside.</p>
