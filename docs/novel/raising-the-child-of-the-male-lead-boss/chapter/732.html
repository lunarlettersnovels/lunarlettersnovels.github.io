            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 19 – Husband, Help Me Carry My Bag (3)</strong></p>
<p>Back when she was in the hospital, she knew Yu Xinjie would have already sold the love letters. Therefore, no matter what she did, this scandal was to befall on her; she couldn’t escape it.</p>
<p>But only then when she recalled the contents of the novel, rather, when she saw the little child, did she find a loophole around this particular scene.</p>
<p>She had calculated his age, tracing the memories back to almost five years ago. Then she went through all her past Weibo records, as well as her family files. And sure enough, she found her ultrasound records from that time. It was fortunate that she found out she was pregnant and had kept the photos before she entered the filming location… or else she wouldn’t be able to escape from this death route.</p>
<p>“Mommy, you said that you saw me, but wasn’t I still in your stomach?” With the little bun’s high IQ, he immediately found the key point to the problem.</p>
<p>“What do you think is this?” Yu Yaoyao smiled and went through her mobile photo album for a particular picture. In the photo was a small, fuzzy ball, like a small nebula.</p>
<p>The little bun suddenly felt silly. When he saw the picture for the first time, he felt it was ugly!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pointed to the little ball. “This is a picture taken by the good doctor of the baby who was inside mommy’s stomach that time.”</p>
<p>She searched for her ultrasound photos to make sure she could get through the upcoming storm safely… The original owner was hopelessly in love with the film emperor to the point she would crazily write a diary to express her love. But from the beginning to the end, she didn’t really cheat with him.</p>
<p>At the very least, she had to keep her dazzling, motherly halo in front of Shen Rui. She could not let the child grow under the incorrect thinking that his mother had been an adulteress. In the original plot, he grew up lacking motherly affection he desperately needed, becoming callous. The little child had talked back to his nanny and ran towards the road, finally becoming involved in a car accident.</p>
<p>She could not let his horrific future happen; she must change the little bun’s fate, as well as hers!</p>
<p>On the other hand, while the little bun was looking at the photos, he felt the need to throw away her cell phone!</p>
<p><i>Is that him? That ugly thing? Woah!</i> He could only think, horrified.</p>
<p>He looked like this when he was a kid, no wonder his mommy didn’t want to hug him.</p>
<p><i>Too small, too ugly! </i></p>
<p>“Mommy, you’re right. I’m sorry.” The little bun sobbed, his little hands shaking. In the end, he hugged Yu Yaoyao’s mobile phone and the golden beans that he had endured for a long time slowly fell, drip by drip.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately patted him on the back, soothing him and wiping his tears dry. “Don’t cry!”</p>
<p>“A man will only be punished if he did something wrong. Mommy won’t punish Little Ruirui if he listens properly to Mommy starting today, okay?”</p>
<p>Shen Rui immediately lifted his little head and gave a solemn nod.</p>
<p>“Good! Now let’s go to the amusement park!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao high-fived the little bun and casually glanced at the man with a stoic expression sitting next to him. “Honey, can you close the door now?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squinted his eyes and pulled the door closed with a snap.</p>
<p>“What a good man, my husband.” Yu Yaoyao then hummed twice. “You slandered me for something that was five years ago, you have to make it up to me!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrow and asked Chen Lin for a check. “How much do you want?” He asked, rummaging for his pen.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao winked and went for his searching hands. Once again teasing the palm of his hand, and making his whole body shake in surprise.</p>
<p>“Honey, you’ll be punished by carrying my bag for the whole time today.”</p>
<p><i>That’s what husbands do for their wives in TV dramas! </i></p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>The woman had finally stopped asking him for outrageous sums of money. Why didn’t he still get used to it?</p>
<p>At the gate of the amusement park, the little bun had a beautiful mommy holding his left hand and a majestic father clasping his right hand. With his teeth displayed, he showed a happy smile at Uncle Chen Lin.</p>
<p>“Baby, Mommy wants to ride the rollercoaster. Do you want to play with Mommy?”</p>
<p>The little bun nodded shyly.</p>
<p>And Shen Yichong merely said, “I’ll wait for you down there.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pursed her mouth and with an innocent smile, she extended her bag towards him. “Baby, you call Dad and <i>tell </i>him to go with us. Mommy is very afraid of heights!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
