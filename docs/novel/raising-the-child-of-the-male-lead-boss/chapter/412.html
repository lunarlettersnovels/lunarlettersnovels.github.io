            <p><strong>Chapter 351</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Ling Shuang returned to the nanny van, trembling and unable to say a word. The role she had prepared for, for more than two months, was gone! She had worked hard as a preschool teacher and studied harder for the qualification test. All so she could play her role well. And now… that role was gone!</p>
<p>Like a fool, she had dressed as if she were attending a dinner party. She had put in so much preparation before attending the opening ceremony. And in the end, she didn’t even get the role she had worked for! To make it worse, she had fallen in front of the reporters. She would be beyond embarrassed if those photos got posted online.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang was so angry that she gritted her teeth, and she swore she could feel blood rising in her throat.</p>
<p>The director had even come and pretentiously asked her if she wanted to stay and play the supporting role of the aunty who fell and died in the river. She wouldn’t even have had her face shown. This was the lowest class of group performances. A corpse wouldn’t need to show their faces, or have any lines.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang was furious.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, she manically called Chen Jiao over and over again. Finally, after more than a hundred missed calls, a strangely muffled voice answered the phone.</p>
<p>“Hello? Brother Jiao! What happened? My role has been taken by someone else! Xiao Huang pushed me, and I fell! I only scolded her a little, and she left without me! Brother Jiao, I am now all over the hot search on Weibo!” Ling Shuang’s voice was no longer as soft as it had been before. It was sharp and demanding. By the end of her speech, her eyes were red with tears of rage.</p>
<p>She felt angry, anxious and wronged!</p>
<p>“Don’t be so anxious,” on the other end of the call, Chen Jiao’s hoarse, low, and unnaturally cold voice said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be anxious? Brother Jiao, are you joking? How can I not be anxious? My role is gone! I only found out that Gu Qianqian has taken over my role when I got to the ceremony today! Is someone trying to play tricks on us? Could it be Yu Yaoyao…”</p>
<p>“Ling Shuang!” Chen Jiao’s voice was suddenly loud and angry.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s hand holding the phone trembled. “Brother Jiao, you… Yelled at me?” even her voice was trembling.</p>
<p>In the next second, the other end of the phone became very noisy, as if something had been dropped.</p>
<p>Then, Chen Jiao’s muffled voice returned to normal again. “The crew is noisy. I’m busy right now. You go home. I’ll send someone to investigate. Remember, stay down, and don’t cause trouble. Yu… Yaoyao, don’t mind her. I’ll follow up.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang whimpered, not noticing anything unusual in what he had said. “Brother Jiao, you must seek justice for me. She can’t do this to me. She’s too evil. I only wanted to play a role, and she won’t even let me do that…”</p>
<p>“Enough! How do you know this was her doing?” Chen Jiao hollered.</p>
<p>“The director called me. I’ll ask my manager to meet you. Brother Jiao, who else could it be other than her? And Xiao Huang! I am firing her! I want compensation from her!” Ling Shuang shouted furiously.</p>
<p>She soon realized she was talking to the steady beep of a hung-up call. She slapped the seat angrily, which only ended up hurting her hand.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long until Ling Shuang, still sitting in the nanny car fuming, saw all kinds of comments popping up from netizens who were criticizing her in the hot search:</p>
<p><em>[I saw this coming! Her character is just terrible. She shouldn’t even have thought about playing the role of a teacher; even after she apologized for the last incident!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Would she even have apologized publicly if that incident wasn’t exposed? Serves her right!]</em></p>
<p><em>[The crew didn’t even notify her that they kicked her out? HAHAHA! You can tell just how much the director hates her. But it seems normal if we think about it. A scandal of her appears abusing a child after the filming starts, I’m sure the movie will be banned!]</em></p>
<p>Ling Shuang was so angry that she immediately created a new, unofficial account to argue with the netizens:</p>
<p><em>[She did not abuse any children! She made a public statement last time, and the parents of the children accepted the apology. Can you keyboard heroes get your facts straight and stop talking nonsense!]</em></p>
<p>But the netizens knew when to stand up for their opinions. Many people usually only fought against injustice, but they were now being attacked.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, Ling Shuang’s newly created account was flooded with criticism:</p>
<p><em>[Huh, new account? Are you Ling Shuang herself, or are you her friend? You know the story so well because you were the idiot who made the child cry by stepping on her origami, right? You were exposed when you tried to impersonate a teacher, and this time you are impersonating a righteous person on the internet! I think you were born to be an impersonation addict!]</em></p>
<p>This one comment pierced through Ling Shuang’s fatal weakness. Her face paled at the criticism.</p>
<p>The firepower of the other commenters forced her to retreat; she was unable to defend herself at all.</p>
<p><em>[The mouths of the artists are as deceitful as ghosts!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Ha! How much do you earn by writing this one comment? Add me if there’s a group for this so I can earn money as well!]</em></p>
<p><em>[My ass! Why did the crew suddenly change the person playing the role if she was the one wronged?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Did you forget to recharge your brain?]</em></p>
<p>Ling Shuang caved under the pressure. She abandoned the new account to escape. Soon, on the hot search, she saw news about the opening ceremony of ‘In the Mountain’ on her main account.</p>
<p>The director personally tagged all the lead actors and actresses in the post. Amongst them was Gu Qianqian, who had replaced her.</p>
