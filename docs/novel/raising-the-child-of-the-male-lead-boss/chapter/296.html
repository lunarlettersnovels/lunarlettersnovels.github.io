            <p><strong>Chapter 467</strong></p>
<p>None of them could have imagined that they would now have to use English while ordering take out. Yaoyao was really quirky. While they thought they were fully prepared, they couldn’t help but admit their defeat in just one second!</p>
<p><em>How would you say the dishes’ names in English? </em>The audience who weren’t good at their English almost cried looking at the wooden sign held by Little Bun.</p>
<p>Did they wake up the wrong way this morning? Or did they open the live broadcast wrongly? Who said that Yaoyao could enter the drama school because of her poor academic performance? Who said that she was hesitant to study in difficult courses?</p>
<p>At the time when ‘Youth Without Regrets’ was broadcasted, everyone was busy discussing Yu Yaoyao’s academic performance. Unexpectedly, today, everyone fell into despair once again! For a beautiful and rich wife, an impactful actress, and a very interesting soul… how did she come up with this skit?</p>
<p>President Fang Qiuye was also trembling in front of her screen.</p>
<p>“D*mn it!” she cursed. “Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>She was currently a science and engineering major in college. She also passed the college entrance examination with high marks. Although she couldn’t speak English very well, she had no problem taking the test back then. However, as a science and engineering student, she barely encountered English after her second year of college. Her English reading skills were acceptable, but her verbal skills were terrible.</p>
<p>Knowing that she had no talent for English, Fang Qiuye completely gave up the course as she didn’t need it for her major classes.</p>
<p>After two years of college, she became fascinated with Chinese novels. She started writing for fun and was even signed to be a website author later. Since then, her fate with English has concluded. Then, after another two years of working while coding part-time, she quit her writing job and started coding at home full-time.</p>
<p>So… English? Fang Qiuye’s face was extremely sour. She hadn’t used English for at least four years. A simple greeting was still doable, but making an order…</p>
<p>“Are you ready, baby?!” Yaoyao suddenly exclaimed.</p>
<p>She sounded pretty fluent. She even blurted a series of phone numbers in English, which was the takeaway number that everyone had to dial in today!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye started writing them down as soon as she heard the numbers.</p>
<p>Three…</p>
<p>One…</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye thought to herself that as someone who had received compulsory and university education, memorizing numbers should be easy for her. However, her confidence was clearly too much!</p>
<p>“D*mn it! What’s the number after 6?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye grabbed her hair instantly. She couldn’t remember it although she obviously heard it just now! Her bad memory must have been a result of staying up late to code two nights before!</p>
<p>“Xiao Yunyun, please help me!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye hurriedly opened WeChat and looked for her friend that could save her from despair. Ye Yun was a dignified white-collar worker! She was an elite who had worked in foreign companies for many years. Furthermore, she often attended overseas meetings too.</p>
<p>“Yunyun, are you watching Yaoyao’s live broadcast? Help me get the takeout, and I’ll treat you as my biological sister and do whatever you want in the future!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye had no other hobbies. She liked writing novels but writing too much tired her mind. This was why she liked watching variety shows and TV series that don’t require her using her brain in her spare time. Back then, she fell madly in love with Yu Yaoyao watching ‘In the Limelight’. Her playful and strong character gave herself a lot of creative inspiration.</p>
<p>Since then, Yaoyao became her favorite artist! Later, she also fell in love with Little Bun! The man in this family, President Shen, was even the male protagonist of her novel!</p>
<p>Ever since Fang Qiuyue became a fan of Yaoyao’s family, she had been very into it. When she didn’t feel like coding, she would manage the fan base, edit photos and make short videos, make emoticons… she was down to doing everything for them. For her, this was true love.</p>
<p>Therefore, she had to get the takeaway. Eating it once was not enough. It would be best if she could eat it every day!</p>
<p>“You know what… I wrote 20,000 words the last time I ate the takeout made by Yaoyao… 20,000 words…that usually took me four days! My brain must have exploded because I was so excited that day! Inspiration was gushing out, and I couldn’t even feel the tiredness in my fingers!” Fang Qiuye gushed. “You have to help me, please! I’ll invite you to dinner once I get paid for the manuscript!”</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s avatar on WeChat was now different. She used the photo of Little Bun in his dinosaur costume.</p>
<p>A response from Ye Yun came in quickly.</p>
<p>“I want half of the takeaway,” the message said.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye immediately bit her own tongue. She wanted half of the delicious lunch made by Yaoyao?! Nooooo… did Ye Yun want to suck out half of her blood?</p>
<p>Watching the live broadcast, Fang Qiuye found that someone’s call had already gone through. The person even had a conversation with Yaoyao from thousands of miles away. A conversation!</p>
<p>Oh my god, it was neither just a signed photo, nor was it just a random takeout order. It was a chance to communicate with Yaoyao!</p>
<p>Although the caller chatted a lot, Fang Qiuye could only understand one-tenth of it. But she was so jealous. Why didn’t she practice speaking English back then?</p>
<p>But half a minute later—</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, dear… I don’t quite understand, um…” Yaoyao’s blushing face immediately appeared on the screen. “Uh, can you speak slower? Sorry~”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye covered her mouth. So her idol’s English level turned out to be like hers? Yaoyao wasn’t that good at English?</p>
