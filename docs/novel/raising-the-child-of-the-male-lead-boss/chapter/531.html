            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 231 – Treatment of A Rival Company (1)</strong></p>
<p>After they got in the car, Ni Yi turned to face Yu Yaoyao and started talking happily to her, “Sis, the way you handled yourself yesterday, the tricks you did and how you interacted with some netizens on Weibo, was done really well!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi held her phone in her hand and looked at Yu Yaoyao admiringly as she talked. “You got 30 thousand or 40 thousand more followers yesterday, in just one night!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was interacting with many people on Weibo last night and a lot of netizens saw her postings and spontaneously followed her because of her charm.</p>
<p>“Now your reputation on the internet is very good, they were all touched by what you did, and think that the love between you and the boss is really rare in this world!  They say that your relationship is beyond money and profits, and that you two are true companions!” Ni Yi concluded after he finished.</p>
<p>“I know a friend from the marketing department. Even he said that the rom-com scripts written by the company aren’t as good as yours. That was incredible!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled brightly when she heard her followers increased. Yet she pointed out a problem in his words, “Those weren’t tricks, just so you know. I was being sincere.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi twitched his mouth nervously, “…Yeah, those were all your true feelings.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded.</p>
<p>Ni Yi continued to report, “And there were several articles published based on the press conference you and the boss participated in yesterday. Sis, you’ll probably keep getting more attention these days, and the funny way you talk…I mean, your true self, has completely attracted everyone’s attention, even the keyboard warriors are on your side now.”</p>
<p>Even Chen Jiao’s biggest fans didn’t come out and attack Yu Yaoyao this time. And the reason was, she was just too hilarious. She talked about Chen Jiao interfering her sex life in the night, and told Chen Jiao to find a girlfriend, otherwise do push-ups to consume energy at night…</p>
<p>It was such a direct, unfiltered attack that even keyboard warriors were left speechless. Furthermore, normal people would simply take that as a joke, nobody would actually bash her for this. Therefore, the battle that broke out last night, finished in favor of Yu Yaoyao’s complete victory!</p>
<p>“Chen Jiao is in a worse shape now. Even if he shows up with a girl who looked like his girlfriend today, everyone attacked him in the comments, and say that he must have paid for an entry on the trending list, releasing his relationship on purpose to distract everybody’s attention. The public opinion towards him is almost one-sided, and it’s not good for him.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>His boss implied in the press conference that<em> ‘this is a big world and he has the freedom to go anywhere’</em>. Were it not for the tricks Yu Yaoyao did, the public might just forgive Chen Jiao, and didn’t think it was a big deal that he left.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao first tried to get people on their side to look favorably at the company for her husband, and next accompanied him to the press conference, facing the difficult ordeal with smiles on their faces and always accompanying him. She then claimed that she would be the next best actress, and made a harmless joke with the reporters at the end.</p>
<p>Her refusal to leave, and likewise adamant persistence to stay with her husband stirred the public’s heart more, compared to Chen Jiao’s exit from the company. It was the talk of the town for the whole day. Chen Jiao didn’t need to say anything more, but that image of a diligent, kind, and cheerful good man had gone away forever in many people’s hearts.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Yu Yaoyao had portrayed an even better image than the public relations company could do for them: she did it by appearing like a normal and relatable person, unfiltered and unabashed.</p>
<p>“Sis, there were six offers for you this morning!” Ni Yi’s little eyes popped out wildly. “Not only did you not receive any negative influence, but also received more attention! Two talk shows, one cooking competition, and three heroines in dramas have been sent in the mail. I’ll ask them for the scripts first, then we’ll go through them closely together and then make a decision.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yu Yaoyao’s eyes sparkled as well, she imagined the heaps of money she could earn, she could even see those bills flying towards her!</p>
<p>“Awesome!” She swung her arms in the air and then slapped them on her lap excitedly. “I already said yesterday, but I am pretty awesome!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi laughed when hearing this. He might question her before, but now he wouldn’t, so he nodded his head in agreement. “Yes, sis, you’re greater than Chen Jiao! You’ll surpass him one day, and make Guangxin back to the top again!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao also nodded happily, but she then awkwardly stopped and turned to face Ni Yi with a contemplative expression in her face and said, “You can accept whatever offers you think are appropriate, but the cooking competition…. Well, let’s forget about it. Unless… they would give me the ingredients themselves, and allow me to take other people’s dishes home, then I’ll consider.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi did not respond.</p>
<p>The rest of the time, Yu Yaoyao was reading the script and eating a cucumber in the car. And beside her Ni Yi was going through the offers over and over, considering which to take.</p>
<p>After a while, the assistant poked him. The assistant was a girl who just graduated, and worked for their company because she always loved browsing entertainment news, and the dream job was to work with the stars.</p>
<p>“What?” Ni Yi asked with a snap.</p>
<p>“Yi, Chen Jiao just signed that Film Academy girl.” The assistant lowered her voice, “He made a clarification, and announced that he got her a heroine role in a detective drama.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s eyed instantly bulged, “Heroine? This girl has a background in acting?”</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao came back to the business, she hadn’t even played a leading role yet!</p>
