<p><strong>Chapter 398</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>She had cut off all snacks in the past few months to lose weight and build muscle. She either had salad with boiled chicken breast, or stewed beef with milk. Her meals were much lighter than before.</p>
<p>She felt that she hadn’t gotten enough nutrients lately, so it was normal for her period to be late. She didn’t even pause to consider that she may be pregnant with a second baby.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt helpless after listening to her explanation.</p>
<p>The doctor nodded. “Take a walk if you find you have a bad, or no appetite. If you start feeling nauseous, come back from a follow-up visit. From what I’ve heard, you’re still eating well, especially in the morning. For now, I don’t think you need any medication.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded in a daze.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s expression changed several times before he finally squeezed out his question, “Doctor, she has been filming an action movie which requires fighting. Will this affect the baby?” His heart beat wildly as he finally asked the question that had been bothering him the entire time. He had never been this nervous in his entire life. Not even when he’d first become a father! “Does she need to be hospitalized for observation? Does she have to suspend her work and be in bed for this period?” Shen Yichong asked before the doctor could even answer his first question.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao widened her eyes at these questions.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was right. She had been in the crew for more than a month. During this time, she had either been crawling, fighting, chasing someone, or was being chased.</p>
<p>She rubbed her belly anxiously. “Doctor, are you sure you didn’t take the wrong report? I really don’t feel anything at all. I don’t feel any pain in my stomach.”</p>
<p>The doctor had no choice but to interrupt them, since he didn’t have the time to answer all their questions. “Don’t worry. Everything shows that the baby is in a good condition. Right now, it’s all about biology and natural selection. If there was something wrong with the baby, your body would have had a spontaneous abortion with the month. Since that hasn’t happened, there are clearly no problems, and the baby is healthy. Just do regular pregnancy check-ups. If you feel unwell, come to the emergency room. You should work moderately and relax. And avoid strenuous exercise.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong calmed down a little. “Okay, thank you doctor. Can you tell me a little more about what she should be eating and any follow-up arrangements?”</p>
<p>The doctor told him a lot, but he wasn’t really listening.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the doctor repeated it for a second time and Chen Lin had recorded the whole thing that he finally fell into the belated joy of being a father-to-be. He was even more excited and happier than the first time Yu Yaoyao had been pregnant.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao covered her stomach nervously when she saw all the paparazzi standing outside the hospital when they left. But they didn’t even look at her. They all went and surrounded Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, in what way are you feeling unwell?”</p>
<p>“There are rumors that you’re here to be treated for infertility.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was shocked</p>
<p>But Chen Lin managed to maintain order. “Please make way. We don’t accept interviews in public places. Please give us some space.”</p>
<p>With a serious expression, Shen Yichong held Yu Yaoyao close to him, protecting her the whole way. Finally, they managed to get out the crowds and into the car.</p>
<p>Even though they refused to answer, the paparazzi already had wild ideas and active imaginations.</p>
<p>Several hot topics were released at once:</p>
<p>#Mr. Shen is suspected to be infertile. He left the hospital with such a serious expression#</p>
<p>#He was holding Yu Yaoyao the whole time, seeking comfort for sure#</p>
<p>#Mr. Shen was walking slowly and is suspected to be in a serious condition#</p>
<p>The fans were all anxious after reading these reports.</p>
<p>Safely back at home, Yu Yaoyao laughed out loud when she read the reports.</p>
<p>The rumors were finally dispelled after Shen Yichong asked the Public Relations Department to write a draft to refute them.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong became extremely anxious and careful the moment they returned home. “We won’t announce it yet. Tomorrow, I’ll go with you to Director Liang to discuss future scenes.”</p>
<p>After reading the precautions several times on the way back, he called the housekeeper and helpers one by one and gave them orders.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was feeling quite dizzy, and so she just left him do what he wanted. But it didn’t stop there. She soon realized that Shen Yichong was constantly thinking about the pregnancy. He treated her like a fragile flower and let her enter the rest period.</p>
<p>For the rest of the script, the standing scenes were changed to sitting, and the sitting ones changed to lying down.</p>
<p>Even screenwriter Liu, who got the news from Shen Yichong, personally came to the crew. She smiled as she modified the plot paragraphs on the spot, according to Yu Yaoyao’s physical condition.</p>
<p>Until the end of the shooting, only the director and screenwriter would know about her condition.</p>
<p>And every day when they returned home, Shen Yichong was so nervous that even Little Bun started picking up on it.</p>
<p>Only when Yu Yaoyao was four months pregnant would he finally get to know that he was going to be a big brother.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was afraid of the instability of the second child and had dared not tell his son anything before. He was afraid that Little Bun would affect Yu Yaoyao’s emotions.</p>
<p>But in the end, Little Bun figured it out.</p>
<p>“Dad, something’s been wrong with you recently.” Little Bun took out his tablet and clicked to the notepad screen. “The number of times you look at Mommy’s belly every day has risen sharply. The week before last, you looked an average of ten times per meal. Last week, an average of twenty times per meal. This week… more than ten times…” As Little Bun spoke, he stretched out his hands towards Yu Yaoyao’s belly.</p>
