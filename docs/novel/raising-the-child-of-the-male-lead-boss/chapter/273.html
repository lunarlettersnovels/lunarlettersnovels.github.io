            <p><strong>Chapter 488</strong></p>
<p>With a ponytail, a tight, black leather jacket, and cowhide boots, her whole body exuded a warning sign that no stranger should approach her.  After leaving the building, she hopped on a motorcycle and rode away.</p>
<p>“Awww!”</p>
<p>“Oh my god!”</p>
<p>“Yaoyao~”</p>
<p>“She’s so cool!”</p>
<p>“The screen is about to explode! This close-up!”</p>
<p>The fans couldn’t hold it anymore. They started making all kinds of strange noises. Although the heroine was someone with serious moral problems, the fans couldn’t help but fall in love with the character because it was performed by Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Look at her chapped lips!” Fang Qiuye grabbed Ye Yun next to her. “I really want to be her lip balm~”</p>
<p>Because she wrote ridiculous praises for Yu Yaoyao every day, she spoke such cheeky words without thinking.</p>
<p>Gong Xuechang: “…”</p>
<p>The movie continued to play. The heroine, Xiao Yi, soon met her new neighbor, a tall and bright boy who loved to laugh. She had never seen such a dazzling smile in her life before.</p>
<p>She grew up with an alcoholic father. Her mother gambled and committed suicide by jumping off a building in the end. She was then admitted to an orphanage, and was later adopted by an informant, who trained her to be an assassin for hire.Her daily routine then became only training and killing.</p>
<p>Faces of people crying and begging for mercy in fear were all too familiar to her, but she had not seen such a brilliant smile. Xiao Yi was unknowingly attracted to this boy. She would even secretly watch the boy paint the mural on her balcony when she didn’t have to go out to work.</p>
<p>The boy also began to notice her. Several times at night, he would ask her if she wanted to join him for supper. Ever since she started her mission, Xiao Yi has not shared a meal with anyone.</p>
<p>No one was worth her trust. She might fail her mission or lose her life because of them. However, she unexpectedly agreed to the other party this time. In her eyes that had always been indifferent and without a trace of emotion, a faint light was clearly ignited. It flickered and later became brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>“Noooooooo! Don’t promise him! He’s lying to you!”</p>
<p>“Sis, run away! He’s here to catch you!”</p>
<p>“No! You can’t fall for him!”</p>
<p>“This bad guy! How dare he take advantage of her feelings! It might be better to just arrest her directly!””</p>
<p>“I know this guy wants to wipe out the whole organization behind her, but are there no other methods he could use? It’s so frustrating to imagine how sad and desperate our sis would be when she finally finds out the truth!”</p>
<p>“Does our sis die in the end? No please…I’m begging the screenwriter!”</p>
<p>“She would definitely get a life sentence if she escaped the death penalty! Might be better off dead! Ahh!”</p>
<p>As the fans in the cinema witnessed Xiao Yi gradually falling in love, they all let out a miserable roar. The atmosphere of the entire venue was depressed and tense.</p>
<p>Director Liang sitting in the front row found the situation very amusing. Before they even reached the saddest part, the fans were already acting like the heroine had already died. Their action made him a bit confused as a director. However, it was true that the heroine was destined to die. Films must be reviewed, and all criminal characters can never escape legal punishment.</p>
<p>He and the screenwriter had been trying to bring out different sides to the heroine from the very beginning. He wanted to show that someone so hated must have experienced desolation in their lives. He wanted the heroine to touch the hearts of the audience and let the audience sympathize with her emotional battles and triumphs.</p>
<p>Now, it seemed that his approach had achieved some success. Yu Yaoyao’s acting ability has matured after her many previous works. As the plot progressed, she showed Xiao Yi’s struggle and shyness when she first found out her feelings. She described her inferiorities and the pain she felt inside her, as well as how her indifferent world gradually began to collapse…</p>
<p>She realized that there wouldn’t be a good ending between her and the boy. Her hands were painted in blood. His hands created beautiful paintings.</p>
<p>She didn’t deserve him.</p>
<p>After realizing that, her gaze returned to the darkness and dead silence. Until… She decided she wanted to quit everything and began living a normal life. When she took up her last mission, she learned that her target was the boy she fell in love with.</p>
<p>Only then did she realize how filthy and wrong her work was.</p>
<p>But because of that, she was given a chance to do something for him. Maybe it was the last favor she could do for him! She chose to betray the buyer and protect him.</p>
<p>A series of barely-concealed sobbing sounded throughout the cinema. The audience could not hold back their tears even if they wanted to. Fang Qiuye, who was sitting in the back position, was already in tears at this moment. A plastic bag she held was already full of used tissue!</p>
<p>When Xiao Yi was alive, she was neither happy nor unhappy. She had never felt love and never knew the meaning and value of life. But in the end, she somehow understood what it meant to be sad, and she even did something that made her happy. She also found her own value.</p>
<p>In fact, she was aware of their odd and tense relationship. She knew that he didn’t approach her because he was attracted to her. She was deceiving herself just to be with him…</p>
<p>D*mn love! It was bittersweet!</p>
<p>At the end of the film, the old-fashioned and classic ending appeared. Xiao Yi took the initiative to surrender to the police station, and even gave information of her accomplices. Before she could obtain a reprieve from death or even a commutation of her sentence, she took a bullet for the boy. When Xiao Yi finally closed her eyes with a smile, Fang Qiuye, who had already burst into tears, let out a wail.</p>
<p>“There really isn’t any good man in this world…!”</p>
<p>Teacher Gong: “!”</p>
