            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 52 – Bathing with Mom</strong></p>
<p>Just one second ago, his dark eyes were locked in a glaring competition with his father as they argued. But now, they were looking at Yu Yaoyao with some disbelief and a hit of inexplicable shyness.</p>
<p>The little, fat, white hand holding the plushie instantly tightened its hold, nervous to the point that his little, pink fingernails were almost squashing the serpent’s head.</p>
<p>His mom kissed him?</p>
<p>Furthermore, she even said she wanted to bathe him?</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the corners of his mouth could not stop tilting up.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at his varying expressions from longing to fear and finally the faint giddiness present in the child’s eyes, and she could not help but feel warm inside.</p>
<p><em>It’s quite a strange feeling.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was probably because they were related by blood, or it was the kind of maternal love that sprung after being alone in a cage for so long, without a child of her own and she could only look on at mothers with their own children.</p>
<p>She could not help but discard the papers on the table, shifting her focus on the steamed bun.</p>
<p>She placed him on her lap and said, “Kick your dad out and come bathe with mommy, okay?”</p>
<p>“Mommy takes a bath alone and she feels very lonely, ah. Little Ruirui, please spend more time with mommy. Because mommy has no food to eat, she has to go to work tomorrow and be separated from her baby. How very miserable! But when she comes home, mommy will take a bath with the baby, okay?”</p>
<p>This steamed bun is similar to the old her. She once didn’t dare to say anything that was truly at the bottom of her heart. And this steamed bun, obviously wants his mommy, not a nanny, but he was fearful to bring it up—afraid to be rejected by his own mom.</p>
<p>In fact, she had always wanted to tell the zookeeper that she preferred to soak in the water pool near the restaurant rather than be washed harshly by a water hose.</p>
<p>However, the pool was currently in a state disrepair, thus the quality of the water was not suitable for her skin. There was also the fact that the zookeepers were not diligent enough to clean it up.</p>
<p>And if she protests, the zookeeper will only believe that she wants to pee.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, no matter what expression she made at that time and how she twisted soberly on the ground, the zookeeper couldn’t understand what she had meant.</p>
<p>Oh, it makes her sad every time she thinks of it!</p>
<p>“Let’s go, shall we go and see if the pajamas are dried?” Yu Yaoyao picked up the steamed bun on her lap and carried him together to the laundry room.</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who had been watching her as she read the competition rules, never dared to interrupt, but in the end, he was completely left behind in the living room.</p>
<p>He wiped his sweat that had rolled down in a hurry, but when he looked at Shen Yichong, his legs trembled badly.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak, but not even a squeak would come out. Only after a while was he able to whisper, “B-boss, I’ll go first.”</p>
<p>As he silently crept out, he remembered an important matter and said, “C-could you also please convey this message that I’ll pick up Sister Yu at seven the day after tomorrow?”</p>
<p>He dared not disturb their sweet world of three again!</p>
<p>He can see that despite the boss’ cold demeanor and stoic expression, he still dearly takes care of his family.</p>
<p>Had it not been for him—an unwanted third guest, then he would have been able to take a bath together as a family!</p>
<p>Thinking about it, Ni Yi shivered.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded to him and impassively replied, “I’ll remind her.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi fled the scene at once.</p>
<p>After a while, there was a cheer from the laundry room from both the mother and son, Yu Yaoyao and the steamed bun.</p>
<p><em>My dragon pajamas are dry! </em>He joyfully thought.</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s his mouth froze, and he quickly lifted his feet upstairs in a hurry. As if with one slow step, the pair would find him and force him to wear that hideous dinosaur onesie.</p>
<p>But unbeknownst to him, he was actually overthinking things too much.</p>
<p>Because as soon as Shen Rui took his freshly dried pajamas, his mom brought him to the bathroom together with his snake plushie. His little butt stark naked and ready for a bath, he had totally forgotten all about his father!</p>
