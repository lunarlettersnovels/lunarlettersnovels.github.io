<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 273 – I’m a Spirit (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was indeed tired. The entire night had been anxiety-inducing and exciting. When she woke up, her entire body ached. Her waist and her legs were sore, and her mouth was swollen. She still felt sleepy and exhausted. The dazzling sunlight poured into the room and a warm voice filled the air. “It’s time to get up,” Shen Yichong said.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoayo turned to the other side and buried her head underneath several pillows. “I have requested for the breakfast to be sent to the room,” he said, “you can wash up first.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao tried to move a little, but the soreness engulfed her. She hummed and refused to move. The coat still covered the live camera, and the microphone was nowhere to be seen since Shen Yichong had torn it away last night. He had unplugged the cameras too.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong moved the pillows away and stroked her forehead. “Come now, get up,” he insisted, smiling, “If you don’t, Director Zhao may come looking for you. We don’t need to turn the cameras on, if you don’t want to. But you still need to eat something. Aren’t you hungry?”</p>
<p>From the depths of the pillow, Yu Yaoyao stirred at the mention of food. “Are the audience still there?” she asked, indicating the camera.</p>
<p>“I turned it off,” he replied, “but they will be there if we turn it on and continue filming.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said and looked at herself. She was covered in a set of pyjamas: pinkish long-sleeved nightshirt and trousers. “We can turn it on,” she said, looking at him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong ruffled her hair, straightened her shirt and went to turn on the camera. As soon as the livestream resumed, the viewers started with their fresh set of comments:</p>
<p><strong>【Oh, Y’s finally off the boat! I’ve waited for 12 hours! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【How intense was it last night? She couldn’t even continue filming till now! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Mr. Shen looks to be controlled but is actually an old master! My sis can’t even get off the bed….】</strong></p>
<p>The viewers weren’t really able to see all of the room, as Shen Yichong’s face filled the front of the camera when adjusting the angle, but they had already started with the thirsty comments. When they could finally see, they realized that Yu Yaoyao was still in bed. That was all they needed to fuel their rants on-screen.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong walked over to Yu Yaoyao, clearly wanting to persuade her to get up. “Are you really not hungry?” he asked, “Please eat a little. You can sleep after you eat. Sleep the whole day if you want.” He looked at her worriedly.</p>
<p>Her stomach rumbled. “Ugh, last night’s lobster and abalone have all disappeared!” she grumbled.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong laughed. “I have ordered some porridge for you,” he said, “Also your favourite quiche, poached egg and bacon, shrimp, and fruit salad.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao struggled up from bed but fell back down. “My waist hurts a lot,” she said, scrunching her face, “You used too much force last night and–”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had covered her mouth with his hand before she could say anything more. The comments under the livestream ignited, obviously. “I really can’t get up,” she said woefully.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at her flushed face and tired eyes. She was clearly drained. He felt bad, so he pulled her hands out, tidied her sleeves and massaged her shoulders. He massaged her back and her waist, and her thighs. After a while, when her grumbling stomach could no longer be ignored, she flipped onto her back and stretched. “Hubby,” she called.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” answered Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Am I going to have a baby?” she asked, placing a hand on her belly. “Does it mean I won’t be allowed to jump and eat whatever I want?” she looked at him, nervously. He grasped her hands in his, but before he could respond, a small flurry rushed into the room yelling.</p>
<p>“Mommy!” Shen Rui exclaimed, “Am I gonna have a little sister or a brother?! When?!” Shen Rui was evidently out of his head with excitement to listen to anything at all.</p>
