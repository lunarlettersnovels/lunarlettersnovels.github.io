<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>The internet, however, erupted in outrage at the recent reveal. The news of the ‘blood-sucking’ relatives hounding the innocent actress caused an uproar among the fans. The news of Yu Yaoyao being unfilial to her family was still trending in hot searches, so this new reveal crashed like a wave among all the viewers.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s fans took arms against the news and directed all their rage in the comment section. Her sobbing voice in the recording enraged them further towards her stepmother and sister:</p>
<p>【Is this how a family is supposed to be?! 】</p>
<p>【Where are the so-called mother and sister? They are clearly two big leeches! 】</p>
<p>【After sucking her empty, she still says that her sister isn’t filial enough. Why don’t you go rob the bank instead! 】</p>
<p>【Sister YY is so strong and bold, but they made her actually cry. Really unbearable! These two social scums donning human skin and are passing off as members of a society, yet they’re thick-skinned enough to commit atrocities inferior to even that of dogs and pigs! 】</p>
<p>【Didn’t this girl (YXJ) drop by last time during the live broadcast of “Wife and I”? At that time, I already knew she surely wasn’t a good person! Tapping Sister YY on the side and asking if she has seen the news of Mr. Shen being scolded on the Internet, it was basically to test whether he really went bankrupt enough to the point of not being able to afford good food! It was a case of ‘Oh, to have no more money to exploit in the future, what to do?! 】</p>
<p>【My God, the Detective Conan upstairs! That being said, the entire news and speculation is making my hair stand at an end. Positively horrified! 】</p>
<p>【Regarding her mother, I’ve found some information! Not only is Zhao Mei a stepmother, she’s a homewrecker! She destroyed Yu Yaoyao’s family. Yu Xinjie’s precisely the daughter born out of this illicit relationship! OMG, isn’t Sister YY’s a human reincarnation of Cinderella?! The vicious stepmother and younger sister didn’t let go of her even after she after her marriage! 】</p>
<p>【This family is going to hell! Our Sister Y Y’s biological father, is he dead or blind? He even bargained for benefits, didn’t hesitate in selling off his own blood-related daughter for said benefits! 】</p>
<p>The fans and viewers rallied in support of Yu Yaoyao and condemned her maiden family. The voice of those who accused Yu Yaoyao for her selfish emotions were overwhelmed. Many others saw the news and dug up information on Yu Yaoyao’s family and Yu Yaoyao herself. Many found the controversies and negative news related to Yu Xinjie and Zhao Mei.</p>
<p>Many fans saw that Yu Xinjie liked to show off her wealth. They dug out photos of her draped in luxurious brands. The total amounted to tens of thousands of bucks. The viewers wrote articles that compared Yu Xinjie and her extravagant lifestyle to Yu Yaoyao’s early days where she was barely getting by while supporting her family.</p>
<p>This further infuriated the fans, who expressed their rage in the comments:</p>
<p>【Look! The black-hearted sister stripped her elder sister’s money to buy super luxury goods! After the elder sister returned to work, she could only wear a cheap small brand outfit, and the backpack was just over 1,000 yuan. That day, the tabloid questioned the low-end appearance of the rich and famous YY. So this was the reason! 】</p>
<p>【Vicious sister not only gnaws the parents, but also gnaws the elder sister! Is this to overtake her sister’s closet for herself! ? If I didn’t know any better, I would’ve thought that Yu Xinjie was the rich wife of the two! 】</p>
<p>【How can you wear your elder sister’s designer clothes ORZ…]</p>
<p>The fans didn’t stop there. They skimmed the posts from several years ago which accused Yu Yaoyao of cheating and found that Yu Xinjie had liked and bumped up the posts to defame Yu Yaoyao. They shamed her for being a ‘wolf under a sister’s skin’.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In the duplex villa, Yu Xinjie broke down and slipped on the floor, crying and trembling. “Mom, what should I do, what should I do…,” she stammered, sobbing, “I can’t face people anymore.”</p>
<p>“Xinjie, listen to me,” said Zhao Mei, “You still have a little bit of money left. Go abroad for a few years until this goes down. Your sister has ruined your reputation. People just need time to forget or turn to something else. We won’t pay the money back; you will go live abroad where no one knows you. Come back in two years’ time….” Zhao Mei was trying to hug her. But Yu Xinjie pushed her away.</p>
<p>“Mom!” she exclaimed, “What are you even saying? If we don’t pay everything back, brother-in-law will sue me! Anybody could find out the lawsuit in my name with a simple internet search. Even if I go abroad, no one in the Chinese district will treat me well.”</p>
<p>“I don’t even have the amount that it takes to make a living abroad!” Yu Xinjie continued, “Father’s company doesn’t earn so much either. We will need to sell the house and the beauty salon to pay back.”</p>
<p>Zhao Mei frowned; she looked unwilling. Yu Xinjie noticed this. She looked at her mother and tears flowed anew from her eyes.</p>
<p>“Mummy,” she said in disbelief, “Even if I were to be sued, you won’t sell the house and the salon to pay them back?”</p>
<p>Zhao Mei sneered. “You brat! What are you even saying?” she said, “We don’t have anything! We don’t have any money at home. It was your sister who gave us the money voluntarily. Didn’t you say we don’t even need to pay it back when you last received it? Will it even be a legal issue anyway?!”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie shook her head in disbelief. This was her mother? She covered her face in her face and heaved a breath. She stood up and pushed Zhao Mei aside and rushed to her bedroom.</p>
<p>“Where are the real estate documents?” she said, searching frantically through the drawers, “Where is the registration certificate for the beauty salon? I am going to sell it all and pay them back!”</p>
