<p><strong>Chapter 355</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>That was… Ling Shuang?</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hadn’t been able to recognize her. Even if she had taken off her wig and wiped the dust from her face, she still wouldn’t have recognized her.</p>
<p>This person who looked neither human nor ghost had been Ling Shuang?</p>
<p>“That level of makeup is very realistic,” Yu Yaoyao said softly as she touched her chest. She was still feeling a little scared from the incident. “Her face looked swollen, as if she’d had a beating and even her eyebags were wonderfully done… There was even dirt under her nails… The makeup was all so real,” Yu Yaoyao had always been a good observer.</p>
<p>At the moment, Ling Shuang was struggling desperately to escape the strong grasp of the men. Even though Ling Shuang’s face was turned away, Yu Yaoyao was still able to see the desolation in her.</p>
<p>“Her face is so disfigured!” Yu Yaoyao said, easily and accurately summing up her appearance.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang almost wanted to vomit blood when she heard what Yu Yaoyao said. “Yu Yaoyao, don’t be so proud! Let me tell you, I wouldn’t admit defeat to you even though you have taken my role away! When my brother Chen Jiao is done with the crew, he will seek justice for me! All those disgraceful things you did will all be exposed!” Ling Shuang screamed frantically. But in the end, the security guards dragged her away when she wasn’t focusing.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was taken aback. “What? I took your role? The role of a beggar? I wouldn’t want it even if you gave it to me.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang turned her head angrily. She stared at her and said, “You bit…” One of the guards covered her mouth before she could finish her sentence and hauled her back to the set.</p>
<p>It was pure coincidence that the two crews were located so close together. Curiously, Yu Yaoyao followed them to see what was going on.</p>
<p>She was just in time to see Ling Shuang being thrown in front of the camera, and a bunch of homeless guys started furiously kicking at her.</p>
<p>Halfway through the kick, the director called a cut, “Not good enough! Do it again!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s mouth opened in wonder as she watched.</p>
<p>In a short span of time, the director called for a cut at least five or six more times.</p>
<p>“Have you not eaten enough? Do it better! You guys are here to vent your anger after drinking! Again! The angle is not good! The one on the floor isn’t even showing her face! Again!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blinked and hissed in sympathy. It looked painful!</p>
<p>“Teacher Yu?” A kind-looking woman with short hair approached her. “Hello. I apologize for my artist’s insensitive words. She was rude to you. I’ll teach her a lesson.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pointed at Ling Shuang.</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s her. I’m sorry,” the woman said.</p>
<p>“Oh! It’s okay. She didn’t manage to say much, and I also scolded her right after that.” Yu Yaoyao had always been a person who fought back when someone attacked her for no reason. She never stayed kind to people who intentionally hurt her. But she also felt that the manager wasn’t a good person either. Would a normal person allow their artists to be beaten up like this?</p>
<p>She also realized that Ling Shuang hadn’t been wearing makeup. Her face really had been beaten like that.</p>
<p>“I’ll make a move first. Bye,” Yu Yaoyao waved her hand and left.</p>
<p>She didn’t care what happened to Ling Shuang. She had nothing to do with her, and didn’t hold any warmth for her. She didn’t even want to look at her. This shallow bitch was trying to be the mistress of her husband anyway.</p>
<p>Finally, Ling Shuang managed to gasp. For the entire ordeal of being kicked, she had been in front of the camera. She saw Guo Li and Yu Yaoyao talking and laughing together. They even pointed at her while they spoke.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang stayed on the ground, but she managed to raise her head through the pain. Her eyes were filled with hatred.</p>
<p>After the scene, the director was talking to the other actors, and the two brawny men were smoking. No one cared enough to step forward and help her up. Ling Shuang gritted her teeth, took a few deep breaths, and got up off the ground. She used all her strength and charged towards Yu Yaoyao, who had just turned and walked away.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, it was you who wanted me hurt! You worked with this bitch, Guo Li, to land me in this role! Yu Yaoyao, you are evil and cruel! You are not good enough for big brother Shen!” she screamed as she frantically grabbed Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>But she didn’t get far. Guo Li grabbed her. Her other wrist was held by a strong hand, and she was then knocked to the ground. The broken bowl in her hand narrowly avoided scratching Yu Yaoyao’s arm.</p>
<p>“You freaking…!” Ling Shuang cursed.</p>
<p>She raised her head as she cursed, but then quickly covered her gray, scarred face with one hand. The fire in her eyes quickly faded, and she began to panic. The inferiority she felt made her want to dig a hole and hide in it.</p>
<p>The person who had pushed her down was Shen Yichong himself.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang turned around to flee. She didn’t want to appear in front of her sweetheart in such a desperate state. But a gentle, caring voice soon sounded in her ears.</p>
<p>“Are you frightened?” Shen Yichong’s low voice was magnetic.</p>
<p>In an instant, Ling Shuang’s knees grew weak, and the base of her ears turned hot. She turned her head to look at him; only to feel as though a dagger had been driven into her heart.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong gently took Yu Yaoyao’s waist, and his eyes were soft and warm.</p>
<p>But in the next second, cold eyes full of disgust fell on her. “I don’t mind helping out if you can’t educate your artist,” Shen Yichong said.</p>
