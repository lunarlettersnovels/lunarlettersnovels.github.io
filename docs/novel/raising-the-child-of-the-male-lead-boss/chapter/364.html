            <p><strong>Chapter 399</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Little Bun was not impressed by his father’s behavior. Much like a small adult, he crossed his fair, plump arms sulkily over his chest.</p>
<p>How dare his father hide the news from him for more than a month! He found he was quite upset by this. He was a brother-to-be and it had taken him this long to find out about it.</p>
<p>“Dad, you said earlier that I’m a functional member of this family. And as a young man in this family, I have to be responsible, face difficulties and take care of Mommy… But you hid such important news from a member of your family. Why? How can I trust you?”</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>He didn’t know how to explain to his son that he was worried about Yu Yaoyao’s condition, and that he feared the baby wouldn’t be strong enough after her intense acting scenes. So, he just ended up staying silent. He didn’t want his son to worry about it.</p>
<p>But his son’s careful observation had put him on the spot and exposed him. He didn’t know what the right choice was.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, patted Little Bun on the shoulder with a smile. “Baby, Daddy didn’t hide the news from you on purpose. You’re about to celebrate your birthday, aren’t you? Dad wanted to give you a big surprise and make you happy. He wanted to wait until then.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong breathed a sigh of relief. He immediately nodded, agreeing to what his wife said.</p>
<p>Little Bun glanced at his father suspiciously. Then, he bowed his head and calculated something on his fingers. Suddenly, the corners of his pink lips rose. “It’s only a few more days until my birthday! Daddy…” He pursed his lips and reached out towards Shen Yichong. He hugged his father, patting him on the shoulder as he said, “Sorry for misunderstanding you, Daddy. I thought you wanted my little sister all to yourself, and that you wouldn’t let me play with her.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched again, but he bent over and hugged his son’s small body. “Daddy was wrong,” he said softly.</p>
<p>And just like that, father and son were reconciled.</p>
<p>Little Bun’s mood quickly picked up. His curiosity and hopeful eyes immediately turned to Yu Yaoyao’s belly. He stared fixedly at her stomach with his dark eyes. He wanted to reach out and touch it, but he didn’t dare.</p>
<p>“How long till my sister comes out? Did I used to be like this too? Did I only come out after growing up in Mommy’s belly?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong grabbed his small hand and placed it softly on Yu Yaoyao’s belly.</p>
<p>Her baby bump wasn’t obvious yet, but there was still a slight difference. Her usually flat belly had grown that little bit bigger.</p>
<p>Shen Rui was very careful with his touch. “I’ll be gentle. I won’t hurt my sister. Is she sleeping? Will she roll around like I do? Is she snoring like the housekeeper?” He was so happy at the thought of being a brother.</p>
<p>Then he was suddenly asking a thousand questions. Like how his sister ate, how she slept, what it was like in Yu Yaoyao’s belly, how big she was… And many, many more. He went and found the picture of his first ultrasound on his tablet. He had been no bigger than the size of a red bean then.</p>
<p>With a grim expression on his face, he wondered if his younger sister also looked like this. Or if, perhaps, she was better looking than he’d been.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong answered each of his questions. In the end, he didn’t know whether he wanted to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>Before they settled down for dinner, Little Bun made a very mature agreement with Shen Yichong. “If there’s any news about my sister in the future, we need to share it with each other as soon as possible. Daddy, as the two men in the family, we must not make Mommy tired. Mommy should also eat first so my sister won’t be hungry. Mommy is tired when she gets home from work. We have to massage her legs when she rests. Mommy doesn’t need to take care of the chores at home,” he said seriously as he jotted this all down on his tablet.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong helped him correct his typos.</p>
<p>“I will clean up my own toys so there is nothing on the ground for Mommy to fall over. Daddy, you need to keep your work documents organized. You mustn’t work till late at night, so that Mommy can rest on time.”</p>
<p>After writing out a list of 40 rules, he finally stopped.</p>
<p>“We can add more if there’s anything else in the future.”</p>
<p>He even signed it before passing it to Shen Yichong for his signature. It was one of the things he’d learnt from recording a show with his parents.</p>
<p>The lawyer had come to their house and asked his daddy and mommy to sign some documents.</p>
<p>He didn’t understand it at the time. But he learned from the lawyer that it was called ‘black and white’. People who signed it would then have to keep their promises.</p>
<p>Shen Rui nodded in satisfaction when the document was finally completed. He pointed to the notepad on the tablet and said, “Daddy, how do I make it into paper?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong realized that his son was finally growing up. He felt proud and helpless at the same time.</p>
<p>According to Little Bun’s request, he printed out two contracts.</p>
<p>“Two copies; one for Daddy and one for me,” Little Bun instructed.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao burst out laughing. But she stopped when Little Bun started talking again.</p>
<p>“Mommy, can you not laugh so hard? You’re shaking all over. My little sister in your stomach is going to think it’s an earthquake. Please control yourself, Mommy.” In all his life of treating his mother like a precious treasure, this was the first time Shen Rui had ever made a serious demand of her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately covered her mouth when she heard it. She could do nothing but bury herself in Shen Yichong’s chest and laugh quietly.</p>
<p>“Alright now. Let’s eat.” Shen Yichong quickly helped his wife, who was being reprimanded by their son.</p>
