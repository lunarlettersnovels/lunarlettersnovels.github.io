            <p><strong>Chapter 485.1</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao and Fang Qiuye really formed an English team alliance. A full-time wife and a full-time writer unexpectedly got together. Although Director Zhao won’t be recording their tutoring session, they insisted on learning and practicing (translating) till the end.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye failed to persuade Teacher Gong to actually do the translation, but she received a bunch of English textbooks from him, ranging from translations of acclaimed books overseas and in the domestic market. His intentions were clear. He was begging them to read some thoughtful books.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao was not interested in those. The reason was very simple, she had read them at the zoo long ago. Even if there were some that she liked, she could no longer find the same joy when she first read them. Afterl all, she had already read them several times in the long years she had lived… She would rather read novels!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye naturally prioritized what her idol wanted. Although she felt ashamed to read her own works, she was willing to do it as long as Yaoyao was happy. If her idol was happy, she also felt that her words had become valuable.</p>
<p>So, the two of them carried out the translation to the end. Neither was it for live broadcasts, nor was it for the program. It was purely for the joy of learning.</p>
<p>“Wow, Big Head! Do you think the female supporting role in Dacheng’s book is a little too mentally handicapped? Gosh, I wish I could slap her.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Big Head! Look at the typo Dacheng has here.”</p>
<p>“After Dacheng reaches Chapter V, her writing keeps getting better, and the heroine has become more interesting…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed while looking back at the chapters.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye wished she could record every word in a small notebook, so she could revise them when she got home, or to use them as notes on how to overcome her previous shortcomings next time. After much hardship,  they finally finished translating all the free chapters at a turtle speed.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was an undergraduate, so she had a certain foundation. With the help of the God Baidu Translate, they were able to come out with the translated draft.</p>
<p>Every day, she would post them to her subordinary Weibo account, which was only visible to her friends. Fang Qiuye didn’t want to take advantage of Yaoyao anymore. She had been helping her to publicize her work for free all this while. Her Weibo followers were basically her good friends who had the same writing interest, and some readers who followed her. She had no more than 100 fans. Her subordinary Weibo account was for her to record stuff from time to time.</p>
<p>And just like that, the days passed by. Their English level actually improved to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Soon, it was also the day when Yu Yaoyao’s <em>‘I Am a Killer’ </em>was scheduled to be released. This time, the producer confidently decided that it should be released in the summer.</p>
<p>Director Liang Yujie also called to inquire about Yu Yaoyao and Little Sweetheart’s current situation and to confirm whether she could participate in the premiere. After receiving a negative answer, Liang Yujie could only regrettably ask Yu Yaoyao to record a short video to say hello to the audience, industry experts and actors at the premiere.</p>
<p>In fact, Yu Yaoyao wished she could go, but she had no choice. It was weird but Little Sweetheart would start crying at nine o’clock in the evening, as if she knew that Shen Dacheng was about to update; she would start crying like an alarm clock. And the naughty baby would only stop crying when she was in her mother’s arms.</p>
<p>Since the premiere was also at night, it directly conflicted with Little Sweetheart’s biological clock. Although regretful, Yu Yaoyao could only be at home.</p>
<p>But as the heroine, it was undoubtedly a pity for many fans that she couldn’t be there. Yu Yaoyao was afraid that her fans would stay up all night to buy tickets, or pay a lot of money to scalpers, only to find out that she wasn’t there when they went to the scene. Hence, she had already announced in advance that she couldn’t make it.</p>
<p>Sure enough, all the YY fans were disappointed. Ever since Yu Yaoyao gave birth to Little Sweetheart, she had been out for nearly half a year. Apart from the variety shows that were still being broadcast, there weren’t many programs that they could see her on.</p>
<p>Although this was a common problem faced by the actresses, the fans couldn’t help but feel sad when it happened to their idol.</p>
<p><em>[Sis! May I ask, when will you accept another new shooting? Give me some hope~]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’m watching ‘Youth Without Regrets’ again!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’ve rewatched ‘In the Limelight’ twice!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’ve watched the footage of ‘Chaos’ eight times!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’ve watched ‘Year’ twelve times, who can challenge me!?]</em></p>
<p>As Yu Yaoyao looked at everyone’s comments on Weibo, she felt that she should really start going out.</p>
<p>After the screening of ‘Killer’ was over, she will almost be able to stop breastfeeding Little Sweetheart. By then, she could start picking up some work near home and go back and forth. Ordinary office workers would never have such a long maternity leave like her. She had been resting for a long time.</p>
<p><em>‘Gosh,’ </em>she thought ruefully. Then, “Little Sweetheart, Mommy has an application to you today. Is it alright for me to go out to work~”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao grabbed her daughter’s little hand and gently shook it. Little Sweetheart babbled, not knowing whether it meant agreeing or disagreeing.</p>
<p>“Right, Little Sweetheart must be on Mommy’s side~”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao voted for herself. But after she finished speaking, she slightly frowned, and stretched out her fingers to poke her little girl’s chubby cheek.</p>
