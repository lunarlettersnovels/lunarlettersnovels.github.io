            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 128 – She’s a Foolish Woman</strong></p>
<p>The moment Ni Yi was greeted by the scene before him, he was immediately at a loss for words, he was beyond surprised, if anything. Soon after, the jealous little scream from a toddler sounder from outside the door.</p>
<p>“Dad!” The little bun looked at his parents, his face also that of shock!</p>
<p>His dad just got rid of him because his mommy didn’t want him to get sick. But his dad himself… is eating his mommy’s mouth!</p>
<p>“Mommy is sick! Why are you trying to eat her mouth dad! Are you trying to steal the candy from mommy’s mouth?!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi deeply felt his heart throb against his ribcage and quickly covered the little bun’s mouth. However, he was far too late. Even Chen Lin who stood next to the door heard the little bun’s cry, the picture of a scene unconsciously popping into his mind.</p>
<p><em>Boss has really changed! He’s become a beast!</em> he thought in wonder and fear of him not even sparing his sick wife!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face became dark as the night, his head still crooked towards the woman below him tightly holding to his necktie. He slowly got up and looked back schooling an expressionless mask towards Ni Yi trembling at the door.</p>
<p>“Speak.” His words were brisk, but his face was terrifyingly full of murderous intent. If it were no important matter, Ni Yi would have been evacuated from the hotel.</p>
<p>Although skittish, Ni Yi still spoke in urgency. “Only two minutes ago, Meng Xinran’s fans flooded elder sister Yu’s Weibo! They say elder sister hurt her…”</p>
<p>The bedridden Yu Yaoyao listened, but there were no fluctuations on her expression. When she found out that the little bun had slipped in and was struggling to climb up the edge of her bed, she reached out to haul his little ass up. Not once did she look at Ni Yi with alarm until the little one was safely on the bedside with her.</p>
<p>“Bring me my phone so I can see what her fans have done!”</p>
<p>Although she had fully read this novel, the original Yu Yaoyao had never taken part in the recording for ‘Golden Age Empress’ and the competition for ‘In the Limelight’, and therefore had no encounters with Meng Xinran.</p>
<p>These current evils were something she brought to herself.</p>
<p>Ni Yi glanced at her hesitantly, which made her urge him, “Come on now, I’m tired of talking. Don’t waste my energy…” This made Ni Yi take quick steps, his legs almost tangling beneath him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the little bun laid beside Yu Yaoyao, not interested in the news for the time being. His mommy’s sweet smell and their soft bodies side by side were all that captured his attention. He decided he would search for the news later and laid quietly beside his mommy.</p>
<p>As soon as Yu Yaoyao got ahold of her phone to look at fiasco, she immediately snorted.</p>
<p><em>#Meng Xinran’s withdrawal instigated by Yu Yaoyao</em></p>
<p>She’s part of the hot search again!</p>
<p>[No wonder little Ran withdrew from ‘In the limelight.’ This must be the CEO madam’s secret all along hidden by the show!]</p>
<p>[YYY is terrible! You really cannot judge a person by their looks! Poisonous women are still snakes and scorpions!]</p>
<p>[Foolish Guangxin company, let my little Ran come back!]</p>
<p>A large group of heated fans attacked all posts under the official accounts of Yu Yaoyao, Guangxin entertainment, not even sparing Shen Yichong. Even the potato chip commercial, which had been highly praised before, was now criticized considering the news.</p>
<p>And under the widespread criticism, there was no notice of Meng Xinran.</p>
<p>[My little Ran is okay, right?]</p>
<p>[Shouldn’t have this been taken care already?]</p>
<p>Fans anxiously filled the comments, the internet in total chaos. Yu Yaoyao merely glanced at everyone’s comments in amusement. Looking back at her Weibo account, she found that her fans have already exceeded 800,000.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes that had been squinting immediately closed as she released a peal of laughter.</p>
<p>“Ah, this Meng little flower just bought me a spot in the hot search and gave me some buzz!” She then continued, “Hmm… it seems that I have lost some fans as well. Ah, it’s a pity…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi didn’t even know what to say. After he caught sight of the boss Shen’s gloomy face, he felt that his elder sister was incredibly tough and courageous.</p>
<p>The mobile phone she held was soon taken by Shen Yichong. With just one look, his eyebrows crooked and he spoke in a chilly voice.</p>
<p>“Ni Yi.”</p>
<p>“Here! Here!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at him. Feeling his legs go soft, NI Yi sat on the sofa slowly, feeling as if he were to sank into the mattress.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned deeper, “Why are you panicking? Only a small child should be hot-tempered. Let Chen Lin in and have him contact the police assigned to investigate this case. The culprit has been caught.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi listened with his brows raising by every word.</p>
<p><em>That’s right!</em></p>
<p>Then he caught Yu Yaoyao’s eyes, which were filled with great contempt towards him.</p>
<p>She propped herself up with her arms, sitting up reluctantly. “How nice of me would it be if I didn’t scold that little flower. She insulted me with that photo!”<strong>**</strong></p>
<p><em>**T/N refresher: Back when Meng Xinran released a photo of her in a hotel with another man that immediately went hot search.</em></p>
<p>She stretched out her hand, angrily hitting the quilt as if it were the one who had grievances against her.</p>
<p>“My body has a golden ratio! My legs are more than a meter long!” She continued intensely, “But the woman in the hotel photo has stout legs paired with a long upper body and her breasts are smaller than mine! She wants to engrave the picture of this ugly woman’s dress on my mind! How silly!”</p>
<p>“How can it be me?!” She finally ended her monologue, her face that of despair.</p>
<p>Ni Yi had a dull look in place. “…” While Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was also devastated when they were only silent to her qualms, as if disbelieving her. She stretched out a hand and lifted the quilt from her legs in one aggrieved motion!</p>
<p>“Take a ruler and measure my legs!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt an instant headache. He held down the quilt, swiftly trying to cover her from almost exposing herself. But the little bun lying on the bed was excited to try.</p>
<p>“I am going to help my mother take the ruler! Mommy’s legs are longer than Ruirui’s!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
