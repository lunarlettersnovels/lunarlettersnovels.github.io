            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 32 – Dad, Don’t Disturb Me</strong></p>
<p>Inside the garden villa in Mingxin and on the sofa in the living room, the steamed bun was currently holding a tablet, looking at the video playing on the screen with a very serious expression.</p>
<p>He was still a tiny man, that his legs could not reach the ground, and even his lotus white short hands that held the small tablet had some difficulty holding it upright after some time.</p>
<p>But for an hour, his big, black eyes did not dare blink as he stared at the screen, his mouth pursued to a small line, while his wispy, little eyebrows were wrinkled.</p>
<p>Even if next to him is a platter of his favorite fruits and his beloved milk prepared by his babysitter, he still didn’t touch it.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong got home early, and the first thing he saw was his grumpy son on the sofa. The steamed bun had a bitter expression that held the faint feeling of…a grudge?</p>
<p>He kept walking inside the living room, trying to make his presence known, yet the steamed bun is still completely immersed on the video that he wasn’t even able to notice his father had come back.</p>
<p>And as the video progressed, the tender eyebrows wrinkled tightly by the minute, and his small mouth got more distorted. In the end, his whole face was the epitome of worry and anger, with his two little fists clenched firmly on the small tablet.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised an eyebrow and said, “What are you looking at?”</p>
<p>As if caught red-handed doing something bad, the steamed bun immediately hid the tablet behind him. Obviously, he was with a guilty conscience—he refused to show it to his father.</p>
<p>But his stubby hands were careless, and accidentally touched the volume up button. Instantly, the angry roar of the man in the video could be heard in the whole living room.</p>
<p>“Have you truly never fallen in love with me? From the very beginning until today?!”</p>
<p>Soon after, the familiar voice of a woman answered, “12345…”</p>
<p>The man’s voice replied again!</p>
<p>“You will always love only yourself!”</p>
<p>“123123…”</p>
<p>The woman repeated again, her voice neither rising in pitch.</p>
<p>“Mu Yiyi, let’s break up! ”</p>
<p>“123…”</p>
<p>The steamed bun almost went down on all fours with his buttocks up to the air as he scrambled for the small tablet in a hurry.</p>
<p>He tried to turn the volume down, however, with his short fingers in panic, he could not press the right button! And ultimately turned the volume higher!</p>
<p>He angrily covered the screen with its protective case and locked the screen!</p>
<p>And as if nothing had transpired, he tucked the tablet under the pillow next to him and calmly looked at his father, who had been staring at him all this time.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at his son’s expression and couldn’t help but squeeze his eyebrows.</p>
<p>After he had listened to a few words from the video, he immediately knew what the matter was all about.</p>
<p>It was from the wedding clip of a modern love drama that Yu Yaoyao had starred in, where her acting scandal originated—she had read the lines together with the numbers and was exposed online by the production crew.</p>
<p>This became the biggest acting scandal of that year.</p>
<p>The director of the film was Li Bo.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at that video?” he looked helplessly at his son.</p>
<p>He did not expect Yu Yaoyao to be so irresponsible before he was married to her.</p>
<p>But the couple had a son soon after they got married, and even he wanted a divorce, he had to take into account how it would impact his son. After he was born, his mother had run away from home and the child grew up never feeling maternal love. He didn’t want his son to go through another ordeal.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was locked up at home for five years in order to put a stop to her infamous acting career, and to deal with the unfavorable public opinion on her…but mostly to avoid letting his son grow psychologically broken due to these family matters.</p>
<p>But he did not expect that after Ni Yi said a sentence today, his son would go rummaging in the internet for old videos of his mother.</p>
<p>The steamed bun thought he wasn’t aware and tried to protect his mother?</p>
<p>“Dad, you still haven’t washed your hands after you came in.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui, the steamed bun, pouted and cleverly changed the topic at once.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong merely replied with an unwavering look.</p>
<p>Shen Rui suddenly picked up a children’s picture book left on the coffee table, and unexpectedly put on the front of <em>‘I am reading carefully, father do not disturb me’ </em>expression.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Shen Yichong, who decided not to expose his son’s trick, turned and went up to the second floor.</p>
