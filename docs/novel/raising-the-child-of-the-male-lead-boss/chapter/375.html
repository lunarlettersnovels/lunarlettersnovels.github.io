<p><strong>Chapter 388</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>He spoke anxiously before she could even get a word in. “Xiao Yao, I have something urgent to discuss with you. Let’s first talk about business. I want to invite you to star in the film ‘First Aid’. Put aside all personal matters between us and give it a second thought. I can send you the detailed script. I think you’ll like it when you take a look at the script. This role is challenging…”</p>
<p>He heard her talking softly on the other end of the phone before he even finished speaking. It sounded like she had just woken up.</p>
<p>Then he heard Shen Yichong’s low voice come over the phone, “Don’t sleep with your head under the quilt.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was taken aback.</p>
<p>The couple was together!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao just woken up…</p>
<p>Chen Jiao didn’t dare to think about those things. He told himself it was all fake…</p>
<p>Right, they were only acting for their young son. They were just creating the illusion that his parents were still living happily together. They must have been acting for a long time since there clearly wasn’t any love between the husband and wife.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao finally heard Yu Yaoyao’s voice through his musings.</p>
<p>It sounded like Shen Yichong had woken her up. She even sounded a little upset. In a groggy, semi-conscious state she asked, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>Those simple words felt like a knife twisting into Chen Jiao’s chest.</p>
<p>But if he thought that was bad, the rest of Yu Yaoyao’s words were excruciating, “Role? Script?” It seemed she had only caught the last few words he’d said. “For work related matters, please contact my manager. I don’t accept work calls. Goodbye”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao said anxiously, “Wait, it’s me, Chen Jiao! Don’t hang up!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s sleep-fogged brain cleared immediately at his words. “Gangster Chen! What do you want?” Now that she was awake, she was fiercer than ever before.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao felt as if there was something wedged in his throat. He didn’t have the time or will-power to untangle the origin of ‘Gangster Chen’. Something told him it wasn’t a title to be proud of. “Xiao Yao, listen to me,” he begged, “I sincerely invite you to audition for this role. Please just ignore the bad blood between Shen Yichong and me, as well as the previous incidents that happened between us. Just look at the drama and the character from the perspective of an actress, okay?”</p>
<p>“No,” Yu Yaoyao refused without hesitation. “I don’t like the script. Oh, and not to mention that script isn’t even yours in the first place. Putting that aside, what makes you think you have any right to ask me to put all my grudges aside? You’re a thief!  A robber!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was confused, “Why do you not like it?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was too lazy to entertain him. She didn’t feel like explaining herself. “I told you I’m not interested. Just give up already!” She hung up.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was so angry. He wanted to call her back but managed to stop himself.</p>
<p>When he called Yu Yaoyao, Shen Yichong was with her. She must have turned the offer down because Shen Yichong intimidated her into it! After all, it was only with Shen Yichong’s consent that she could get her property worth 100 million Yuan after the divorce.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao became convinced that he had found the root of this problem. He had to deal with Shen Yichong first. Only by removing the biggest, most oppressive obstacle did he have any chance of getting close to Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>After waiting for the whole afternoon, he finally got the exact news Guo Li had bought from the secretary of the law firm. Then he gave Shen Yichong a call.</p>
<p>Now, on the phone to Shen Yichong, Chen Qia sounded proud. Such an occasion was very rare in this type of situation. “Two villas on Jiayu Road, four shop lots on Dahe Road, the vehicles… All of them are to be gifted to Yu Yaoyao after two years… Does that passage sound familiar to you, Mr. Shen?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao grabbed the cigarette box on the table, his expression curious.</p>
<p>“As husband and wife, you are putting on a show on the variety show. If everyone knows that the both of you are deceiving the public, do you think the share price of Guangxin would fall? Will Yu Yaoyao’s web drama be affected?” He plucked a cigarette out the box and skillfully lit it. “Don’t worry, I don’t want to expose you. I only want to suggest that Mr. Shen agrees to work with me to prevent future troubles. I don’t have many requirements; only two. First, stop interfering in my pursuit of Yaoyao. Let me come to your house to meet her; and give us a little room for privacy. If a reporter snaps a picture of you and I together, we can just say we have a deep, brotherly bond and I came to you to reminisce about the past. Secondly, don’t interfere with her decision. Even if I get ‘First Aid’, the role is suitable for her. I think you should put our personal grievances aside and let her star in it!” Chen Jiao was so confident after his speech that he even smiled.</p>
<p>He thought he had touched something fragile in Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, you’re a smart man…” he barely finished speaking before he was hit with such a verbal blow that it left him reeling.</p>
<p>“Chen Jiao, are you mentally ill?” Yu Yaoyao’s voice came over Shen Yichong’s phone.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was stunned!</p>
<p>Then it sounded like Shen Yichong took the phone back. “Actor Chen, you want me to make space for you to cultivate a relationship with my wife, in my house? My wife is right, you should go see a doctor. Get your illness seen as soon as possible. Don’t hurt others and yourself with all your delusions!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyes widened. “You… Don’t be stubborn about this! Aren’t you afraid people will find out the truth?”</p>
<p>“Darling, just ignore him. Come here,” Yu Yaoyao’s coquettish voice drifted from the phone.</p>
<p>And in the next moment, the call was dropped.</p></div>
