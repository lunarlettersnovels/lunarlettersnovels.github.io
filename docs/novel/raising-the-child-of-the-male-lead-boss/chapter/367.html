            <p><strong>Chapter 396</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>The last episode of ‘ifeMy Wife and I’ didn’t need any marketing. It went directly to the top of the real-time hot search on various online platforms. And soon, the number of clicks exceeded 100 million, far beyond that of the first episode!</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was smiling from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Most variety shows couldn’t escape the trend of getting high ratings in the first episode, stable ratings in the middle stage, and a gradual decline in the later stages.</p>
<p>However, the real-time back-end data that night showed that the number of new viewers in the last episode was almost equivalent to the number of new viewers accumulated in half a month.</p>
<p>New viewers even surged in on the second day after the show was broadcasted because of the previous episodes! And a large group of new fans was attracted at the end of the whole show.</p>
<p>On almost all official platforms audiences demanded a second season to be broadcasted.</p>
<p>On the second night, Yu Yaoyao herself was involved in two searches that got on the hot search rankings:</p>
<p>#Animal protection starts from me#</p>
<p>#Things you shouldn’t bring into your house, even if you’re rich#</p>
<p>The Wildlife Conservation Association reposted a short video of her declaration of not eating caviar or wearing a fur coat in ‘My Wife and I’. They even praised her by name.</p>
<p><em>[Thank you @YuYaoyao for setting an example in front of the camera. We should not overuse wild animals and misuse the products made from animal fur. She established a sense of social responsibility and maintained a good image of public welfare. It is everyone’s responsibility to love animals.]</em></p>
<p>This post got the fans excited again. It took four consecutive days before the heat subsided.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao also received an official invitation to serve as an image ambassador to promote the shooting of a short film on animal protection from the City’s Animal Protection Association. The short film was to be broadcasted on the city’s TV, Internet, and subways.</p>
<p>Ni Yi couldn’t help but laugh happily, while the marketing department of Guangxin felt very honored.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>After ‘My Wife and I’ ended, Yu Yaoyao would not participate in variety shows for a month, in accordance with the agreement with Zhao Yu.</p>
<p>But she wasn’t idle during this period either.</p>
<p>She continued the filming of the web drama and went for an introduction course for chefs, especially for the role.</p>
<p>A month later, the shooting of ‘Youth’ was completed. She then devoted herself to the script of the new movie while doing research and exercising, this included learning women’s boxing.</p>
<p>The following month, she joined the crew of ‘Killer’. Taking advantage of the muscles and abs she had got from her insane training, she strongly urged Director Liang to shoot all the action scenes at once.</p>
<p>She even when so far as to tan herself more. Even though a layer of skin from her waist and thighs peeled off due to burning, she didn’t complain. She just gritted her teeth and did her part. After all, it was a play she chose. She had to finish it no matter how hard it was.</p>
<p>Better a little loss now than plenty of sorrow later.</p>
<p>During this period, she also had an additional activity every night; crying to Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>She usually never expressed her tiredness or complained after a day of filming, but recently she began to share her bitterness with Shen Yichong. And when she was feeling very sad, she cried a few tears.</p>
<p>“The director was mean to me. I am in pain and tired. I was beaten on the sponge mat, and the director still wanted me to complete a two and a half rotation in midair… I don’t want to talk to him anymore. Darling, I’m in pain. Everything hurts. From now on, I will not do anymore fighting scenes. Never again!” she sobbed in his arms.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong always wrapped her in a quilt and patted her back to comfort her. He also personally massaged her aching arms, disinfected the scratched area, and coaxed her to sleep.</p>
<p>He originally wanted her to take some medicine, but she strongly refused. She claimed that the medicine was disgusting and bitter. And she also refused to get a shot. Shen Yichong could do nothing in the end and had no choice but to give up.</p>
<p>The filming took almost two weeks to complete because she was unfamiliar with some of the new settings. And within the two weeks, Yu Yaoyao seemed to have cried all the tears she had been holding back.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why she was suddenly so sensitive and vulnerable. Without thinking too much about it, she would roll into Shen Yichong’s arms every night and cry about her day. Then she would fall asleep and rest until the next morning.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong started to feel that something was wrong. He became a little more mindful. He followed her to the crew and became more cautious when it came to her meals. He spoke to Director Liang and was relieved when he found out that there would be no more fighting scenes in the future.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao’s attitude carried on for another two weeks, Shen Yichong finally started figuring things out. And when she frowned and pushed her lunch from the crew aside, his eyes practically shone.</p>
<p>“Did you miss your period this month?” Shen Yichong asked as he clasped his hands tightly together. If one looked closely enough, it was obvious that they were shaking.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao frowned then pressed her red lips tightly together. She pushed the lunch box in front of him unhappily.</p>
<p>What period was he talking about!</p>
<p>“Darling, I think this fish is rotten. It smells so awful…” Before she finished speaking, she covered her nose and mouth with her hand.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face turned pale for a moment. In a shaking voice he said, “Chen… Chen Lin, go get the car! Now!”</p>
