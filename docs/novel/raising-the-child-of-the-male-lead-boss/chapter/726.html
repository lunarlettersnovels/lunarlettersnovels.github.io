            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 25 – First Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Ni Yi came to pick her up early on the morning of the first shoot.</p>
<p>“Sister, are you prepared?!” He wasted no time to ask.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao yawned and chose her favorite golden high heels from the shoe rack and paired it with a matching mustard-colored scarf. This was the same color of the scales in her family she once envied.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s nothing.” She tightened the black coat around her and placed a loose, curly hair lock behind her ear.</p>
<p>Because she needs to have her makeup only on-site, her face was currently plain. But this small, porcelain face was as beautiful as ever. The pure natural pink color of her lips was not too tacky, and her tender cheeks had a mild blush from the heat of the room.</p>
<p>Ni Yi took a look and felt that she kept looking more attractive day by day than when he first saw her a few days ago. He didn’t know what she did to bloom this much!</p>
<p>It is certainly impossible for one to say that she stayed up late to read the script and recite her lines. This face, at first glance, is full of proper sleep, as if it was packed with collagen.</p>
<p>Ni Yi thought about it and sighed, stuffing the thermos handed by Mama Xu into his bag, and lifted his hand to wipe the sweat on his forehead.</p>
<p>“Sister, at least recite two lines this time.” He added. “As this is your first play in a long while, I’m going to remind you not to forget: Don’t read ‘1234’ again, otherwise the netizens will roast you.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, holding the little bun’s hand, just happened to come down the stairs. The little bun frowned at hearing this and looked at his mommy with little eyes that were filled with worry.</p>
<p><i>Mommy is going to be roasted! She is going to read ‘chicken legs’ this time.</i></p>
<p>“Dad, Mommy is going to be roasted …” The little bun walked far away, out of earshot, and then gently pulled at his father’s cuffs. With anxious eyes, he asked, “Can you help her?”</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong’s lips were tight.</p>
<p>The little bun only received his father’s silent reply, and after a long while, hung his head in frustration.</p>
<p>“Dad, I’ll go to kindergarten.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Inside the car, Ni Yi, with the temperament of a nagging mother, wiped the sweat on his forehead and chattered simultaneously.</p>
<p>“When you are on-site, you should always listen to what the director says. This time the male and female lead are Guang Xin’s own people—you can ask them any questions.” He started. “The female lead is Meng Xinran, who has starred in two films by Director Li Bo. He is quite fond of her.”</p>
<p>The company helped cast her in a variety show. After a while, she was cast as the empress, and is your good sister in the play, and also your rival. She’s also recognized for her good temper and is very polite to her seniors.</p>
<p>“The male lead, Wei Ming, is a very experienced old actor. Legend has it that he particularly likes to point out the performance of newcomers. He is family-oriented and a warm person. Sister, you can take the opportunity to learn from him. He plays the emperor’s rival in the play.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi did a lot of homework, and he obviously studied the script faithfully from beginning to end.</p>
<p>But when he finished, he only saw Yu Yaoyao slouching at the back seat without a care in the world, and felt the sweat on his forehead flow down again.</p>
<p>“Sister, I am begging you—let’s give a good performance this time. Director Li Bo didn’t have a good impression on you before, and now you came back five years later …”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao rolled over lazily. “I know he hated me before. I wish I could get a lunch box on the first day this time.”</p>
<p>This was written in the novel, too.</p>
<p>Ni Yi sighed. “Sister, I hope you really do understand … Get up and read the script, and don’t be scolded by Director Li again.”</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao’s legs only felt awkward and the high-heeled shoes were squeezing her feet. “I really don’t understand how humans like such uncomfortable footwear!”</p>
<p>“Sister, you … Okay, let me read the script and you listen! Make sure to listen!”</p>
