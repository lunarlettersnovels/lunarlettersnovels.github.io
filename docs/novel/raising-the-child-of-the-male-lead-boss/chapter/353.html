            <p><strong>Chapter 410</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>The news was still on the hot search after a whole night.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t the ‘defeat’ that Chen Cheng had imagined. Instead, it was a ‘counterattack’!</p>
<p>After Shen Yichong promised that he would invest in the kitten-and-writer movie, Yu Yaoyao finally went to sleep. When she was asleep, he immediately contacted Ren Siqi’s husband, Da Fu, and asked him for the plan for the entire movie, as well as a follow-up with the progress.</p>
<p>They were on the phone for an hour discussing the project.</p>
<p>After the call, it was almost midnight.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until then that he discovered what had happened on Weibo. He also received an invitation from ‘Pan Xiaobaihua’, to leave a message.</p>
<p>‘Pan Xiaobaihua’ was very anxious. She invited him to show up and write on behalf of them. She also mentioned that she would wait until nine o’clock the next morning for him, then she would write the passage herself if he hadn’t posted anything.</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth rose a little when he saw this.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao usually woke up at 8 o’clock. After she washed her face, brushed her teeth, and had her breakfast, 9 o’clock was about the time she surfed the Internet.</p>
<p>‘Pan Xiaobaihua’ obviously didn’t want Yu Yaoyao to see the hot search, as the situation had not been dealt with.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked over the evidence collected and sent by ‘Pan Xiaobaihua’. He realized that this person not only had a set of rules when doing things, she was also quite capable, logical, and organized.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a screenshot and sent it to Chen Lin. “Get in touch with ‘Pan Xiaobaihua’ and see if you can invite her to be a manager of the fans for Guangxin.”</p>
<p>He hung up the phone after giving the order. After looking at the information collected, he took out his notebook, ready to draft the passage.</p>
<p>As he was about leave the bedroom, he heard a soft cry. “Darling, I thought you went to pee, why haven’t you come back yet?” Yu Yaoyao was half-awake. When she turned over and touched the empty side of the bed, wanting to ask for a hug, she realized Shen Yichong wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. He put down his notebook and went back to the bed. After turning off the lights, he pulled Yu Yaoyao into his arms and went to sleep.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chen Cheng, the marketing team, and the writers of the hot search, stayed on Weibo the whole night. They found that there were no major obstacles, and everything was going smoothly. Even Shen Yichong’s subsidiary account hadn’t appeared. They were ecstatic!</p>
<p>Even though they all had dark circles under their sleep deprived, red eyes, and they couldn’t stop yawning, they were filled with excitement.</p>
<p>“I think we found Guangxin’s weak spot this time! The pictures of Yu Yaoyao were the best evidence. No matter how smart Mr. Shen is, there is no way he can turn this around now.”</p>
<p>“Right. Yu Yaoyao will be cancelled soon. The public is definitely going to question her next two movies.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Even if ‘Allure’ is not highly rated, at least the actors’ reputation will be established.”</p>
<p>The people in Wansheng were having coffee and discussing their achievements. But as they started discussing the next step, their phones started vibrating wildly.</p>
<p>When they pulled the devices out and looked down at the screens, they were all dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng even spat out his mouthful of coffee.</p>
<p><em>[Shen Yichong v: Announcing good news. Our second baby will be meeting all of you in four months. Thank you all for the love and support you have given my wife.]</em></p>
<p>Chen Cheng almost bit his tongue right off. “She’s pregnant… Pregnant!?”</p>
<p>In four months… Didn’t that mean Yu Yaoyao had been pregnant or five or six months already?</p>
<p>His expression darkened. “Wait, when was the crew photo we released taken?”</p>
<p>Without needing to check, the head of the Wansheng marketing department’s face fell in defeat. “It was during her pregnancy period. Which was two months ago.”</p>
<p>“Sh-” Chen Cheng couldn’t help but cursed and slam the door. “Didn’t people say Shen Yichong was infertile… Damn!”</p>
<p>He lost. He lost again!</p>
<p>This was just another fiasco!</p>
<p>He went back to the office to check the comments. As expected, the atmosphere of the whole comment section had changed.</p>
<p><em>[Gosh! Does that mean she did the filming while knowing she was pregnant? It makes sense that she’s lying down while talking to the director! I think she was trying to make sure her pregnancy was stable!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Isn’t she so professional? I didn’t want to go to work when I was pregnant with my second child because my back was so unbearably sore. Thinking back, all I had to do was sit in my office, while she had to do fighting scenes…]</em></p>
<p><em>[Du Jingya, a 20-year-old girl, comparing herself to a pregnant mother on the matter of who arrived at the crew earliest… Seriously? Sigh!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yesterday I was ready to be a fan of Miss Du, thinking that she’s beautiful, hardworking, and professional, but she was trying to build her success while bringing down a pregnant woman? This kind of personality… Goodbye.]</em></p>
<p>Chen Cheng could have vomited blood.</p>
<p>And the YY fans who were quiet yesterday all came out in full force now.</p>
<p>Now that they had confirmed the existence of the second baby, they were all excited but had nowhere to showcase their happiness. Given the situation, they all vented on Du Jingya’s hot search:</p>
<p><em>[Our Yaoyao has never done anything bad, but some people are always trying to bring her down!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Our second baby is so strong, just like our sister! This is what you call hardworking, okay? Du Jingya? I don’t even know her. Please don’t use our sister to make yourself famous!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’m totally speechless! Our sister was four months pregnant two months ago? She must have lay down because she felt so unwell after the filming. Her assistant and manager were there to take care of her, and the director came over to talk to her… What is wrong with this?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I don’t even want to say anything here. Anyone who has experienced pregnancy knows how often the mother-to-be gets back ache and feels hungry!]</em></p>
<p>Chen Cheng couldn’t read the comments any longer.</p>
<p>The comments section, originally filled with praise for Du Jingya, was quickly being overtaken by YY fans.</p>
<p>The increase in popularity of the post caused more passers-by to click in, and everyone chose to side with the weak… the pregnant woman.</p>
<p>The entire drastically situation changed.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng pressed his temples. Just as he was about to go rest, a message popped up.</p>
<p>#My wife is doing pretty good lately: For the voices attacking my wife’s acting skill, I am refuting it, @Wanshengmedia, @DuJingya#</p>
<p>A sudden chill chased all the way down Chen Cheng’s spine.</p>
