            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 158 – Charming Woman (2)</strong></p>
<p>Soon, Liu Yazhi could not help but look at Yu Yaoyao who charmingly sat at the chair in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>“We should try a new outfit on her,” said the director. “Prepare the other set of costumes.” He added, looking at the stylists.</p>
<p>“Even makeup has been used since the ancient times. This makeup style is suitable for the outfit hanging over there,” Liu Yazhi said as she could not wait to see her in different get-ups.</p>
<p>Thus, Yu Yaoyao, who had only a minor supporting role, was showered with such attention by the director and the screenwriter that she’d changed her makeup and costumes four times already. The makeup and photoshoot took them about one and a half hours before announcing the success of it.</p>
<p>Soon, before Yu Yaoyao could leave, Liu Yazhi swept away her pride and personally asked for Yu Yaoyao’s WeChat account, and even followed her on Weibo.</p>
<p>“If you have any questions about the characters in the drama, you can ask me anytime.”</p>
<p>Zhou Lin looked at Liu Yazhi and smiled directly. “This is the first time I’ve seen you being so kind to a female artist.”</p>
<p>Liu Yazhi snorted. “No, I am not kind.”</p>
<p>Despite talking to Zhou Lin, she couldn’t help but follow Yu Yaoyao and take a few photos of her with her phone. After appreciating her several times, she decided to set her picture as her phone’s wallpaper.</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who followed Yu Yaoyao throughout the day, had fallen head over heels with her. He had seen everything, from the hatred of the screenwriter up to her sudden change of attitude and all in a span of a few short hours. Moreover, at the end of the day, she clearly favored Yu Yaoyao much more than the female protagonist.</p>
<p>In addition, of course, he did not forget the boss’s order. He quietly asked permission from the director and after taking two photos privately, he sent them to Shen Yichong.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>At this moment, the atmosphere in Guangxin Entertainment’s conference room was a little serious.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was sitting at the head of the table; eyes were cold, body radiating pressure. The shareholders of the company looked at each other but no one dared say a word. Nevertheless, the head of the investment department, Xu Hong had decided to speak. Xu Hong was a senior investment director who’d moved to Guangxin Entertainment from a competitor entertainment three years ago.</p>
<p>He pushed his gold-framed glasses on his nose, held the laser pointer in his hand, and opened his mouth daringly.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, we have conducted a market research on ‘Allure’, an oriental fantasy themed novel that is quite popular among readers on the internet nowadays. It’s still leading the sales ranking. This month, due to being advertised, the results even squeezed into the hole, garnering itself a spot in the top 10. In a survey of 3,000 readers, 70% of them are looking forward to the movie adaptation, while 23% are worried that the movie will not follow the entire novel plot. Meanwhile, the remnant said that they will just wait for people’s reviews before deciding to watch it in the cinemas.</p>
<p>“Moreover, the director is Qiao Anni, who is extremely good at big-budget movies. All of his five works in the past have been very successful and even earned a nomination for the best film. The public recognizes Director Joanne’s aesthetic and talent, and are willing to spend for his work.</p>
<p>“The investment department advises to invest. Not only Guangxin Entertainment can completely open up in the movie market, but also cooperate with Director Qiao Anni in many aspects in the future,” Xu Hong said, while using a laser pointer to point out several important data.</p>
<p>“The heroine who will be appearing this time is the artist who won the best actress at the latest award ceremony. As of the moment, our investment looks absolutely positive and the risk is very low.”</p>
<p>Many nodded in approval of what Xu Hong had presented. However, Shen Yichong, who looked more serious this time, looked up at the data shown on the screen and threw out a question.</p>
<p>“Have you read the original books of the movie adaptations he directed?”</p>
<p>Xu Hong was shocked. “I’ve studied the script.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong slapped the table. “Have you seen his previous movies?”</p>
<p>Xu Hong was very confident this time. “I have. Director Qiao Anni is currently the best at large…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong directly interrupted him. “Then you should know that, first, he has never filmed a movie with special effects; second, he has his own unique interpretation and characteristics of the story as well as screenplay.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“You haven’t read the original book, so I’ll tell you this.” Shen Yichong’s voice was deep and low, “The script is very different from the original. I have spent a week reading and re-reading it. I have studied the adapted script and come to a conclusion-”</p>
<p>“The adaptation is a failure!” His voice was cold, and his words hit them in the face.</p>
<p>“It is not terrible to adapt film and television dramas whose plot is not the same as the original. The terrible thing is that it is not only separated from the original work but also contradicts the original storyline. Even the rules set for movie adaptations are violated and completely ruined.”</p>
<p>“Did anyone in the investment department even read the book? Do I have to spoon-feed you with everything? Everyone should think and do the necessary work before presenting a project!”</p>
<p>Xu Hong suddenly felt his boss’ coldness and a cold sweat flowed from his forehead.</p>
<p>“Some people read…” He spoke but was immediately cut off by Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“In addition,” Shen Yichong, who was suddenly distracted by his vibrating phone, picked it up and his lips twitched. “I watched the preliminary preparations of the film and even the set’s makeup photoshoot; all of it is far from the passing standard I have set. Withdraw.”</p>
<p>Some of the shareholders disagreed with him.</p>
<p>“The first batch of money has been invested in the adaptation, if we withdraw right now, the public will definitely say something against us, thinking that we are short of funds. This will greatly affect the company’s stocks.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong slid the screen of his phone and gave him a cold look. “If you don’t withdraw the money right now, 80 million yuan will be wasted. Do you think our stock prices will still rise?”</p>
<p>Being stared coldly by the boss left him tongue-tied and trembling in trepidation.</p>
<p>“Well then, let’s vote!”</p>
<p>Chen Lin, who made the minutes of the meeting, stood up and organized the voting.</p>
<p>“All those in favour of withdrawing, raise hands,” he said.</p>
<p>However, his boss who slowly moved his hands distracted him. Taking a closer look, it revealed that the boss was busy looking at his phone’s screen and smiled slightly.</p>
<p>Everyone stared at him as his coldness seemed to have thawed, like a glacier melting due to global warming. Moreover, despite being stared at, Shen Yichong was still busy fiddling with his phone’s screen, like a chess player who was engrossed in his game.</p>
