<p><strong>Chapter 482</strong></p>
<p>Looking up at the video again, Fang Qiuye was hiding in the corner of the living room. She covered her mouth, as if she was secretly making a phone call.</p>
<p>“Please send help! Teacher Gong!” she whispered with a desperate tone in her voice. “Are you watching the live broadcast? Can you translate for me, please? I’ll treat you to every meal you requested! Also, do you need someone who could help you do housework?! You can ask for anything!”</p>
<p>Gong Xuechang: “…”</p>
<p>He was a doctoral student in the English department and is a senior lecturer at the university, and he may soon undergo a new round of ratings and be promoted to the level of associate professor.</p>
<p>But now… he had to translate a romance novel?!</p>
<p>“Sorry, I had a lot of R-18 thoughts in my head when I wrote the first chapter!” she continued. Fang Qiuye was going to repent! “But I promise, I got normal again from the second chapter onwards! Teacher Gong, please!”</p>
<p>Gong Xuechang: “…Okay.”</p>
<p>When he saw the girl who was about to cry in the video, he agreed. Sure enough, this was her novel. Gong Xuechang’s eyelids jumped again as he looked at the title.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye, on the other hand, quickly wore her Bluetooth earpiece while listening to her improvised lecture. Occasionally, she was corrected by Teacher Gong for her inaccurate pronunciation.</p>
<p>“Since you are on TV, you must be serious. You must not mislead the viewers and children.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was shocked and immediately sat upright. “Okay, teacher!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was reading sentence by sentence. “Huh? Big Head?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye: “…”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Director Zhao next to them was already having a headache.</p>
<p>An episode about a fan meeting her idol and studying hard had turned into a session of reading romance novels. He wondered if this could be broadcasted… If it was then, he would be advertising the author. Should he go collect the fee?</p>
<p>But even if he chose not to broadcast it, they were already advertising for the author. In the common section, many people mentioned they had started following the author and read the first chapter… Director Zhao got a headache just looking at this.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was really good at selling stuff, especially in the female market. But he didn’t expect that she would even do that well when it came to novels.</p>
<p>The fans in the live broadcast room were obviously very excited.</p>
<p><em>[I read the same novel with my idol. Looks like we have the same taste. Yeah!]</em></p>
<p><em>[May I know if YYY is Yaoyao herself?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I also like to read novels, can I recommend a book list to Yaoyao through private message?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao is really serious about reading novels! Even after giving birth to a baby, she still remembers the plot of this book!]</em></p>
<p>While Director Zhao was having a headache due to the situation, Shen Yichong wasn’t feeling any better either. What Shen Yichong was most worried about before had obviously happened. Although ‘Big Head.’.. Fang Qiuye didn’t reveal her identity, she was also reading the main story with Yu Yaoyao to the audience. They bet they couldn’t find another female artist like this in the entire market! Fortunately, he noticed something was wrong beforehand and had asked his son to go somewhere else.</p>
<p>“Little Sweetheart is crying.” Shen Yichong couldn’t hold back. He finally stepped forward to stop the ladies. “Do you want to go take a look at her?”</p>
<p>Little Sweetheart was one of Yu Yaoyao’s most precious treasures right now. The slightest disturbance could make her nervous. Along with Little Bun, she would carefully record how much milk Little Sweetheart drank every day.</p>
<p>“Huh? She’s crying?” Yu Yaoyao suddenly stopped reading the R-18 story. “I’ll go take a look.”</p>
<p>She stood up on the spot. Shen Yichong could immediately breathe a sigh of relief. “Yeah, okay. I’ll entertain the guests.”</p>
<p>He should keep Fang Qiuye here so there was a safe distance between her and his wife and daughter. Those kinds of novels she wrote were poisonous! His wife was fine, since she was already married to a CEO like him.</p>
<p>But his daughter was still young. Should there be bias for her choice in men in the future, the problem would be big. He was firm that his daughter must not see the stories written by Fang Qiuye. If she insisted, he would only let her read them when she grew older. Shen Yichong was quickly able to make up his mind.</p>
<p>But as soon as he finished speaking, Yu Yaoyao hugged his waist.  “Darling, can I let Big Head see our Little Sweetheart?” she said. “Big Head is my number one fan. On the internet, she has always said that she wants to see Little Sweetheart. Can we let Big Head take a look at her without the cameraman following us in?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face twitched suddenly.</p>
<p>The comment section in the live broadcast room exploded.</p>
<p><em>[Little Sweetheart who has never appeared on the camera!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I don’t think any pictures of hers are even posted publicly?!]</em></p>
<p><em>[President, what kind of luck are you on!?]</em></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye also felt that she was hit on the head by the grand prize, and she was a little dizzy.</p>
