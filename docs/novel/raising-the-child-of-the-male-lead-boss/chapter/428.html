            <p><strong>Chapter 335 -Another Chance (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Chen Jiao took a deep breath, “Ling Shuang,” he called her by her full name, “take a good look at yourself. Look at what people are saying about you on and offline, and look at what’s happening behind closed doors. When you called me yesterday you didn’t tell me that you threw a child’s origami heart on the floor and stepped on it. People saw this behavior,” as he spoke, there as a trace of alienation in his voice that hadn’t been there before.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang suddenly panicked. She wasn’t on Shen Yichong’s level yet. She relied on Chen Jiao to set up various things for her. Although she was confident that she would not lose to Yu Yaoyao, regardless of appearance or acting skills, she wasn’t very deep in the entertainment industry yet.</p>
<p>“Brother, I was wrong. I will reflect on myself! I was so angry that everyone on the Internet was praising Yu Yichong’s comments. I lost my temper, but I didn’t mean to vent my anger on the child. Let me clarify, I… ”</p>
<p>“I will let Public Relations decide how to deal with this matter. To clarify, you still have to personally apologize, and you will wait for my notice. I will not be able to recover the magazine shoot, but we still strive for the role in the film as much as possible. If that fails, you will temporarily retreat to behind the scenes.”</p>
<p>The phone clicked and hung up.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s face held an ugly expression. Apologize? She’d just been in a bad mood! Now she had to apologize as well? She hadn’t even hit the child!</p>
<p>She clenched her fists. She couldn’t lose her role as the supporting character in the movie! Otherwise, she’d have lost everything. Go behind the scenes? How was she supposed to attract Shen Yichong’s attention!</p>
<p>She bent her head and glanced at the topic that had risen to the eighth most popular search. Her face became even paler than before when she read the comments:</p>
<p><em>[What rubbish! Leave the entertainment industry, okay?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I don’t want to be a keyboard warrior, but if the teacher scandal is true, as a mother, I really can’t handle this!! She wants to experience being a teacher? Please leave the nursery school!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is that nursery school crazy? Do they really let actors be teachers? Do they think children are guinea pigs?!!]</em></p>
<p><em>[The Education Bureau should deal with this! Don’t they require a teaching certificate? There are so many monsters among those that teach children! How can you be certain your child is in a good environment!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Nothing to say! Blocked!]</em></p>
<p><em>[@CommunistYouthLeague @Zi Guangge Come and see, do you care about these scumbags?]</em></p>
<p>The more she read, the uglier her expression became. She hurriedly picked up her phone and called Chen Jiao again.</p>
<p>No one answered!</p>
<p>By now she was completely panicked.</p>
<p>She hurriedly opened WeChat and sent him voice message after voice message:</p>
<p>“Brother, don’t ignore me. Please, brother, save me again this time. I really didn’t mean it!”</p>
<p>“You told me you have no brothers or sister or parents. Only I can encourage and comfort you! Brother, I need you to help me now, don’t leave me alone! This time it’s my fault!</p>
<p>“Tell the principal that this was a misunderstanding, and that Teacher He didn’t see it with her own eyes, and what she wrote on Weibo isn’t true!</p>
<p>I will pay her. I will pay her if she deletes the Weibo post. It’s all a misunderstanding, okay…”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang finally knew what it felt like to be afraid. Being a star was much harder than she thought. Every move a star made was so easily exposed to the public. Just because she hadn’t been able to control her temper and inherent arrogance she was now burdened with tremendous infamy.</p>
<p>“Give me another chance and I will do it properly!” Ling Shuang begged bitterly.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao finally sent a simple “okay” and she was relieved. She melted onto the sofa covered in cold sweat.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>On the day of the magazine photoshoot Yu Yaoyao followed Ni Yi’s car to the set. She also took the Little Bun, Shen Rui with her. The kindergarten was already on vacation, and many children had gone home. Shen Rui was usually taken care of by a nanny at home, but the recent child abuse incident by Ling Shuang made Yu Yaoyao vigilant.</p>
<p>She was afraid of leaving the child at home. Because of the tragic ending from the nanny’s negligence in the story, she had resolutely asked Shen Yichong if she could bring Shen Rui with her. This way she could be certain he was alright.</p>
<p>“How has that girl been?” Yu Yaoyao had been holding the question in. She hadn’t checked Weibo and only asked her close friend Little Sisi and Ni Yi about the gossip.</p>
<p>Ni Yi gave a helpless smile and said, “Chen Jiao’s studio came out to clarify for her. It was a misunderstanding. Apparently, she accidentally stepped on the child’s origami. This morning, he personally accompanied her to the little girl’s house to apologize and appease her. In addition, she also apologized to the public. As an actor, she wanted to get as close to the role as possible, but she did not consider her actions properly. Now, Ling Shuang is preparing for the nursery school teacher certification and will leave the nursery school before then. She also came forward to publicly cry and apologize. She claimed that she has reflected deeply on herself and her actions. But she really cares and loves her children and refutes the previous accusations of child abuse.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao listened and said suddenly, “It’s not easy for Brother Chen Jiao.”</p>
<p>It was obvious that he was trying hard to preserve Ling Shuang’s public image.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Ni Yi nodded, looking at Shen Rui who was in the car watching an online elementary school class on his tablet. She lowered her voice and continued, “The teacher who posted the first post exposing Ling Shuang also deleted her Weibo. She also said that she had only listened to the children in class and questioned Ling Shuang without investigating clearly. Then she apologized.”</p>
<p>There was some type of reconciliation between the two parties. The teacher must have received an envelope stuffed with cash. Chen Jiao must have really used a lot of contacts and money this time.</p>
