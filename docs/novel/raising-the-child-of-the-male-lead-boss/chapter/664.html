            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 87 – STEAMY</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao buried her nose on the sofa and happily dozed off. But soon, a tall shadow obscured the lights from the ceiling that landed on her face. The faint smell of tobacco, mixed with a hint of clean grass after rain, poured into the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>When she looked up, she saw Shen Yichong and his usual poker face, holding the steamed bun Shen Rui in his arms. He stood in front of the sofa wearing his ordinary, stripped, gray clothes for  everyday.</p>
<p>“The bathtub is ready.” Shen Yichong spoke in a clipped tone, his eyebrows threatening to knot at the middle. “Get up.”</p>
<p>The little steamed bun in his arms raised his head, ready to launch a complaint, but he was speedily interrupted by Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Although your mother’s hand is hurt, her feet were not broken. If she doesn’t walk, she’ll become fat. And then she will cry.”</p>
<p>The little steamed bun listened solemnly. He was only mute, also recognizing the truth to his father’s words.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao too, also wanted to get up and walk on her own, but when she heard Shen Yichong’s words, she could not help but hum. Her slanted eyes flashed, and she stood up, twisting her slender waist to rest the weight of her whole body on his back. The two soft masses in front of her chest were then tantalizingly pressed on his rigid spine!</p>
<p>“Husband~”</p>
<p>Two slender, delicate arms draped on his shoulders from behind. Red lips lifted slightly towards his earlobe, before she gently blew her warm breath into his ear. “My feet can’t move. If you sit cross-legged for too long, legs can become so sore and numb.”</p>
<p>With her arm hooked to his taller frame, the sleeves of her white dress naturally dragged down the length of her arm, revealing the skin underneath—fair, smooth and fragile as if one blow could break it.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s back suddenly stiffened like stone.</p>
<p>As she spoke, the fragrance from her hot mouth swirled around him like a sweet mist, surrounding him from all sides. It made his throat tighten in reflex. As if it wasn’t enough, her tender, slightly warm fingertips brushed his neck, even accidentally touching his jaw. With everything combined, his brain couldn’t help but conjure steamy images not suitable for children.</p>
<p>But soon his deep eyes flashed cold and sober. He avoided her gauze-wrapped hand, and squeezed her arm almost wrapped around his Adam’s apple with his free hand. Adding a bit of strength into it as he did so.</p>
<p>His eyes were hard as steel.</p>
<p>“Get off. Go by yourself.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui wanted to talk, but he was quickly carried away by his father. His soft voices of protest soon dissipated as they went further away into the hall.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao snorted, “A hypocrite man!” He obviously has feelings for her!</p>
<p><em>Let’s see how long he can endure!</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao went to the second floor. As soon as she entered the room, she saw Shen Yichong discussing the kindergarten lesson for today with his son–He did not even spare her a look. Meanwhile, the steamed bun was only pouting unhappily while listening.</p>
<p>Finally, under the unending protests of his son, Shen Yichong stood up and opened the bathroom door.</p>
<p>This master bedroom had a massive bathroom. In addition to the jacuzzi that was already filled with water, there was a shower, two wash basins, a sandalwood shelf for stacking towels, and a special wardrobe for changing into pajamas and daily apparel.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong waited for her to come in, his face dark like a storm. He pulled the bathroom screen in front of the shower towards the bathtub and closed the bathroom door, cutting off the steamed bun’s line of sight from outside.</p>
<p>He leaned against the wall of the bathroom, crossing his arms.</p>
<p>“Wash,” he only uttered one word.</p>
<p>From his angle, the screen blocked him from seeing Yaoyao washing.</p>
<p>“Hurry up, I have a conference call in half an hour.” Shen Yichong glared at her to make her move. He added, “If there is anything you need, call me.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gave a coquettish welp. And before she could reach the hidden screen, she was already barefoot and unbuttoning her clothes as she walked all the way. The dress she was wearing today was like a onesie, from the neckline towards the skirt below was only a row of buttons.</p>
<p>With her fingers fast, it was not long before she had unbuttoned towards her waist.</p>
<p>The soft, plump peaks, immediately sprung as if they were released from captivity. Her exposed fair skin was a harsh contrast to the rows of black buttons. Even more, her black lacy bra perfectly outlined the gorgeous curves she was proud off.</p>
<p>Pure black and satin white in sharp contrast lined her figure in detail under the hazy lighting.</p>
<p>The upper portion of her dress was quickly pushed below her waist, hanging loosely on her thighs as they were held up desperately by the last few buttons on her small waist. Bare and tiny feet stepped on the black, gold-lined tiles. She was like a fluttering butterfly falling into the darkness…no, a witch on the ready to devour him!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong who was standing at the corner, suddenly fixed her with a deep look.</p>
