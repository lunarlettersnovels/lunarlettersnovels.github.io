<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 283 – Persistent (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Ling Shuang barely ate anything for lunch. The information of Shen Yichong’s lunch meeting with Director Ma was discovered by Chen Jiao via the Director’s assistant. She had been elated at the news and had spent three hours in the morning getting ready. She had even gone as far to hire a make-up artist. She wanted to leave a good impression, even if it would be a fleeting meet up.</p>
<p>She and Chen Jiao had made sure to bump into Director Ma at the specified time at the hotel to make it seem like an ordinary coincidence. All her efforts had gone to waste. Shen Yichong wasn’t coming. Ling Shuang had no appetite. She took a few bites of the bread and nibbled on some salad before putting down her knife and fork in disappointment.</p>
<p>She thought of Yu Yaoyao attending the audition side by side with Shen Yichong. It made the food in her mouth taste like cardboard. Her chest felt tight and she couldn’t think about eating at all. She felt nauseous. <em>Did she even know anything about auditions? Has she even bothered to skim the script? Why the hell does she get to stand beside him? </em>Ling Shuang cursed inwardly.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang wiped at her mouth with the napkin. Chen Jiao cut her a strip of beef. “Eat a little more,” he said, making sure no one heard them. “Maybe you will be the last few contestants in line. I’ll come with you—”</p>
<p>“No!” exclaimed Ling Shuang, before composing herself and whispering, “Brother, there is already bad blood between you and Shen. It’s better for me to go alone. It’s just an audition, I can handle it. Just make sure you are ready to celebrate after the good news.” She smiled weakly to placate him. “Besides, I want people to see my talent and skill, which they surely will. I want to do this role, whether he is there or not.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao frowned, but he nodded, agreeing with her. When they finished the food, they bid goodbye to Director Ma and left for the audition. Chen Jiao drove her till the gate of the venue and left.</p>
<p>The audition was at two o’clock. She had still more than thirty minutes at her disposal. She headed to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. She gritted her teeth and reminded herself that she was better than Yu Yaoyao. She recited the lines of the script for the last time and prepared herself for the audition.</p>
<p>She had been preparing for this role for almost two months now. She had practiced the script diligently every single day. She had put so much effort on researching for the lead role. She <em>must</em> get this role! She had worked hard for it.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang splashed her face with cold water and touched up her makeup. She took a deep breath and made her way towards the audition room. She heard soft laughter coming from the audition room.</p>
<p>“Honey, is this the role that you discouraged me to take because it was youthful?” said a delicate voice, “The plot looks very interesting.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes,” the man said, “I thought you should concentrate on other kinds of roles first.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s heart skipped a beat when she heard Shen Yichong’s voice. She felt overjoyed that he had prevented Yu Yaoyao from taking this role. If he didn’t want her playing the ‘youthful’ role, it could only mean that Shen Yichong thought Yu Yaoyao was old to play the character. Ling Shuang’s disappointment from the lunch hour disappeared. She felt euphoric. <em>Ha! He thinks she is old to play a young role like this one, </em>thought Ling Shuang happily. <em>Obviously a mother to a child, and a woman married for five years like her, could never dream to pull off a role like this!</em></p>
<p>She continued to the room with a spring in her steps. She saw Director Ma greeting the couple at the door. She approached them and bowed respectfully. “Director, President Shen,” she said, “I am honored to meet both of you.”</p>
<p>She raised her head and looked at Shen Yichong. Her heart momentarily stopped. <em>Mr. Shen…</em>. She went to film school and worked hard even on small roles to be acknowledged for her talent. She had hoped that she could become somebody successful one day so that he would notice her. He was a legend in the entertainment industry. Mr. Shen had transformed an ordinary boy like Chen Jiao into a successful man. She had fallen in love with him. From a distance, he had appeared like he always did: cold, indifferent and aloof. She wanted to catch his eye. He was the only one she idolized, the only one for her. Only him.</p>
