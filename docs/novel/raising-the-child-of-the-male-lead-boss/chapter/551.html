            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 209 – A Heartwarming Dinner (1)</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong watched as she gingerly scrambled the eggs on the stove, in the end, he reached out to wrap his fingers around the little hand, demonstrating the corrector method to stir fry. Since he was much taller than Yu Yaoyao, he was able to walk behind her and hold her hand as he guided her.</p>
<p>From the camera’s perspective, it seemed as though he was hugging her from behind, enveloping her petite stature with his tall form.</p>
<p>“Now, put the seasoning. Sprinkle some salt. Continue to stir fry the leeks and the eggs together.”</p>
<p>As instructed, his voice had become inexplicably gentle.</p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu, who was next to them, smiled like an elderly watching over a newlywed couple.</p>
<p>Behind them, Shen Rui, perched on a children’s stool to wash the apples properly, silently watched his parents hug each other. He couldn’t help but pout and puff his cheeks like a hamster. His parents were immersed in their own world and had totally forgotten about him!</p>
<p>But when he glanced at the apples he was diligently washing, and then at the seemingly insurmountable height of the kitchen counter, he clenched his fists.</p>
<p>He had to eat well so he can grow faster. Otherwise, Mommy could only be hugged from behind by Dad …</p>
<p>Although he had told himself he wouldn’t compete with Dad for Mommy’s attention after he helped him up the shopping cart today, he couldn’t help the mini jar of vinegar brewing within him now. Mastering culinary skills seemed to be a great way to win over Mommy’s affections, he nodded as he made a mental note.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s imposing figure in the kitchen left a permanent impression on the little bun’s mind.</p>
<p>“Honey, taste test it~”</p>
<p>With a flushed face and a forehead drenched in sweat, Yu Yaoyao plated the finished scrambled eggs and leeks. Despite the leeks losing all semblance of a leaf due to her haphazard knife skills, she decidedly scooped up a spoonful and delivered it to Shen Yichong’s mouth.</p>
<p>How in the world did she ever manage to cut the leeks to that state, only she would know. Rather than being chopped with a proper knife, the irregular strips looked more like an animal had gnawed at them and flung the leeks aside. It even looked a little dark, as if it had been charred.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised an eyebrow but opened his mouth, embarrassed by her PDA. She sent over the spoon into his mouth, the man chewed twice. The cold, unchanging, iceberg expression he always maintained suddenly fell and became distorted.</p>
<p>“Does it taste good?” Yu Yaoyao blinked expectantly.</p>
<p>Before Shen Yichong could make a sound, he felt a small hand tugging at his trousers.</p>
<p>One didn’t need to glance down to know who it was.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a thin voice filled with a sense of loneliness and abandonment slowly rang out:</p>
<p>“Mommy, I want to taste, too~” Q.Q</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s twitched, and was about to stop Yu Yaoyao …</p>
<p>…but she had already taken action.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao carefully hid the plate of scorched scrambled eggs behind her. Kneeling down to the little bun’s level, she smiled and brushed his cheek. “Lil’ Cub, you can’t eat the scrambled eggs Mommy made.”</p>
<p>You could hear the little guy’s heart cracking as a deep sense of loss clouded his clear eyes. Unlike other kids, he had never been able to eat his mommy’s cooking.</p>
<p>“This is something that the program crew had assigned to especially cook for your father alone.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she leaned closer towards the little bun’s ears. “Mommy just tasted it. It was a bit unpalatable. After eating it, you may fall sick. You’ll have to drink a lot of water and pee at night to get it out of your system.”</p>
<p>The little bun widened his eyes and stared. ”Then Dad~” His entire person didn’t look good. And what was this charred smell …</p>
<p>“My lil’ cub, be good and obedient, eat the asparagus and pork belly soup your dad made~” Yu Yaoyao chuckled and pecked his cheeks lovingly.</p>
<p>The child, however, continued to be curious. Yu Yaoyao finally relented and let him taste a single piece of the scrambled egg and asked him to lick it.</p>
<p>Shen Rui suddenly stuck his tongue out and chided- “So salty! Bleh! Salty!!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded her head as if she had already expected it. “There, there, go drink some water.”</p>
<p>The little bun immediately shot his dad a look of sympathy and ran away to cleanse his palate.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t help but the spot between his brows. <em>This woman, she already knew it was extremely salty, yet asked him whether it tasted good?</em></p>
