            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 161 – An Unexpected Gift (1)</strong></p>
<p>A number of delivery vans had arrived at the CEO’s villa bearing all kinds of flowers that he’d just ordered. In less than a minute, the entire living room of the villa was filled with flowers, so the rest were brought into the small garden outside.  All varieties of flowers in red, pink, white, yellow, and blue, which had beautifully blooming flower buds, added to the beauty of the villa!</p>
<p>Even after having lived for almost 200 years, Yu Yaoyao had never seen so many flowers clustered together. At the same time, the unexpected turn of events surprised Ni Yi.</p>
<p>“Sister, Boss Shen is really in love with you!” he said, excitedly.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao threw herself in the cluster of flowers, turned her face towards Ni Yi, and nodded in approval. Ni Yi suddenly realized, more clearly, that Yu Yaoyao had not just debuted with her own skills but with Shen Yichong’s influence as well!</p>
<p>“Sister, next week will be the boss’ birthday, do you remember?” Yu Yaoyao lifted her head in amazement as if she had had amnesia.</p>
<p>President Shen’s birthday was always celebrated privately every year but since he was working with Yu Yaoyao and had indirect contact with the boss from time to time, he knew his birthday.</p>
<p>Ni Yi sighed. “Sister, I think you should give the boss a gift.  He treats you so well and cares for you, and you should show how you feel for him particularly on special occasions. Please don’t disappoint him.”</p>
<p><em>The boss will absolutely appreciate whatever she gives him because he loves her dearly.</em></p>
<p>Even a fool could tell. Especially recently, although Boss Shen was busy with his work, he was still up to date about his wife’s whereabouts and sometimes even visited her set. Though she didn’t notice this, Ni Yi, who was always by her side, knew how much he cared for her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was a little puzzled. “Gift…”</p>
<p>She’d never given anyone a gift before and when she thought of what Shen Yichong liked, her mind just went blank and couldn’t picture anything that would suit his taste.</p>
<p>“Elder Sister, come here. I’ve already looked for some nice gifts for Boss Shen in Taobao.” Yu Yaoyao looked at her assistant’s phone with interest; however, in just a matter of seconds, she rolled her eyes out of boredom.</p>
<p>Taobao was the largest and most popular online retailer in China.</p>
<p><em>Pillows, teacups, scarves, ties… what are these? </em></p>
<p>“Nothing’s new! I think it is better for me to think of a gift myself…” Yu Yaoyao said.</p>
<p>She pushed the phone away in disdain and confidently patted Ni Yi’s shoulder.  “Ni Yi, it’s all right. I’d definitely prepare an unforgettable gift to amaze my husband!”</p>
<p>“Come on, take a picture of me lying in the flowers. Oh, I think jumping into the sea of flowers is a great idea. I really love all of these…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “…”</p>
<p><em>Good heavens! I have a bad feeling about this.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>In the car, Shen Yichong kept wondering whether or not Yu Yaoyao would like the present. He knew that she’d never liked flowers before. Therefore, once he reached home, the first thing he wanted to do was to carefully observe her expression.  He entered the door, looked around, and found no one in the living room. Soon, he heard a soft and excited voice coming from the garden.</p>
<p>“This is so beautiful, I am so delighted! The flowers are so gorgeous… I want to lie here; everything is so soft and fragrant! Ni Yi, can you move my little lounge chair to the garden? I want to sleep here tonight ~”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth was slightly parted as he looked at Chen Lin who was standing behind him and nodded in approval.</p>
<p>“At the end of this month, you will receive a 30% salary hike. Continue your hard work.”</p>
<p>Chen Lin was shocked by his boss’ sudden generosity. Soon, Shen Yichong waved for his assistant to leave and walked through the small door of the living room going into the garden. Amidst the bed of flowers, Yu Yaoyao, who was so cheerful, like a child receiving gifts from parents, held her long skirt and spun around in joyful circles.</p>
<p>The light blue skirt looked like a blooming begonia, forming ripples like lingering waves as she danced. Her silver bell-like laughter filled the garden, the curve on Shen Yichong’s mouth grew bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>Soon, Yu Yaoyao noticed him standing at the door and ran happily towards him like a puppy.</p>
<p>“Husband, you’re back ~” She snuggled up to his arm and pulled him into the sea of flowers. “I love these flowers you sent me!” she said and smiled at him sweetly.</p>
<p>A moment ago, she was mad at being deprived of her freedom to taste the cake and almost got lost in her conversation with the screenwriter. However, she didn’t expect to feel such amusement over this wonderful moment right now.</p>
<p>Yes, before she was caged in the zoo, she could see all kinds of scenery in the wild. Big and small flowers, green grass, trees, and a panoramic view:  the rays of the sun as it rose, playing with birds and insects in the bushes, watching beautiful sunsets and feeling the cool breeze blowing through the forest.</p>
<p>At that time, she did not know how to be happy and content nor cherish such moments. But after experiencing the loss of freedom and loneliness from imprisonment, she could now understand more deeply how beautiful these flowers were, that she would never get tired looking at it!</p>
<p>“Thank you, husband!” she said. She’d never felt this happy before nor after being reborn into this world, her eyes were glistening.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong finally relaxed his lips and smiled coldly. “It’s just flowers.”</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao pulled him excitedly and showed him the flowers one by one. “This one is the most beautiful, it is so big, and it has several layers of petals.  This flower is as red as an apple, it is so beautiful! And this…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t see much distinction from the flowers she was pointing to, but he patiently listened to her. Her chirping voice, at this time, was not as sweet and gentle as that of a sophisticated princess but in fact, reflected a little girl’s genuine and pure joy.</p>
<p>Her thin red lips were wide apart, revealing her white teeth. Looking at her, Shen Yichong suddenly felt a surge in his heart, his eyes couldn’t help staring at her.</p>
<p>As he gazed and gazed at the charming face, he was reminded of Li Tao’s words.</p>
<p><em>‘Is there such a fairy woman…’</em></p>
<p><em>‘I’ve only seen this kind of satisfaction when a woman receives jewelry and limited edition bags…’</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t help but move his finger as he felt happy and excited seeing the expression of his wife in front of him. He lowered his eyes, her face was a little red and he unconsciously pinched her small chin.</p>
