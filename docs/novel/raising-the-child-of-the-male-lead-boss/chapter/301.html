<p><strong>Chapter 462</strong></p>
<p>As for her roommate who fled back to the room like a rabbit as soon as she saw the camera, Fang Qiuye also smiled and waved at her. “Xiao Li, what are you doing? Come and eat a meal prepared by a fairy.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye happily opened the takeaway box in front of her. Other than two dishes with rice, there was also a bowl of tomato and egg drop soup.</p>
<p>Yaoyao was really a fairy! So excellent and considerate!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was reluctant to move her chopsticks. She took a picture and added a filter before she happily posted the photo to the fan group chat. Then, she posted it onto Weibo.</p>
<p><strong>[Gentle Temper: At this moment, I feel so lucky as if I was hit by a meteor shower. Yaoyao, you are the brightest and most beautiful star, you have hit my heart and filled my soul~ Today, my mood is beautiful because of you.]</strong></p>
<p>After expressing her feelings to the extreme, writer Fang Qiuye began to attack Yaoyao’s cooking.</p>
<p>The once quiet live broadcast room soon exploded as soon as Yu Yaoyao appeared, cooking and saying there was delivery for a few people. The comment section further exploded when Shen Yichong came to deliver the food himself.</p>
<p><em>[Was Mr. Shen driving a Maserati to deliver food? D*mn! Mr. Shen is the brightest deliveryman!!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Man, my head is bald. The internet speed wasn’t good, and I didn’t get a spot.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Damn! She even has a health permit!]</em></p>
<p><em>[This vegetable cutting gesture… You can see that she must have practiced hard. Did she learn it for the filming of ‘Youth Without Regrets’?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Little Bun is also in charge of washing vegetables? Gosh! When will the next takeaway be opened?! I want to try her cooking!]</em></p>
<p>There were two screens in the live broadcast room. The main screen was occupied by Yu Yaoyao cooking at home with Little Bun and in the sub screen, there was Shen Yichong making the deliveries.</p>
<p>At this moment, Yu Yaoyao was explaining to everyone how she obtained the health permit and was not operating illegally. Since the take-out platforms were now all standardized, food safety always came first.</p>
<p>They were supervised by a professional chef on site, and all the ingredients were sourced from the freshest and safest restaurant. While Yu Yaoyao wore gloves and masks throughout the operation, the kitchen utensils were also clean and free of any oil stains.  They all met the health standards.</p>
<p>Secretly, this business license was also to prepare for the coffee shop in the future. Director Zhao personally entrusted someone to do it. The mobile coffee and small food truck would also be operated legally.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s make steamed eggplant now.”</p>
<p>Wearing transparent gloves, Yu Yaoyao gestured towards the camera, gracefully lifting her face.  “Eat more vegetables so your skin can be smooth, supple and delicate. You’ll also less likely have acne and erythema. Every eggplant today was personally selected by Xiao Rui.”</p>
<p>After she finished speaking, Shen Rui proudly raised his chest and nodded his head solemnly. “The exterior is round, shiny, and without a single blemish.”</p>
<p>In front of the camera, Yu Yaoyao carefully cut the soft, cooked eggplants into thin strips of the same size, and drizzled them with sauce.</p>
<p>Comments were exploding frantically in the live room.</p>
<p><strong>[I want to be the eggplant in Yaoyao’s hand!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Suddenly I feel so lucky that our Yaoyao is not an online shopping anchor! Otherwise, I guess I can’t hold it!]</strong></p>
<p>And as soon as everyone finished howling, they heard Yu Yaoyao’s bewitching voice from the live broadcast room.</p>
<p>“Next up is today’s main dish, fried pork tenderloin with garlic.” After Yu Yaoyao finished speaking, she licked her lower lip. “The flesh on both sides of the vertebrae is tight and elastic, and the fat wrapped in it is soft and fragrant. When you roll it in the oil, the sound of sizzling is so pleasing to the ears.”</p>
<p>“Girls that eat meat will not have dull hair, and their bodies will not shrivel,” she began. “Boys who eat meat would be energetic, handsome, and athletic!”</p>
<p>Many people in the live broadcast room who were unable to make their orders could not bear it.</p>
<p>Director Zhao was too much.</p>
<p>A few audience members who managed to get their orders down agreed to be filmed while they were enjoying the meal, making the other audience envious and hungry on the spot.</p></div>
