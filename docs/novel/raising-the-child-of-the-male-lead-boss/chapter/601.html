            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 151 – A CEO’s Hidden Talents (1)</strong></p>
<p>Chen Lin, who was tasked with taking the little bun to his favorite zoo, was now seated on the rear seat of the car. The innocent face, full of melancholy next to him was bothering him to the core. Aside from him and the driver, there was also a nanny seated in the front seat. She’d be in charge of taking care of the little bun whilst in the zoo.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, halfway through their trip to the zoo, Shen Rui broke his silence and started to pose questions.</p>
<p>“Uncle Lin, do you think Mommy is thinking of me, right now?” Shen Rui asked, hoping that his uncle’s answer would enlighten him.</p>
<p>“Uncle Lin, do you think Daddy will scold Mommy again?”</p>
<p>“Uncle Lin…”</p>
<p>Just now, Chen Lin, a benevolent being, felt pity for the little guy.</p>
<p><em>My parents are filming at home for a reality program, and here I am, kicked out!</em></p>
<p>“Ah, I forgot to bring my plushy. Uncle Lin… Can we go back home and get it?” Shen Rui lowered his head and tugged at Chen Lin’s sleeve, waiting for his consent.</p>
<p>Little Bun always brought his big white snake plushie wherever he went except to school since he thought that other kids would borrow it and never return. He truly cherished this big toy and Chen Lin was well aware of it.</p>
<p>In a moment, his heart softened and he wavered slightly. He believed that it would not take unreasonably long for them to get the little boy’s favorite plushy and that they wouldn’t hinder the filming while doing so. Chen Lin turned around to look at little bun’s tender face… those huge misty orbs, and instantly surrendered.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s drive back home to get your beloved plushy.”</p>
<p>The little bun’s face instantly brightened.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>As of this moment, Yu Yaoyao was standing with her head bowed. It seemed like she’d given up and was in the midst of a confession. Shen Yichong, who had confronted her, was looking at her with a piercing gaze. This was a scene straight out of a courtroom interrogation, but for the surroundings.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a pen from a small cabinet near the wall and handed it to Yu Yaoyao. His eyes subsequently ran over the script as she wrote notes under his supervision. He would also push her to recite the lines from time to time.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who desperately wanted to sit down on the sofa, was picked up by her husband in a short while. Shen Yichong’s deadly glare with furrowed brows sent shivers down her spine.</p>
<p>“Stand up straight, raise your head, chest out, and tuck in your abdomen.” He commanded, sounding like a very strict commander instructing his troop. “Company’s training class, remember.”</p>
<p>With a grim face, Yu Yaoyao glanced at the cameraman next to Zhao Yu, her eyes filled with pleas for help.</p>
<p><em>Oh! Come on! A practice in front of everyone who is obviously filming me!?</em></p>
<p>“Husband, this is not how I read the script and practice my lines at home.” She boldly protested and sat down on the sofa slowly.</p>
<p>“As much as possible, we have to be honest with the audience. You can’t just deceive the public and use your beauty as a ruse to win them over.” Shen Yichong stated, massaging his temple.</p>
<p>“When I lie down, my mental ability heightens making me incredibly wiser.” She pursed her lips not willing to give up. “That way, it is easier for me to memorize my lines at once.” Shen Yichong stretched his hand and pinched the spot between his eyebrows as if he could no longer do anything about her.</p>
<p>Sure enough, as soon as she lay down, she obediently took up her script and started reading her lines. She even managed to finish adding footnotes on her script quickly.</p>
<p>The interaction between the couple was not only amusing but also very warm. It was akin to watching a rom-com except this was unscripted, original and one-take!</p>
<p>After the couple’s entertaining bickering, Shen Yichong decided to concede as he was now sitting on the sofa while Yu Yaoyao was lying beside him. The golden rays of the sun shone on them lending an exceptionally harmonious and quiet air. Though surrounded by many, they seemed to be in a blissful world of their own.</p>
<p>As a middle-aged man, Zhao Yu envied such a tranquil and relaxing picture in the afternoon. However, this setting did not last long as Yu Yaoyao, who was practicing her lines, snuck a peek at her husband, who was busy going over business documents.</p>
<p>As soon as she figured out that he was utterly immersed in his work, bored, she stretched her leg, deftly pressed the remote control to turn the TV on. At the sound, Shen Yichong looked down at her, only to find her pouting pitifully.</p>
<p>“I’m done with my part,” she said, in her defense.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong narrowed his eyes and said, “Again.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s small face suddenly turned bitter but she still recited her lines in order.</p>
<p>“…Your Majesty is working so hard… Osmanthus flowers blossomed yesterday and that is special….”</p>
<p>“There is one that looks very special,” Shen Yichong said in a low voice, as he tapped his wife.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao opened her mouth in shock, glanced at the script in her hands and tilted her head, leaning over to glance at her husband who was still going over the business documents.</p>
<p><em>Oh my gosh! I missed that one!</em></p>
