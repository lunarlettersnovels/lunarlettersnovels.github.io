            <p><strong>Chapter 379</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>‘Youth Without Regrets’ aired on Friday at 8pm as scheduled. As a youth drama starring Yu Yaoyao, the fans refused to watch it when it first aired. Many audiences who were obsessed with campus dramas were also relatively pessimistic about it.</p>
<p>This youth-themed drama was a prize for the winner of ‘In the Limelight”, and no one would ever have thought that the winner would be a married woman with a five-year-old son. In fact, ‘In the Limelight Rebirth’ was targeted towards the newcomers in the film and television industry.</p>
<p>Newcomers were usually under the age of 20. The youngest candidate at that time was only 15 years old and had to be accompanied by her father as she was underage.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao surprised everyone with the show and ended up winning the best protagonist award for the online drama. Even the producer and director team were surprised.</p>
<p>This made the final result all the more awkward.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was now a mother, but not only that, after her filming of ‘My Wife and I’ she also carried the strong image of a maternal figure. This made her portrayal as an underage girl a little less believable.</p>
<p>Later, her growth path went far beyond everyone’s imagination. She picked up minor supporting roles along the way and always went beyond expectations. There were times she even robbed the protagonist of their limelight, garnering herself big screen film critics’ praise. By then, her acting skills were considered mature, and she had a very positive image. Now it seemed all the more awkward to have played in this silly drama.</p>
<p>Coupled with the age difference between the male and female lead, this made YY fans worried. They wouldn’t dare watch it in fear that their image of her would be lowered by this online drama.</p>
<p>The fans gave all sorts of reasons as to why they wouldn’t watch it. But in the end, their deeds betrayed their words.</p>
<p>Other than her recent photo at the hospital, Yu Yaoyao had gone quiet. She hadn’t even been on Weibo. If her fans wanted to see her, they had to watch her latest work. It was this reason alone that many fans gave in and watched it. Even ‘A White Flower’, the deputy owner of the official Yu Yaoyao fan group caved.</p>
<p>‘A White Flower’s’ real name was Ye Yun. She was a company-level manager with a grossing annual salary of 100, 000 Yuan. And though she was no longer young, she was still single.</p>
<p>She had always admired Yu Yaoyao’s strong personality and how she persevered in the face of hardships. She also admired Yu Yaoyao’s beauty, and how she barely had to work hard to be so successful. She had been a fan of Yu Yaoyao as early as her appearance on ‘In the Limelight’.</p>
<p>She had never planned to watch ‘Youth Without Regrets’. But being single meant she had a lot of spare time after getting off work. Time she had to fill with something. It was because of this that she randomly decided to watch an episode.</p>
<p>Fans with VIP membership could skip all the ads that popped up. Without hesitation, Ye Yun spent a few hundred Yuan and bought herself the Diamond membership.</p>
<p>As the episode started, she kicked off her slippers and lay down on her bed. “I’ll just watch it for 10 minutes.” She glanced at the clock. It was 8:20pm. She would watch for 10 minutes then make dinner, have a bath, and put her face mask on.</p>
<p>10 minutes was more than enough for her to see Yu Yaoyao in this drama.</p>
<p>Ye Yun took off her wristwatch and put it beside her on the bed.</p>
<p>The next time she glanced up at the clock was when her stomach started growling. She went totally motionless with shock. It was already 9:20pm!</p>
<p>Had she really been watching this show for an hour already?</p>
<p>She hadn’t even made dinner or bathed!</p>
<p>Ye Yun clicked the screen in shock and glanced down at the progress bar. 62 minutes per episode… She had watched the entire thing.</p>
<p>“Gosh! Progress bar, hang in there!”</p>
<p>How was it possible that the progress bar was at the end already?</p>
<p>She hadn’t even realized how immersed she had become in Yu Yaoyoa’s character and the plot. She had watched the entire episode without even realizing it!</p>
<p>Ye Yun clutched at her hungry belly and moved her gaze to the episode selection section on the screen. There were only two episodes out and she had already finished watching one. There was only a single episode left…</p>
<p>She sat up abruptly and swiped the screen again. She read the information in the play bar and collapsed onto her pillow.</p>
<p>It was a weekly drama! Which meant only two episodes would be released every Friday!</p>
<p>Ye Yun logged on to her Weibo and joined the fan base.</p>
<p><em>[Strongly recommend it! ‘Youth Without Regrets’ is so good! Everyone should see it!]</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t be the only one falling in love with the show. It would be pitiful if she was the only one pining for new episodes every week! There had to be more people who felt the same!</p>
<p>It wasn’t long until stubborn fans started watching the show out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Just like Ye Yun, they also clicked on the episode with the intention of only watching the first few minutes.</p>
