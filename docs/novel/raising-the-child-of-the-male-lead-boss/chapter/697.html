            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 54 – Good Luck Kisses</strong></p>
<p>Ni Yi had strong affection for this mother and son pair. Earlier, he had also wanted to have a family of his own and raise cute children.</p>
<p>But as soon as he saw Shen Yichong, who was eating breakfast with a solemn face so early in the morning, he immediately woke up from his daydreaming and harped, “Sister, change your clothes and wash up. We’re ready to go. You can’t be late for the preliminary recording for the contest today.”</p>
<p>The recording was going to be shoot inside a small enclosed building near the TV station.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, relying once again on her husband’s excellent and strong background received a pass, no doubt. With this leeway, she could go home every day during the off-camera period.</p>
<p>“Okay,” she replied. Yu Yaoyao is after all, a very responsible person. Because her beauty was now going to be seen by a vast audience, the sleepiness disappeared instantly to be replaced with excitement on the spot.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the official Weibo account for <em>’Rebirth in the Limelight’</em> announced the background of the 88 contestants to partake in the program and the voting channel for the audience. She voted for herself with cheerful readiness and even forced Shen Yichong to vote for her with her mobile phone.</p>
<p>When she woke up in the morning and checked her account, she had already gained roughly about 3,000 fans overnight!</p>
<p>“Baby, give mom a kiss as good luck charm.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui the steamed bun shyly squeezed his dinosaur onesie’s little tail upon hearing this and pushed his little face towards his mommy who gave him a loud smack on the cheek.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hastily went back to her room to change clothes, while Ni Yi took advantage of the idle time to pack her breakfast to eat on the road.</p>
<p>A satisfied Shen Rui threw his small tail happily as he climbed into his highchair. But then he quickly looked at his ever-silent father and Ni Yi, who was busy packing sandwiches together with some orange juice.</p>
<p>Pouting his mouth, he knowingly said, “Dad, mom is going to work.”</p>
<p><em>Dad really doesn’t care about mommy!</em></p>
<p>Once, when he was a little boy, he often did not understand why his parents quarreled secretly. But now that he has become smarter, he feels as if he knows the root to the problem: <em>Dad isn’t as caring to mom as Uncle Ni is!</em></p>
<p>He did not give his mother good luck kisses every time when she went out to work, nor did he even arrange breakfast for her. He refused to wear the dinosaur onesie that his mommy had painstakingly bought with her hard-earned money!</p>
<p><em>Dad, really…no wonder mom is always unhappy and angry with you all day long, talking about how much she owes him! </em>Shen Rui picked up his fork irritably as comprehension dawned on him.</p>
<p><em>Dad is really too ignorant!</em></p>
<p>Turning to him, he brusquely said, “Dad, when you received mom’s gift, you didn’t even say a simple <em>‘thank you’</em>. All my teachers in kindergarten say that even if us children don’t like the gifts we received, we can’t show ungratefulness and hurt the giver’s goodwill.”</p>
<p>“Dad, you are doing a bad thing,” the small steamed bun whispered seriously as he looked down the floor.</p>
<p>He felt very exhausted. It hadn’t been an easy journey to get his mother’s affection, and now that he had it, his dad was also holding their family’s happiness back by acting difficult.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong ‘s lips pressed to a thin line as he placed the cup he was holding on the table.</p>
<p>“Where did you heard that dad didn’t thank her?”</p>
<p>The little steamed stuffed bun frowned, “It is even more wrong of you to lie like this.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s thick eyebrows furrowed at this reply.</p>
<p>Ni Yi drifted five meters to the side in an instant, trying to minimize his presence in the tense atmosphere of the dining room.</p>
<p>“I bought a thank you gift for your mother. <em>Five</em> bags.” Shen Yichong glanced at his son and pointed at the ceiling, “It’s still being delivered by air, to arrive in two days.”</p>
<p>The little steamed bun released a disbelieving breath, looking at him suspiciously. “Really?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong displayed one of his rare smiles and answered, “Hm.”</p>
<p>“Then dad, will you give mom a good-bye kiss too?”</p>
<p>The small steamed bun who had no pocket money nor expensive gifts rivaling that of his father to give to his mom, quickly jumped to another topic.</p>
<p>The smile on Shen Yichong’s face froze.</p>
<p>“Mommy said that it was her good luck charm before work.” The little steamed bun looked at his father persistently.</p>
<p>Only his dad can kiss his mom.</p>
<p>If his dad isn’t tenacious and vocal with his feelings, then his mom might be stolen by other uncles, just like what people gossiped online!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stretched out his hand and pressed his little head down towards his forgotten food, “Eat your food properly, Shen Rui.”</p>
