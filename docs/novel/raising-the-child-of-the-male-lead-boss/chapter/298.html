            <p><strong>Chapter 465</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong quickly couldn’t understand Yu Yaoyao’s motivation to learn English. He never knew that one could learn English like this… He never had to worry about his son’s study, nor was he a student that his teachers had to worry about, which was why he doubted if he had read the wrong textbook when it came to Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Little Bun could attend the online school and follow the teacher’s teaching. He would start from simple words and daily sentences, and he gradually improved from that foundation. He would only ask him on occasion when he really didn’t know some vocabulary.</p>
<p>As for Yu Yaoyao, Shen Yichong would feel a pain in his temples every time she asked a question.</p>
<p>But then she said in their mother tongue, “Darling, how about we do it tonight?”</p>
<p>Deep into the night was the best time to be romantic with each other. Shen Yichong was also a little moved.</p>
<p>However, in the next sentence, Yu Yaoyao asked, “How do you say this sentence in English?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he felt as if a basin of cold water was poured down on his head. Immediately, all his excited feelings were gone. Not only that, but he also had to help her translate.</p>
<p>Otherwise, she would look at him excitedly, “Oh, I didn’t know there’s vocabulary that you also don’t know!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong can only pray that his little girl would not be like her mother. If she had really taken after her mother, he could only pray for his future son-in-law. He wouldn’t be able to help him either!</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that his wife would always make learning English s*xual…Shen Yichong had no choice but to correct her a few times. But he gave up in correcting her when he found that she would always raise even weirder questions after that.</p>
<p>As long as she was happy. After all, she was his wife. He has to answer her no matter what. It was infinitely better than having her asking other people.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At the end of the screening of ‘Itch of the Year’, the major online platforms finally made this film one of their VIP pay-per-view films. In order to boost sales, these platforms also uploaded the unreleased behind-the-scenes shooting footage at the same time.</p>
<p>The suffering of the actors and actresses with Director Qi Hang’s NGs finally ended when Yu Yaoyao came! In the interview, Cai Fang and Lu Cheng all said that Yu Yaoyao was their savior. Qi Hang even said that she opened a new world for him.</p>
<p>Wei Ming, who had filmed the most scenes with Yu Yaoyao, even made a sincere speech.</p>
<p>“A shot wouldn’t normally pass without twenty NGs. It’s true that there are times when I’m not in a good state. The director is also a perfectionist. Even the movements of sitting down and standing up would have to be re-shoot for like 10 times,” she began. “At that time, I was used to it. There was nothing I could do. It wasn’t until Yu Yaoyao came…”</p>
<p>“During that period, I bet everyone knew she was emotionally unstable and something bad happened in her family. But she overcame her emotions. When she acted with me, she brought me into the play, and I got completely immersed into the role itself.</p>
<p>“Later, Director Qi asked me to learn from Yu Yaoyao. I hated the idea at first, but I finally realized there is no end to learning when I saw her notes in her textbook and script.”</p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes was revealed to fans for the first time. Although some of the interviews were exposed at the premiere, they were not as detailed as this feature video. When they saw the densely labeled scripts and textbooks, all the fans felt warmth flowing in their hearts.</p>
<p>She preserved even at a time when her blood-sucking stepmother and sister were making her life miserable. This little feat was comparable to a college student facing their college entrance examination!</p>
<p>Many mothers have also gained a good impression of Yu Yaoyao since ‘Youth Without Regrets’.</p>
<p><strong>[I’ll show this to my daughter later. Yaoyao should be her role model!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[A woman who is prettier and richer than you is still working hard! Girls who want to marry into wealthy families, have you finally woken up from your dream?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Let me look at what my sister wrote!]</strong></p>
<p>Many people started to leave comments.</p>
<p>As the camera zoomed in, everyone also saw Yu Yaoyao’s iconic annotations. The fans burst into laughter on the spot. On the same day, Yu Yaoyao once again got herself and Wei Ming on the hot search again.</p>
<p><em>#Yaoyao teaches people how to read the script</em></p>
<p><em>#Do you understand the pain of not being able to drink boba?!</em></p>
<p>As an art film, it was unexpectedly ranked among the top five on the platform on its first broadcast day!</p>
<p>Qi Hang, who had already started his next job and wasn’t really bothered about the results, couldn’t help but be shocked by the traffic Yu Yaoyao could generate. Back then, he didn’t know he had picked up a treasure with just a phone call.</p>
<p>He was so pleased and thankful that he finally called Director Li, who had been begging him to eat with him outside for a long time. “Li, are you free today? I’ll buy you dinner.”</p>
<p>Then, there conversation went as followed. “What? Why would I be stingy and refuse you an appreciation meal?! Huh? You want ten meals because Yu Yaoyao got the movie on 10 hot searches?! D*mn! Since when do you have such a good memory!? Fine, ten barbecues it is, as long as you don’t have a nosebleed!”</p>
