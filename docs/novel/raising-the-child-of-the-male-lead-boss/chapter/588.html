            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 165 – A Birthday Doll (1)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gladly opened the door and let the delivery man in. He was carrying a super large express box, the same height as an average person. He was gasping for air as he moved, the parcel seemed heavy.</p>
<p>Looking at his plight, Yu Yaoyao took pity and handed him a bottle of water and a juice pack.</p>
<p>“Cold, refreshing, and delicious~” she smiled sweetly as she said.</p>
<p>The delivery man blushed, he’s feeling embarrassed and hesitant to take the bottled water.  However, Yu Yaoyao waved her little hand and said, “Brother, take it, you are helping me move the box to my husband’s study. I want to return the favor at least~”</p>
<p>The delivery man smiled and held the high-quality mineral water, and was grateful for her generosity.</p>
<p>However, as soon as he entered the hall, he was shocked by the number of cameras inside.</p>
<p>“Come with me, brother, just imagine that there are no people and cameras inside.” Lu Yaoyao sensed his unease and persuaded him.</p>
<p>The guy listened to her and stared at the hostess before him. He couldn’t believe how beautiful she was. Time seemed to be moving slowly from the moment he saw her. He blushed all the way and never dared to look at her anymore.</p>
<p>It seems that the more you look at her beauty, the more prone to committing a blasphemy you were.</p>
<p>Once the package had been moved to the study, the man left while still holding the expensive-looking mineral water bottle.</p>
<p><em>I’m going to be on TV… I also met a beautiful goddess … and drank the water she gave… I can’t wait to tell this to my buddies waiting in the van!</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t until the door of the villa was closed that the delivery man smiled excitedly and immediately called his buddies! He had not yet realized that the moment he stepped out of the villa, his expression was recorded by the cameras set outside.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yu Yaoyao was alone in Shen Yichong’s study. Because she wanted the gift to be a secret, she asked all the camera crew to step out implying that she wanted to give her cold husband an extravagant surprise.</p>
<p>Soon, she unpacked the package, started checking the product’s quality and inspected the other aspects. Then, she tried to tie a beautiful bow on the package. But Zhao Yu, who was really curious, asked the photographer to take a picture of the closed door and record Yu Yaoyao’s soft voice that could be heard from the study.</p>
<p>“Wow, the shop owner wasn’t lying. Although it’s not as beautiful as I am, it’s still charming and brilliant! Hmm… Not bad! I’ll definitely give the shop the highest rating. All right! I am so excited to hear my husband’s feedback and see his reaction!”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was surprised.</p>
<p><em>What gift? Charming and brilliant, huh?  </em>His ‘little curious’ had heightened and he was excitedly anticipating the “unwrapping”.</p>
<p>What else do entertainers have to do when participating in this type of show? Yu Yaoyao was born to get through any kind of entertainment and showbiz obstacles, and Zhao Yu didn’t need Shen Yichong to teach her how to behave this time! In addition, Yu Yaoyao could do everything herself- she’d be funny with just her actions, even her jokes were more amusing and natural than the ideas that the screenwriters came up with!</p>
<p>As Zhao Yu mulled, and his eyes were on fire.</p>
<p><em>This Yu Yaoyao is still in her early stage and is destined to become a big star in the future. Her acting is professional, beauty outrageous, she can be funny all the time, and is a natural in front of the camera and leaves everyone spellbound. She is definitely a female artist of rare talent in the entertainment industry.</em></p>
<p><em>He should maintain a good relationship with her! </em>Zhao Yu was determined to do that.</p>
<p>In the show ‘My Wife and I’, there were other guest-couples too; an actor and a singer, who’re also famous celebrities in the entertainment industry, etc, etc. However, compared to Mr. and Mrs. Shen, their comic timing was lacking and weren’t as fetching either.</p>
<p>Besides, Zhao Yu, who was worried about dull scenes, had personally asked the screenwriter to make sure that the daily interactions of the other couples should be relatively cute and humorous, like the Shen Household.</p>
<p>Soon, they heard a door opening on the first floor. The director immediately realized that Shen Yichong had returned home. He turned to the cameramen, signaling them with his eyes to film the boss.</p>
<p><em>Later, we need to use a zoom lens and take close-up shots of the couple! We need to film both their expressions in detail!</em></p>
<p>This veteran had a hunch. He was so sure they’d be capturing an exciting moment shortly!</p>
<p>After a while, the steady footsteps got closer. Shen Yichong, donning a black suit and slippers, walked towards them with a straight face.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, still out even on weekends? What a busy person.” Zhao Yu greeted.</p>
<p>Scenes and people that had nothing to do with the show would not be included in the main film.</p>
<p>Shen Yi nodded in return. “Some business,” he said, frowning when he saw them carrying the camera around his study.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu smiled mysteriously and moved away from the door.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong wasn’t paying attention. However, he soon heard a thumping sound- like there were heavy objects being moved about, from his study. He raised his eyebrow, curious he walked towards the door. He was about to turn the doorknob but stopped and knocked on the door instead.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Inside, in panic, Yu Yaoyao moved swiftly. She didn’t expect her husband to return so early. Soon, there was a bang again, as she was smashing something really hard. Hearing this, Shen Yichong furrowed his brow, withdrew his hand from the doorknob and waited quietly for a moment, until no sound was heard.</p>
<p>Minutes later, the door was opened from the inside and he saw his wife emerge from the door wearing a lotus-leaf green small petticoat.</p>
<p>His cheeks suddenly blushed, his pointed and upright nose had a little sweat, even his heart was beating very fast as if he was doing a physical exercise.</p>
<p>His black eyes looked around the study. But his sight was soon blocked by Yu Yaoyao who turned around and moved in front of him. Her breathing was heavy with some hot air, and she smelled sweet as if freshly showered. She looked like she was exhausted from the thing she did alone inside the study. Her watery eyes flashed, and her slender little hand touched his tie, rolled it around her hands, and slowly pulled him towards her.</p>
<p>“Husband ~” Her voice mellow.</p>
<p>Shen Yi Chong’s eyes dimmed, he reached out to her petite hands and grasped it. He was looking at her in the eyes, still in front of the camera, and he thought that her actions were somewhat hot today. However, Yu Yaoyao didn’t care about the camera at all. Instead, she tiptoed, pursed her pink lips, and whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>“Husband, do you remember, I have a surprise for you?”</p>
