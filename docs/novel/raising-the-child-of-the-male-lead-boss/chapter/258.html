            <p><strong>Chapter 503</strong></p>
<p>Ye Yun and Fang Qiuye were both waiting in front of the screen. They were waiting for Yaoyao’s appearance while maintaining order in the fanclub. Other fans also took their seats early.  Soon, cars stopped in front of the red carpet, and entertainers in dazzling costumes appeared one after another. The reporters on both sides pressed the shutter desperately, and there were <em>flashes everywhere.</em></p>
<p><em>[Xiaoqi’s skirt is beautiful~]</em></p>
<p><em>[Wow, my brother Jiawei’s suit…my nosebleed!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Master Chen is still majestic.]</em></p>
<p>Everyone was very interested in the red carpet. The fashionistas also began to analyze and comment on which designer each clothing was from, its price, and which fashion show it appeared on. Fang Qiuye and Ye Yun, who were sitting in front of the screen, couldn’t help but start talking.</p>
<p>“Our Yaoyao is finally attending the award ceremony. She was even nominated for the best actress again. I can’t imagine how beautiful she will be this time.”</p>
<p>“Will she go last?”</p>
<p>Not only them, all the YY fans were full of expectations. Finally, the cast and director of ‘I Am a Killer’ entered the theatre and walked onto the red carpet. The flash suddenly lit up the whole sky.</p>
<p>The door opened, and Yu Bin, the male lead of ‘Killer’, got out of the car first. Amid the exclamations and screams at the scene, he bent down very gentlemanly and helped out the delicate woman who was still in the back seat of the car. The reporters at the scene were a little excited, and many people adjusted out their long-barrelled cameras. The fans in the live broadcast room were even more thrilled.</p>
<p>The slender legs that were half hidden by the diamond-encrusted dress stepped out of the car door first. Then, she stretched out her hand and elegantly placed it on Yu Bin’s arm. Finally, she slowly got out of the car. A pair of high heels with bright gold straps tied to the ankles daintily stepped on the red carpet, as if they were stepping on a fragile lotus.</p>
<p>She stood in the centre of the light, raised her head slightly, and brushed her bangs that had been touched lightly by the breeze. Her delicate and beautiful face was completely exposed in front of everyone. Her slim skirt had side slits, and the edges on both sides were full of diamonds; it was as if the design mirrored the milky way on her legs. The draping silk fabric did well to accentuate her beautiful figure. She wore a diamond pendant on her chest, and the V-shaped dress on the back showed her back line. Her swan neck, the peach bottom, still charming facial features, bright eyes that seemed to hide a deep pond… The picture at this moment was enough to drive many people crazy.</p>
<p><em>[Goddess!!]</em></p>
<p><em>[She seemed to have become even more beautiful after giving birth to Little Sweetheart?! My God, is this really a mother to two children?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I fell in love at a glance! The way she looked at the camera just now was so charming!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I would kneel down to her beauty!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’ll say no more. From today onwards, I will follow Yaoyao’s secret recipe – doing yoga and running every day!]</em></p>
<p><em>[This skin…I’m crying! Seems like I could pinch water out from it!]</em></p>
<p><em>[This killer is too beautiful!]</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hooked her arm with Yu Bin’s generously and stopped from time to time for the reporters on both sides to take pictures. She also waved to them and nodded with a smile. At one point, the atmosphere at the scene was at its highest, and the security guards felt a little nervous.</p>
<p>And when she got to the signature wall, everyone could see her beauty closer. At that moment, the comments in the live broadcast room almost flooded the whole screen. She took the pen handed over by the host. With a smile, she flipped through her gold ribbon handbag and took out a small circular piece of paper that made many fans almost scream!</p>
<p>That was the sticker that she asked both directors to help her bring to the signature wall, when she was absent from the Hundred Flowers Awards the year before!</p>
<p>“Showing everyone the results of my recent hard work in calligraphy.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled. She pasted the signature paper that Shen Yichong rejected for its ugliness the year before and signed a rather delicate autograph next to her amid the loud laughter. The audience in the live broadcast room laughed out loud.</p>
<p><em>[Hardworking Yao has appeared again!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I study hard just like my idol. I’ve just finished the college entrance examination in June and was admitted to Peking University. The score I got for that was also the highest in history! Hahaha!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Haha, I finally improved my English grades, so should we learn Chinese now?]</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao touched her nose shyly at the camera. “Recently, my Little Sweetheart is learning to write, but my previous calligraphy was too ugly, so the two men in the family asked me to practice hard,” she said. “Otherwise, they will deprive me of my right to teach and write.”</p>
<p>As soon as these words came out, even the surrounding reporters laughed. The host also chuckled. “So what do you expect today?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Uhhh..” When Yu Yaoyao encountered this question, she pondered  hard. “I heard that the ceremony won’t end until it’s eight or nine o’clock. Will you take care of the meal during the intermission?”</p>
<p>The host was stunned. “…No.”</p>
<p>The whole broadcast would be live. How would they have the time to eat?</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>As expected, Yu Yaoyao sighed in disappointment. Meanwhile, everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p><em>[Her handbag is bulging slightly. Don’t tell me she brought snacks?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I bet fifty cents that she must have brought something to eat! Is it a small pudding or chocolate?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Hamster Yao has appeared!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao: This award ceremony is trying to starve me to death!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen: Shall I send my wife a meal? She seems to have gotten thinner!]</em></p>
<p>Fans were entertaining themselves.</p>
<p>Soon, Yu Yaoyao entered the arena with the crew. In the venue, the camera was not fixed on any artists, given that there were too many of them. It would show the audience the entire scene from time to time, so that everyone could find the approximate seats of their idols.</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao sat down, she secretly opened her handbag. After taking a look, she heaved a sigh of relief. With a cheerful expression, she chatted with Director Liang and Writer Liu next to her. She wasn’t nervous at all. Instead, she chatted with novelty while scanning her surroundings.</p>
<p>It was the first time she participated in such a large-scale awards ceremony. Although she won two Hundred Flowers Awards before, she was absent for the ceremony. So, it didn’t feel real. Everything she saw today was fresh to her. Writer Liu also leaned into her ear from time to time, explaining something to her.</p>
<p>YY fans all smiled.</p>
