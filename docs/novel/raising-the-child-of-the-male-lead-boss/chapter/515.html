            <p><strong>Chapter 248 – My Husband Was Kidnapped?! (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>A Bun bun … heat pack was dropped?! </em>Gu Qianqian couldn’t believe that she fell for such an absurd joke! She wanted to leave and not have to look at this showoff Yu Yaoyao, but she sensed that the crews were looking at her. She held her breath and walked away from that place.</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian wasn’t a noob anymore. She had been in the entertainment industry for almost six years now. She knew that this area of work was darker than one could imagine. Everyone in the industry looked bright and pretty on the outside, but each had their own secrets. It was especially difficult for newcomers as they were oppressed by their seniors and given menial roles. If one managed to grab a good role for oneself, it would be snatched away.</p>
<p>Such was the entertainment industry, pretty as a picture, but cutthroat within.</p>
<p>These factors never fazed her. She had always been talented, with a good reputation when it came to acting. But today, her image was destroyed by this start-up and all because of her <em>stupid</em> misunderstanding! The more Gu Qianqian dwelled on it, the more embarrassed she became and all the more angry. She wanted to be done with the filming so she could leave soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao was leaning with her face covered in Shen Yichong’s chest, shy because of her error. She was awkward facing the reporters; she had messed up.</p>
<p>“Sis Yu, so you’re planning to have a second child, right? After this movie, when will the web drama <em>Youth Without Regret</em> start filming? Will we hear any good news next year?” one reporter asked enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, you seemed very worried when you heard the baby fell. Was it because both of you were trying for another baby?” another added.</p>
<p>“Sis Yu, last time you went to the hospital for malnutrition. Are you taking care of yourself now because of this very reason? Do you want a boy or a girl next?” yet another reporter blabbered.</p>
<p>The small blunder had entirely shifted the focus of the interviews and questions. Yu Yaoyao groaned weakly on Shen Yichong’s chest. He blocked many of the approaching microphones for her sake. “Could you please give her some space? She is afraid of heights. She needs some privacy to calm down, please—” But before Shen Yichong finished, Yu Yaoyao, who raised her face from his chest and faced the reporters, interrupted him “I do want a second child.” Then she lowered her face back to his chest.</p>
<p>Her species, before she became human, naturally bore many offspring every year. After Yu Yaoyao found out about her life as a snake, she didn’t enjoy being with people anymore. That was until she met Shen Yichong and fell in love.</p>
<p>When she mentioned the second baby, Shen Rui, who was still holding his mother’s hand, looked up and beamed. “I want a baby brother, or baby sister…I will love both of them,” he said. Shen Yichong looked down at his son who was still teary faced. He leaned down and wiped the tears away from his son’s face.</p>
<p>Shen Rui’s words drew the reporter’s attention. “A baby brother and a baby sister. So are you planning to have a third child as well?” they asked.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao lifted her face and nodded. “I would love to,” she looked at Shen Yichong with a smile, “but somebody is always busy with work.” The reporters blew the news out of proportions. And in no time, fans from every nook and cranny of the world were scrolling through the glaring headline: <strong>The long-awaited second baby of Sis Yu was knocked down by quasi-film queen Gu Qianqian!</strong> In the blink of an eye, several comments flooded in endlessly:</p>
<p><strong>【 Ah! My baby! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 No way! Isn’t Gu Qianqian shooting a film with Sis Yu? Was this part of the script? 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 No, I’ve been waiting for their second baby! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 What happened to Mrs. Y? How is she now? 】</strong></p>
<p>The fans were distressed, and many attacked Gu Qianqian on her Weibo. The articles had shown photos of Yu Yaoyao lying on the safety mat weakly, or sobbing on Shen Yichong’s chest, with her hands on her tummy. To aggravate the situation, GIFs of Gu Qianqian slapping Yu Yaoyao were plastered all over. But there was a message from Yu Yaoyao clarifying the situation, so the fans were a bit diffused after that. Many media outlets and marketing accounts issued statements to explain the situation:</p>
<p><strong>【 Feiyu Entertainment V: Our apologies. We made a mistake with this ‘baby’. According to the reporters on site, Yu Yaoyao dropped her heatpack after the jumping scene, so she asked her husband to find it.】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 Baba Magazine V: We apologize to everyone, the previous report has not been consistent with the actual situation, and it has been deleted. But according to our reporters, Yu Yaoyao couple claimed they wanted a second child, and maybe even a third!】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 Entertainment Express V: A false alarm! But Mrs. Shen claimed that her husband was not cooperative enough to make a baby! Let’s cheer for Mr. Shen! 】</strong></p>
