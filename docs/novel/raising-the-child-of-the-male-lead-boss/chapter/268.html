            <p><strong>Chapter 493</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was full of confidence while Shen Yichong’s expression was quite subtle.</p>
<p>“Uhh… where.. where’s Baby Rui?” Director Li felt very awkward. As usual, Yu Yaoyao’s personality was still the same while she was shooting with the ‘Flourishing Age’ crew.</p>
<p>“Oh! Little bun went out with Chen Lin and Ni Yi to pick flowers for his little sister. There is a big black dog in the garden next door. He likes it. He plays with it every morning when he goes out to pick flowers,” Yaoyao said. The two had already become companions.</p>
<p>Director Li listened and nodded. “Children are fond of cats and dogs,” he began. “Da Fu’s new movie also has a chance to become a hit. After all, it’s the first pet movie in China with special effects. I heard that they’re already looking for a male protagonist; has the cat character been confirmed?”</p>
<p>“Is it set for next year? I’m also looking forward to it. I look forward to Da Fu’s work. He had a lot of ideas when he was on the set.”</p>
<p>Director Li ranted on. He hardly talked about anything else other than movies. He seemed to be a little obsessed.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, knew the progress of the script very well. She was communicating with Little Sisi, and would sometimes go online to check the situation. She was very concerned about the movie she was determined to invest in. Thus, she even gave suggestions for the cat protagonist.</p>
<p>As she lived at the zoo the longest, she knew best what kind of breeds and what kind of actions from the furry animals the humans liked. They loved it when animals were being cute! Playing cute to the extreme! Rolling around the ground to show its belly and paws, then looking at humans with big eyes like a baby… this was what the stupid giant panda next door did every day!</p>
<p>The next was being picky like royalty. The panda only ate the innermost part of the bamboo where the core was tender. Anything that was hard on the outside was thrown away! Shen Yichong said that she was adorable, but she was no match to the round panda!</p>
<p>The popularity of the panda was too much. From its head to its body, the bottom, and its short tail, all of them were round in shape! It was simply insidious and cunning; growing up like that was foul play!</p>
<p>“Uh… Xiaoyu, you seem to be quite experienced?” Director Li said, looking at her with an unsure glance.</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth also twitched. “Is there nothing else you can compare with? Must you compare with pandas?”</p>
<p>What a high ambition she had! Only then did Yu Yaoyao realize that she had said it before she knew it. She must have been infected by Big Head…</p>
<p>“Well… It’s not like what I said was wrong anyway,” she replied, pouting. That giant panda was truly a strong enemy in her past life. “Anyway, Da Fu’s cat movie must defeat that giant panda! The cat fans must surpass the fans of the giant panda!”</p>
<p>They must defeat that shameful animal who always acted cutely!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows furrowed together.  Li Bo always thought something was a little funny, but he didn’t know what it was.</p>
<p>“Xiaoyu, this might be a little difficult,” he began. Li Bo had always been blunt. Otherwise, he would not have pointed out how he thought he was a mere pretty face before. He said whatever he wanted, regardless of the person’s background.</p>
<p>“Pandas, as the treasure of our nation, are not only cute, but they’re also rare. It would be hard for cats to beat them. Of course, from the perspective of the owners, their cats are always the cutest,” he explained. “But for the public, they might still prefer the pandas.”</p>
<p>There was nothing worth arguing about this issue. For Li Bo and Shen Yichong, who are very mature, it wasn’t worth their time. At most, they could analyze which of the two animals were more popular in the market from the results of their next movie.</p>
<p>But for Yu Yaoyao, this was a very important issue. The only thing that made her feel suffocated for the past two hundred years was that round, chubby animal with its thick waist!</p>
<p>“Director Li, is the giant panda cuter than me?” Yu Yaoyao pouted. “Is it possible for us to add a scene where I go to the zoo to see the giant pandas in this script?”</p>
<p>Li Bo: “…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pursed his lips and showed an apologetic smile to Director Li. Then, he stretched out his hand and embraced Yu Yaoyao’s waist.</p>
<p>“The zoo here doesn’t have one,” he said in his usual coaxing tone. “You can add it to Da Fu’s script.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Da Fu’s script? Shall we make the protagonist a stray cat who aims to surpass the giant panda?! Yes! Its dream is to become more popular than the giant panda!” Yu Yaoyao quickly noted the idea and decided to add it to the script later.</p>
<p>“A character is full of dreams… Darling, I want to dub it!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt a headache coming. “Tell that to Da Fu yourself. You’re also part of the investors,” he relented.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll add that to the second season if I can’t add it in the first~” she said, beaming at him. The more Yu Yaoyao thought about it, the more excited she became. “I’m going to call it the ‘<em>Dream Project!’</em>”</p>
<p>Li Bo was stunned when he heard it. Although he had just entered the film industry for the big screen, he had been a TV director for nearly ten years. More or less, he had some insight into what a good story needed to have. After reading through some scripts, he could predict how it would do with the audience.</p>
<p>A plot can only be considered attractive if the characters are soulful.  If he were to be honest, Da Fu’s animal film was inherently risky, although it might appeal to cat lovers. Whether the cat characters should have thoughts and anthropomorphic behavior was a question that needed careful consideration.</p>
