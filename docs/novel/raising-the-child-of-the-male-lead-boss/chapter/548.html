            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 212 – Untimely Visitor (1)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was ready to take a bite out of her piece of steak when the familiar chiming of the doorbell interrupted them. She couldn’t help but feel a bit dismayed.</p>
<p>It’s quite untimely.</p>
<p>However before she could do anything, Shen Yichong had begun to put down his fork and moved to stand.</p>
<p>“I’ll go get the door, you can keep eating.” He told her when Yu Yaoyao immediately shot up her seat and gently pushed him back on his seat.</p>
<p>“No no no! Honey, I’ll go!” She insisted. Meanwhile, in her mind, she thought that the more he moved, the more he would consume energy, which would make him go hungry quickly, making him eat more.</p>
<p>And the more he ate, the more money would be ultimately spent. And since she was more petite, she would consume less energy. It was perfect.</p>
<p>She would be the one to get the door!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows in surprise at her insistence, completely oblivious to her thought process, but he didn’t refuse.</p>
<p>Eventually, Yu Yaoyao walked to the door. When she opened up the door, she was greeted by a familiar pretty face…</p>
<p>“Sis, I’m back.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was mentally gobsmacked at her presence as she stared at Yu Xinjie’s bright smile. However, it didn’t take long for the smile to vanish from Yu Xinjie’s lips.</p>
<p>“You’re eating?” she asked, practically aghast in what happened.</p>
<p>But Yu Xinjie was here…</p>
<p>Not earlier, not later, but now…during dinner! She thought in a slight panic! This bitch was even more sinister than in the book!</p>
<p>“Who are you?” she asked, despite knowing the answer. Yu Yaoyao wanted to just shut the door but managed to hold it in, opting to just close the door.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie’s face twitched, but quickly blocked the door, “Sis, I’m Xinjie, did you have a concussion and forgot about me? I’m your dearest sister!”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie could see the cameraman behind Yu Yaoyao when she poked her head to look inside.</p>
<p>Even though she was abroad, she knew that Yu Yaoyao was filming a couple’s reality show called “My wife and I”. It was a very popular show.</p>
<p>With that thought, she put on a sad and concerned expression in front of the cameras.</p>
<p>“Where were you hit, Sis? Did your body get affected so you don’t answer my call?”</p>
<p>Sure enough, the cameraman was interested and moved the camera closer to view their expressions more. Yu Xinjie smirked to herself in thought, she’d managed to play the part of the caring, yet victimized sister, so quickly at that.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, wanted to throw up! Yu Xinjie was so shameless, it was giving her all the wrong vibes. And what’s this about being her <em><strong>dearest </strong></em>sister? Ha! She’s only a half-sister at best.</p>
<p>Her mom was a mistress, and stole her mother’s husband! Yu Xinjie was no different from that conniving mother of hers, full of insidious thoughts, and coveted everything her sister had! It was very hypocritical of her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao narrowed her gaze. If she loved drama so much, then she wouldn’t mind playing along.</p>
<p>“Ah? I didn’t recognize it.” Yu Yaoyao took on a shocked look as she drew closer to Yu Xinjie’s face, “Your nose is quite tall, and did you have an injection for your chin? Oh, did you raise your forehead too?” she asked as if genuinely curious, but knowing full well she was being rude.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie’s smile froze on her face, her body simmering with rage at the blatant way Yu Yaoyao pointed it out.</p>
<p>“Sis, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Oh my, your mouth seems a little unnatural with your smile, and even a little crooked.”</p>
<p>The grip Yu Xinjie had on her suitcase was tight, her knuckles turning white. Any tighter and it would seem like her blood would burst from her veins! Managing to calm herself down a little, Yu Xinjie gripped onto Yu Yaoyao…</p>
<p>“Sis, what are you talking about, for so many years, you still like joking around.” she barely managed to say without seething, “ I came to find you and Yichong right after I got off the plane, I’m so worried about you. Is Yichong’s company alright….”</p>
<p>“Everything’s fine~!” she answered with a bright smile and in a sing-song voice. Yu Yaoyao had seen her hand coming from a mile away, so she leaned her body sideways, and closed the door a little.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie slapped her hand directly on the door, and she winced at the sound it made. If that slap would have landed on her, it would hurt!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao may not be good at other things, but she was very sensitive when it comes to danger.</p>
<p>But seeing the obvious rage behind Yu Xinjie’s eyes, she couldn’t help but giggle in amusement. Yu Xinjie was so angry, she was beginning to turn red.</p>
<p>“Sis, you’re not inviting me in?” she asked with a subtle growl. Sighing, Yu Yaoyao threw her hands up in resignation, before opening the door.</p>
