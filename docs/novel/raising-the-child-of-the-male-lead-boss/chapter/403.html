            <p><strong>Chapter 360</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao clicked her tongue. Then, she turned her head and said to Shen Yichong, “Darling, the juice tastes so much better than the coffee. Don’t you want to get some for our baby? He’s been waiting for us in the car for a long while already; he must be bored!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong gently touched her forehead. “I will squeeze him juice when we get home. You should drink less of it too. The honey isn’t as good as the one we have at home.”</p>
<p>“Alright then. I’ll wait until we get home,” Yu Yaoyao said as she stood. She was about to pick up her bag from that empty seat, but she was suddenly blocked by Chen Jiao. He had a dull, almost grey expression. “Bro, please move.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao panicked and hurriedly stepped out of the way. Her small bag touched his arm. The scent of a small, white flower filled his nostrils immediately. He looked back at her, instantly struck by the way her frizzy hair lay playfully over her shoulders. He almost reached out and ran his fingers through it, but a powerful hand grabbed him around the wrist.</p>
<p>A chill ran down Chen Jiao’s spine.</p>
<p>“You’d better stay away from other people’s wives,” Shen Yichong said coldly.</p>
<p>Then the couple left the café, surrounded by bodyguards. Chen Jiao leaned against the windowsill, struggling to regain his senses.</p>
<p>He only loved himself?</p>
<p>No! That wasn’t true. His heart had unmistakably started racing when she’d walked past him.</p>
<p>In the depth of Chen Jiao’s eyes, a dim light started twinkling.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao and Shen Yichong walked hand in hand as they made their way outside. Once they were away from prying eyes, Yu Yaoyao pulled her hand out of Shen Yichong’s grasp and dug her phone out of her bag. She changed Chen Jiao’s name in her contacts to ‘Freaking Gangster’.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. “If you don’t want to speak to him, just block him.”</p>
<p>It didn’t matter if Chen Jiao was a brilliant actor. He was still just an artist like the rest of them. It didn’t matter if Chen Jiao had a hundred times the wealth he had now, he would still lose to Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>If Shen Yichong wanted to ban him right out of the entertainment industry, it wouldn’t be impossible, just a little troublesome.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao huffed heavily and said, “I don’t want to. I still want to be able to scold him when he is misbehaving,” this was a promise to the original owner of her body, “You said he wouldn’t do anything bad. But now look at what happened. This guy is very cruel. Ling Shuang’s b*tchy face is about to take on the visage of a fat pig’s head,” as she said this, she patted her chest in fear.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows, “He wouldn’t dare to attack you. I’ll get people to watch him. I will find you two female bodyguards for when you’re working.”</p>
<p>“Female bodyguards?” Yu Yaoyao blinked as she stared at the muscly bodyguards standing around them.</p>
<p>“Yes. So they can go in and out of your dressing room,” Shen Yichong took her hand. He didn’t want to openly say that he didn’t want other men hanging around her when she was alone. In fact, he even felt a little uneasy at the thought of another woman alone with her.</p>
<p>In his dream last night, he had dreamed of the novel plot the little girl in the investment department had mentioned. In his dream, the face of the female lead became Yu Yaoyao’s. She had one-handedly pushed the brilliant female student onto the desk and lowered her head to kiss her.</p>
<p>To say the least, he’d woken up in a cold sweat that morning.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>On their walk to the car, she thought up another problem. She touched Shen Yichong’s hand as he reached out to open the door for her. “Darling, I have a question for you,” she said.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised an eyebrow at her. He had a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>And he was right. Yu Yaoyao looked him up and down with her big, watery eyes and said, “Just now, Ling Shuang called you ‘Big Brother Shen’. What did she mean by that, huh?” as she spoke, she stretched out her hand, grabbed him by his tie, and pulled him down towards her. Then she reached out and gripped his chin with her other hand. “Tell me.” Her eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth pressed into a thin line, but then he chuckled. He lowered his head and kissed and nipped at Yu Yaoyao’s cheek. “Why? Are you jealous?”</p>
<p>Her fair, pretty face was all he saw. She wasn’t wearing any makeup, and her cheeks had gone red from sitting in the air-conditioned room. He found this adorable.</p>
<p>As she spoke, she puffed out her cheeks and pursed her soft red lips. This only made him want to take her into his arms and kiss her even more.</p>
<p>His wife was jealous.</p>
<p>She loved him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t help that he smiled, and he couldn’t help that he wanted to tease her just a little more.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt attacked. She pressed her hand against his chest and leaned desperately backwards. “I’m talking about serious stuff here! Don’t do that!”</p>
<p>“Do what?” Shen Yichong’s voice was low and deep. Her soft words sent a pleasant tingling sensation racing over his chest. He leaned in close to her ear and exhaled over the exposed skin of her neck. “I only do… You.”</p>
<p>“Shen Yichong! Are you the devil!” Yu Yaoyao cried.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen, usually stoic and serious, finally laughed out loud on the streets, for the very first time. He just couldn’t help himself.</p>
<p>But the moment didn’t last long. Little Bun suddenly stuck his head out the car window and shouted, “Devil Daddy! Don’t you bully Mommy! Come at me!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong suddenly stopped laughing and his face went passive. The nerve of this little kid. What on earth had he been watching on TV recently?</p>
