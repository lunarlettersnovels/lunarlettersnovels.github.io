            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 201 – Warm Affection After Years (1)</strong></p>
<p>Propping her chin on the back of her hand, she deliberated. After a while, she raised her delicate hand, reached out and pressed it on his black hair. She gently caressed and patted down.</p>
<p>Her husband may look very cold, but it unexpectedly felt good to pet him … His hair may be rougher than little bun’s, yet it was still very fluffy.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s lips curled upward, but she quickly paused and looked reassuringly. “Husband, the crew gave us 888 yuan~”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was taken aback. He had been distracted just now. He had been gazing at her as she held their son and warmly counted the money while sitting by the window seat of the car. A hint of the orange sunset tinted her side profile and made it seem like her delicate features radiated a golden glow. A gentle halo of motherhood along with her natural elegance amplified her grace.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong lost himself to the daze as he watched her.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, he felt a soft little hand brushing his hair. Taken aback, he looked at the person. In the past twenty years, no one had cared, dared to so gently and lovingly caress him. This rare gentle touch rendered him speechless. Then he heard her soft hymn of acknowledgement. He couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>
<p><em>Unexpectedly, 800 yuan (115 USD) had made her so darn happy.</em></p>
<p>Before he could finish laughing, Yu Yaoyao had already retrieved her hand from his head. “Husband, if we spend this money frugally, we can make do with almost 2 to 3 meals worth! I probably wouldn’t have to spend money out of my own pocket to buy groceries for tomorrow~” She grinned, satisfied as a kitten.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded subconsciously. He didn’t realize the meaning behind her words until much later. All his attention was fixated on the small paw that had been fondling his hair. When her petite hand left his head, his bright smile faltered, and the sense of loss he was hit with made him feel as though his previously good mood was merely an illusion. His black pupils tilted down and he couldn’t help but fixate on the dainty hand she withdrew.</p>
<p>She switched to caressing their son’s silky crown instead.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth inadvertently arced down. She had started caring a lot more for their son these days</p>
<p>But … Why did this make him feel uncomfortable deep down his heart?</p>
<p>“Shen Rui, haven’t you become very heavy these days? Mommy can’t keep holding you. Sit on the side seat by yourself.” Shen Yichong suddenly blurted out.</p>
<p>He was shocked by his own words. All the same, he coughed and turned his head away.</p>
<p>“You are going to start going to school very soon. At that time, you can’t have your mother accompany you to school just so you can continue sitting on her lap.” Shen Yichong felt justified as he continued. “Moreover, your mother’s legs would start getting sore after some time.”</p>
<p>He was using the same biter medicine his son always used on him. Sure enough, as soon as he had finished speaking, he received a mournful and condemning look from the little bun.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao laughed and lifted her arms to showcase her non-existent muscles. “It’s okay, Mommy can manage to hold you. After getting out of the car, Little Bun can walk by himself~.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Mommy!” The little bun smiled and diligently nodded, falling back on his mother’s chest afterward. Turning his head, he gave his father a particularly brilliant smile to show off.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…..”</p>
<p>Soon, they arrived at the nearest supermarket. Shen Yichong took the lead, got out of the car, and walked to the other side to open the door for Yu Yaoyao. It would be difficult for her to get out of the car with a child in one hand and a small purse in the other.</p>
<p>He lent his hand to support her as she stepped out. But soon, another little hand squeezed its way between them. Shen Yichong lowered his head and saw the smile of his son declaring war on him.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao glanced at the strange father-son duo. “Let’s go to the supermarket, shall we? Little Bun, come over here, Mommy has something to say to you.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pursued his lips, they were treating him like air. Going directly to the imports section, he grabbed a shopping cart.</p>
<p>Right then, Director Zhao Yu reappeared. “Remember! You need to cook a dish for each other, don’t cook dishes with each others’ help! Since you have very little time left, I suggest you decided the dishes first. You may browse Baidu to look up recipes if you want.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he shot a worried glance at Yu Yaoyao, who had ‘never cooked’ before.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Yu Yaoyao’s eyes lit up as soon as he mentioned ‘Baidu’ and ‘recipes’. She immediately flung out her phone, perhaps to search for recipes.</p>
<p>Director Zhao breathed out a sigh of relief and immediately disappeared.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s begin!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was fired up! As they pushed the cart, the little bun reached out to hold Yu Yaoyao’s hand.</p>
<p>But soon, the little bun’s envious eyes fell on a little girl next to him. The little girl was sitting in the shopping cart being pushed by her parents. She chomped on a lolly while her mommy and daddy shopped.</p>
<p>Little Bun suddenly felt a little ticked in his heart and glanced at the shopping cart his father was carelessly pushing with a single hand. He didn’t deliberately sabotage his parents from holding hands at the car earlier.</p>
<p><em>But… Who told Dad to deliberately not let him sit on Mommy’s lap?</em></p>
<p>Dad bullied him, so Little Bun decided to get even with regards to his father.</p>
<p>He glanced at the little girl who was being happily pushed by her parents and then at the sparkly-eyed Yu Yaoyao. He felt distraught.</p>
<p>He also wanted to be pushed … To be pushed while shopping with mom and dad together …</p>
<p>He wanted to play and spend time with both his parents …</p>
<p>The little bun subconsciously started slowing down and trailing behind bit by bit.</p>
<p>But just when he was feeling down and was about to give up on his fantasies, his feet were suddenly lifted off the ground, the shelves in front of him seemed to move till he felt his little butt touch a squeaky wire fence.</p>
