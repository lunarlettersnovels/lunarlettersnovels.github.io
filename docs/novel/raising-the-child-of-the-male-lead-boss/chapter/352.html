            <p><strong>Chapter 411</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>When Chen Cheng saw the ID of ‘my wife is doing pretty good recently’, his entire body went number and his fingers felt cold</p>
<p>Shen Yichong!</p>
<p>It was Shen Yichong!</p>
<p>Was there something wrong with him? He wasn’t using his main account, but he’d made another account just to praise his wife?</p>
<p>Chen Cheng felt like he could have vomited blood. He didn’t want to read what the account had written. But he had no choice. Shen Yichong had tagged Wansheng Group’s official Weibo in the post.</p>
<p>The passage written by ‘my wife is doing pretty good recently’ wasn’t only flattery, but it was also sharp and direct. It blatantly denied the previous argument that had belittled Yu Yaoyao’s acting skill and tried to promote Du Jingya in her stead.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind Shen Yichong’s argument was simple; the former had no background story, while the latter was an excerpt from the passage of ‘Allure’, and the characters were taken from the novel. The former only had the setting of the small black house, while the latter had the battlefield background setting built by the entire crew. The former was wearing modern, casual clothes without makeup, while the latter was wearing a well-made Hanfu with a headdress and full makeup. The former did not have any NGs and performed on-the-spot, while the latter, according to the news, was the finished clip after six NGs and after being directed by the director. There was even a music bgm, which moved people to tears.</p>
<p>Therefore, the two clips were not comparable at all.</p>
<p>If someone wanted to compare their skills with Yu Yaoyao, they should also improvise on the spot.</p>
<p>In addition, the subsidiary account also made a 10-minute, short video, showing the joy, anger, and sorrow of the two in their different scenes; a crying scene by Yu Yaoyao was followed by a crying scene by Du Jingya. A big laughter scene followed by Du Jingya’s laughter scene and so on.</p>
<p>At the end of the video, the account wrote, “Every person has a 1000 different faces. How then, can they be compared?”</p>
<p>Fans and passers-by upvoted the passage as soon as they saw it.</p>
<p>After Chen Cheng read it, his mood only became worse. “Asshole!” he shouted.</p>
<p>With one sweep of his hand, he cast all the marketing materials on Du Jingya off the table and onto the floor.</p>
<p>He couldn’t find a single reason to refute Shen Yichong’s counterarguments! Shen Yichong deserved to be a well-known visionary in the industry. With one simple glance he could tell how much worth an artist could bring to the industry.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>After watching the video, even he was also convinced. If he felt that Yu Yaoyao’s edited clip was even better than what had been shown now, what must the public be thinking?</p>
<p>Du Jingya did have acting skills. But her performance was more restrained than Yu Yaoyao’s. He knew this could be because she’d spent so much time being low-key and picking up supporting roles.</p>
<p>If one were to look only at her crying scenes, the performance was beautiful. But if one looked at other clips, there started to emerge a pattern of similarity.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand; her character, voice, smile even her tearful face were difference each time. The audience could get a feel for the character through her acting. Her performance was ever-changing, exquisite, and beautiful, which became a timeless trait among the audience. It made them want to dig deeper into her content to see what other surprises there were.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng himself was also a professional entertainment investor.</p>
<p>After he’d watched the video twice, he gave a dejected sigh.</p>
<p>Aside from her acting skills, Yu Yaoyao had room for even more growth and would no doubt have a long-lasting career in the entertainment industry. She had a face that the audience never got bored of, and an adaptable temperament.</p>
<p>Du Jingya had lost.</p>
<p>Wansheng had lost again.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng squeezed his eyebrows and looked down at the new comments that had suddenly surged through.</p>
<p>People who were still criticizing them for making use of a pregnant woman were now refuting Wansheng’s comment on acting skills:</p>
<p><em>[Haha… Comparing their acting skills? How can you compare when the situation was unfair to begin with?]</em></p>
<p><em>[What ‘My wife’ said does make sense. How courageous is Du Jingya that she dared to compare a final shot with a live improvisation?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Beautiful counterattack!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I could watch this video clip all day! Our Yaoyao can express so many expressions that give people different feelings…What about Du Jingya? Haha… She only knows one style of crying. Her crying scene was so cringy!]</em></p>
<p><em>[What I don’t understand is that my sister is not an actress by training, nor is she an award-winning actress. How come there are so many people that want to compare their acting skills to hers? In the end, they all humiliated themselves and suffered a complete defeat! Hey, I would advise these people to just pick up supporting roles. You should know what you’re capable of, so stop trying to generate traffic online!]</em></p>
<p>Chen Cheng blushed. It would be an understatement to say that Shen Yichong’s passage had really slapped him through the face. And these comments from the public felt like a foot right on his face, dehumanizing him like he was dirt.</p>
<p>Right. The reason why Wansheng had used Yu Yaoyao to make the comparison was because they wanted to use her traffic to build momentum for Du Jingya. They never could have expected the penalty they’d have to pay for this.</p>
<p>Not only did they fail to improve Du Jingya’s image, but they had also landed themselves in danger!</p>
<p>Well… At least they’d improved her fame.</p>
<p>It was obvious that most passers-by and general audiences had no good feelings towards Du Jingya, but they had all solidified their love for Yu Yaoyao.</p>
