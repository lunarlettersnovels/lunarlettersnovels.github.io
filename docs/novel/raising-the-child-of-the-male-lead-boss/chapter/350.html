            <p><strong>Chapter 413</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s perfectionist nature and habit of becoming a slave to his wife were both evident in the broadcast room.</p>
<p>Everyone thought the entire family was hilarious.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen was a successful and honorable man, but he acted like a mother hen, always paying attention to the smallest of details. His actions at home served as a sharp contrast to his domineering character in the public.</p>
<p>Now that everyone could witness the family’s private life, they were quite surprised by what they saw. They also got to see their constant love and affection for each other.</p>
<p>By the time Yu Yaoyao had woken up and had her breakfast, the flood of bloodthirsty comments online had been suppressed by a wave of compliments.</p>
<p>In the trailer for ‘Year Itch’, she played as a 36-year-old woman who had ended up failing her family, and then her career. After her divorce, she was overcome with the feeling of worthlessness. It wasn’t until her friend gave her a stern talking to and brought her back to her senses, that she mustered up the courage to start working hard to pursue a new life.</p>
<p>Everyone on the Internet was praising her when the pilot for the film came out. No one had ever expected her to perform so well in a play like this. People were utterly convinced and drawn in when they watched the clips.</p>
<p>She had easily abandoned her image and taken on the role, regardless of the different characteristics it required from her.</p>
<p>In the comment area, many of them were saying that they looked forward to the release of the new film.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your compliments. I humbly accept all the praise.” Yu Yaoyao was in a great mood.</p>
<p>But after scrolling to see a few more posts, she noticed something was wrong. The look on her face suddenly became solemn.</p>
<p>“Darling… Darling, everyone seems to have found out that I’m pregnant! Did I sleep-talk while you were doing the live broadcast yesterday?” She stretched out and grabbed Shen Yichong’s sleeves, with an expression that pleaded innocence.</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room couldn’t help but laugh again:</p>
<p><em>[Our Yaoyao is so confused.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao: It wasn’t me! I really didn’t say anything!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Why did they keep it a secret? Is it because the pregnancy is still a little unstable?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Her fighting scenes must have made the couple worried about the baby, which was why they didn’t want to announce the news too early.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Little baby, please stay strong!]</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong touched her head. “It wasn’t you talking in your sleep. I shared the news on Weibo.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao puffed out her cheeks and shouted, “You told me not to share the news on Weibo, and you told me not to tell people, but here you are doing the opposite! You’re dishonest, darling! Very dishonest! Your actions betray your words!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was speechless.</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room could clearly see his expression.</p>
<p><em>[Damn it. It’s time for Wansheng to go bankrupt!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Shall we just cancel Du Jingya?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen: Someone is always trying to land me in trouble!]</em></p>
<p>The average number of viewers in the live broadcast room had almost doubled since the previous day.</p>
<p>Finally, the recording for the first season of ‘Welcome to My Home’ finished in floods of laughter.</p>
<p>No matter what challenge director Zhao Yu came up with, Shen Yichong always managed to earn enough family funds.</p>
<p>Little Bun and Yu Yaoyao’s food cravings were always satisfied, and Wei Ming and Lu Cheng had a miserable time doing all the chores.</p>
<p>The guests bid farewell under the happy atmosphere, while Shen Yichong and his family moved to a comfortable stay near the recording site. This was so that Yu Yaoyao could have a rest while they waited for the recording of the second season to start.</p>
<p>During the hot summer vacation season ‘Allure’ was finally released!</p>
<p>The fantasy novel was ranked in the top ten sales and had a large number of readers and fans. However, just as Shen Yichong had expected, the online feedback was extremely poor.</p>
<p>Wansheng and Chen Qiao already didn’t have high expectations after they’d received so much criticism from the trailer. Their was hope was that they could break-even. But in a total turnaround from their original expectations, the box office for the premiere reached over 100 million on the first day.</p>
<p>If the trend continued like this, the box office in the first week was likely to exceed 1 billion. That could only mean that total box office would be profitable.</p>
<p>The results exceeded their expectations.</p>
<p>Wansheng thought that the audience would still pay to watch the movie even after they’d criticized it.</p>
<p>“They’re fans. These people will pay to watch it even if they criticize it. In addition, the novel has a large fanbase. There’ll always be loyal fans among this big group! Since the early word of mouth plan did not go as planned, we should take the initiative to produce some spoof videos. It would probably make everyone more interested,” someone from the Wansheng Marketing Department suggested.</p>
<p>Everyone was hopeful after the premiere, and they all agreed to the suggestion. On the same day, Wansheng’s marketing department created a few hot topics with the help of the Internet ghostwriters.</p>
<p>It was actually a story about a ‘nobody’ who struggled before he succeeded in leveling up his life. When the protagonist later became a god, he raised a god-level flame lion as a pet.</p>
<p>The hot searches were mainly to mock two points. One was the plain costume design of the protagonist that had him fading into the background, while the second was the special effects pet lion that somehow looked like a kitten.</p>
<p>“Such innocuous mocking might even be cute. I predict that these hot searches will probably arouse the curiosity of many, which in turn will make them want to watch the movie.”</p>
<p>Wansheng gained its confidence once again.</p>
