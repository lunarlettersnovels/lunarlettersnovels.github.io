<p><strong>Chapter 463</strong></p>
<p>“Is it tasty?” The staff asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes! Super tasty!” The lucky fan answered.</p>
<p>“Better than restaurant food?”</p>
<p>“Of course! It’s made by Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>“Even the rice itself is already amazing!”</p>
<p>The audience who were interviewed by the staff kept praising the food. Many of them were lucky fans of YY. Having eaten the food prepared by their own idol, all sense of judgement was momentarily suspended. Even if Yu Yaoyao used less oil and salt, or the food tasted subpar, they would still think that it was a meal made by a fairy.</p>
<p>But beyond that, they felt that Yaoyao was caring, friendly, and considerate of others.</p>
<p>After the interview, even the staff of ‘Welcome to My Home’, including Director Zhao, were a little confused. All she had to do was cook, and she only served ten people a day. Yu Yaoyao’s cooking speed was even very slow because she had to take care and feed Little Sweetheart. Even though orders were made at noon, some people did not receive their takeaway until it was four o’clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>But even so, the customers still insisted that Yaoyao was very thoughtful of them.</p>
<p>“Umm, how did you come to this conclusion?” The staff asked a question.</p>
<p>Director Zhao tasted the dish himsel.  “The taste is a bit bland. Do you really think it’s delicious?” he bluntly said.</p>
<p>Fans who didn’t mind appearing on the screen fluently responded after eating the food.</p>
<p>“Too much grease is bad for your skin, and your body swells if you eat too much salt. Girls have no choice but to regulate their intake. Yaoyao is taking care of us! Not only does she set an example, but she also personally cooks us healthy and nutritious meals. She is so nice!”</p>
<p><em>Healthy and nutritious meal, my a*s… </em>Director Zhao was speechless at the fans’ imagination!</p>
<p>He was not reconciled. He even had the staff ask their opinion on the food delivery, particularly since it was delivered slow.</p>
<p>“That’s because she’s too gentle,” the fan merely replied.</p>
<p>Director Zhao’s eyes widened. He couldn’t fathom how the customer could compliment instead of complain when they received their order late! He looked at the little girl who was speaking in shock.</p>
<p>“Every vegetable was washed so clean by Little Bun… Every piece of tenderloin was gently prepared by Yaoyao… Every takeaway was personally delivered by Mr. Shen… What a gentle family.”</p>
<p>“Our Yaoyao is always too demanding of herself and is too good to us. She must have redone the food, thinking that the food is not delicious. This must be why the deliveries are slow.”</p>
<p>Happiness appeared on the face of the little girl who just ate another mouthful of rice.</p>
<p>Director Zhao was still speechless. His daughter and son were also approaching the age where they would soon idolize stars.</p>
<p>“You’re also too kind,” Director Zhao murmured softly.</p>
<p>However, the phone of the little girl soon rang. After greeting, the little girl switched to a rough manner of speech. She was not gentle at all. Director Zhao and the staff were shocked to witness the difference. But when they looked at the live broadcast room again, they found the comment section was overwhelmed by praises.</p>
<p><strong>[The bowl of tomato and egg soup was so clear that you could even see the bottom of the container! The quality of the water is excellent. The oil floating on the surface is like a blooming golden lotus. Absolute beauty!]</strong></p>
<p><em>‘Are you sure it’s still soup? Can you even drink a blooming golden lotus?!’ </em>Director Zhao’s mouth twitched, flabbergasted.</p>
<p><strong>[This steamed eggplant is like a work of art. Look at the angle of how Yaoyao sliced them! Did you see how it conforms to the principles of mechanics, and how much it looks like an abstract painting? Oh, this is the collision of science and art! I can’t bear to eat it! I’m going to take it home this weekend and show it to my mom and brother!]</strong></p>
<p><em>‘This fan definitely had talent! wasn’t it just an eggplant?! She even wanted to save it for a week? Was she sure that it wouldn’t stink?’</em></p>
<p>[Slices of tenderloin are so tender, my lips felt a maiden’s kiss, juicy between my teeth and slid easily into my throat. The fragrance and the aftertaste linger…]</p>
<p><em>‘Another poet?!’</em></p>
<p>Director Zhao suddenly felt that beyond their delusion, the YY fans were quite talented. Even a randomly selected fan might be able to do better than their program team.</p>
<p>Praises continued to overwhelm the live broadcast room. Although some fans who just entered the room were a little confused at first, they soon joined the other fans that were praising Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s ‘Youth Without Regrets’ once again became a hot topic, as many of the classic lines and emoticons from the movie were used in the comments. After a while, the popularity of the live broadcast rushed to the top of the platform. It even surpassed the peaks of the previous episodes. YY fans were active in the group once again. They were all so excited, as if they were celebrating a festival. They even seemed to have turned a blind eye to the fact that Yu Yaoyao was not very good at cooking.</p>
<p>Director Zhao was both pleased and apprehensive about such a result. Should they still do this for the next episode? Wouldn’t there be a risk of competitors accusing them of paying the audience? That would be unfair!</p>
<p>The live broadcast of the episode of the show soon came to an end. The two rookies who came as guests also won some love at the end, although the audience didn’t know them at first.</p>
<p><strong>[Xiao Doudou was not bad. He helped Little Bun wash the vegetables, and he seemed pretty diligent.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Xiao Huahua also did good. She always kept a distance from Mr. Shen, and she was with Yaoyao most of the time. I like the fact that she didn’t even try to seduce Mr. Shen. Not bad!!]</strong></p>
<p>The judging criteria of the fans and audiences were really simple.</p>
