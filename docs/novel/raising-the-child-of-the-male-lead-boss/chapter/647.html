            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 104 – Take Out Brother</strong></p>
<p>For a moment, Meng Xinran’s face turned red in embarrassment, “Sister Yu, attacking me in anger is futile! I’m only doing this for your good. If you want forgiveness, you <em>must</em> admit your mistake first!” she said.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran then rushed towards her bedroom and bent down to probe the space under Yu Yaoyao’s bed, searching for inconspicuous items.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao was still unfazed, a carefree smile on her face. She walked towards where the grim-looking deputy director stood, with her mobile phone in hand. “Director, can you confirm if the woman in this photo is me?”</p>
<p>The deputy director had caught  whiff of the news of Yu Yaoyao’s scandalous trending search, but before he could see the photos in a hurry, Shen Yichong had clarified the situation promptly. it was only this time, as he took Yu Yaoyao’s mobile phone, that he was able to look at it carefully.</p>
<p>The deputy director quickly frowned.</p>
<p>From the photo, the man and the woman were pictured kissing. However, from the angle, only the scant side profile of the woman’s face, which was similar to Yu Yaoyao’s general facial features, can be seen. But in fact, there’s no hard evidence pointing to her.</p>
<p>The Paparazzi are ruthless with these tactics for the mere act of producing fake buzz to stir public opinion.</p>
<p>The deputy director asked, “Then this cap is…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao laughed. “That was left by the brother who bought me some take out.”</p>
<p>The deputy director was astonished. “Take-out?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my instant noodles.”</p>
<p>“Impossible!” Meng Xinran, who was scurrying about her bedroom, and was about to snoop inside Yu Yaoyao’s bathroom, suddenly turned around. When she heard Yu Yaoyao, her smile became crazed and livid.</p>
<p>She had paid this person to don the same cap, paired with a similar black jacket. Moreover, with Yu Yaoyao’s room located on the second floor, where on earth could he run? Could it be that he climbed down from the windows? Even a stupid person would think twice about that!</p>
<p>“How can he be a delivery man? An average person can’t easily buy such a luxurious cap!” Meng Xinran glared at Yu Yaoyao as if she had become a buffoon.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao merely smiled without saying a word in reply.</p>
<p>Soon, Meng Xinran and several female contestants followed the staff in searching inside her room and even outside. Not to mention a man–there wasn’t even a trace of a man’s footprint!</p>
<p>Finding it suspicious, Meng Xinran rushed towards Yu Yayao’s wardrobe and opened it hastily. As a result of her actions, two small bags from the inside haphazardly stumbling to the ground. She was also able to see that there was nothing inside but her clothes!</p>
<p>“Those were limited edition.” Yu Yaoyao’s eyes momentarily glanced on the fallen goods before she moved to blow the steam from the instant noodles.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s sweet face almost twisted. She picked up the bags from the ground and tenderly wiped it with some paper towels in a clear view of everyone.</p>
<p>“Sister, it’s my fault. I’ve cleaned it for you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s lips lifted in amusement, and she leaned on her right hand. “I don’t like things that have fallen to the ground.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s steps immediately halted, the hand she had stretched out turned stiff.</p>
<p>It was at this time that the female staff also came back, shaking her head at the deputy director. They had found no one else inside and outside the premises, and everyone was a witness to this. The deputy director nodded in relief and smiled apologetically at Yu Yaoyao. “Then, this matter is settled. Let us all go to bed early and see each other on the location tomorrow.”</p>
<p>While everyone was leaving, Meng Xinran still refused to give up. She gritted her teeth and accused, “Elder sister, are you allowing this guy to hide somewhere else? Is he inside the artists’ room? Or did you let him escape over the wall? His cap is here, how on earth did you think you’ll be able to cheat your way out of this?”</p>
<p>“Even if you hide him somewhere in the building, the moment you are caught by the media, you won’t be able to redeem yourself! You’re jumping straight into the <em>Yellow Spring<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup></em>. We have so many contestants who are witnesses here!” Everyone’s footsteps halted again, as soon as they heard this remark.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s cell phone suddenly rang. She looked at Meng Xinran with a smile and raised the screen towards her. “Is this man you are referring to?”</p>
<p>At the moment, the video call on the WeChat application revealed a man with a tattoo on his arm and two menacing piercings on his left ear.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s eyes turned bright, “Yes, that’s him, that’s him! Sister, your lover just called, and you still want to hide him?! He climbed down from the window, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled and pressed the answer button.</p>
<p>A man’s voice—no, his cry, immediately could be heard inside the room. “Goddess! Fairy! I wasn’t able to buy your favorite pudding, but I purchased other flavored puddings instead! Or can I make you another batch of instant noodles? Just please let me go! Please, fairy!”</p>
<p>Everyone was caught in a state of sudden shock and even looked at Yu Yaoyao’s cell phone with disbelief.</p>
<p><em>Is this the same man pictured with Yu Yaoyao on Weibo? The man she’s allegedly hiding inside her room? But… why pudding?”</em></p>
<p>Everyone was confused, but Meng Xinran was even more surprised.</p>
