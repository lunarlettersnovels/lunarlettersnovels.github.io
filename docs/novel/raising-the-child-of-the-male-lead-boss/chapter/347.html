            <p><strong>Chapter 416</strong></p>
<p>Ren Sitong glanced at Yu Yaoyao admiringly. “By the way, when is your due date? Are you almost done preparing all the stuff you need?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao coughed slightly. The first time she saw Little Bun was not when he was born. Regarding giving birth to a baby, the memory in the original owner’s body had gradually faded. She was totally a newbie in this matter; she didn’t know what she should prepare at all.</p>
<p>At this time, Shen Yichong came out with the fruit platter and said, “The due date is in late October. I have contacted the doctor and the confinement center. All is set.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blinked, indicating that she had no idea.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong gave a cut apple to her, “I’ve told you, but you fell asleep,” he said. “Diapers, baby bottles, and clothes are all prepared. As for the crib and stroller, I took out Shen Rui’s and looked at it. They could still be used. I will disinfect and check them when I go back.”</p>
<p>As usual, he was clear about everything.</p>
<p>Little Bun next to him also added, “I’ve also checked the recipes of my sister. I have studied what she can eat as she grows up. Also, I’ll share my toys with her. I’ve picked up the toys she could play with before she turns one. For the ones that we don’t have at home, I’ve added them to the online shopping cart. I’m waiting for dad to pay for them!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao widened her eyes, and she finally squeezed out a sentence, “Well… I will be responsible for combing her hair when that time comes.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong was laughing out loud. “God, your family is so interesting. With the father and son both busy preparing themselves for the baby, you’re just being the same old you. How will the baby have hair for you to comb when she’s just born…”</p>
<p>Even Da Fu, who had always been silent, laughed lightly. “We saw a few very cute sets of little girls’ clothes and shoes and socks when we went to the mall a few days ago. We’ll give them to you after we buy them. Girls will never have too many clothes.”</p>
<p>“Yes! My sister likes ribbons, especially pink ones!” Little Bun said it as if he knew it all.</p>
<p>It was just as if his sister had already told him across Yu Yaoyao’s belly. He was very sure.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed his head, “Are you done with your homework? If you finished today’s homework, go finish tomorrow’s homework.”</p>
<p>His son must be so free because he had too little work! Little Bun still didn’t know his father’s intention. His eyes lit up when he heard this.</p>
<p>“Okay! I’ll finish tomorrow’s homework, and I’ll accompany mommy to the checkup.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong felt even fun when she heard that. When she gave birth to her second child, her son wasn’t even a year old yet. He was still at an age when he was ignorant and unable to take care of himself. But Little Bun was already like a little knight of the family.</p>
<p>“Did our Little Bun accompany your mom to the previous check-ups?” Ren Sitong asked curiously.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Shen Rui affirmed. “My mommy’s afraid of the hospital, so she needs someone to coax her by her side. She’ll cry if she doesn’t get coaxed.”</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you sprouting?” Yu Yaoyao refuted immediately while blushing.</p>
<p>Shen Rui glanced at her and stretched out his hand to touch her belly. “Mommy is not afraid. My sister is!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao snorted and gave him an apple as a reward.</p>
<p>Ren Sitong didn’t know if she should cry or laugh, “Just have your father go. There are so many people in the hospital. Also, Baby Rui, are you afraid of getting the injection yourself?”</p>
<p>Her own son would still cry out loud when he had to get shots.</p>
<p>“I’m….also afraid.” Little Bun nodded with lingering fear after thinking about it for a while. “But daddy can’t handle it alone.”</p>
<p>A shadow cast over his head before he finished speaking. Little Bun jumped up immediately, “I’m going to do my homework!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong watched Little Bun helplessly as he ran to the second floor, “Don’t run. Walk slowly.”</p>
<p>Even Zhao Yu felt that this whole family was cute in doing just anything. The more you understood them, the more you would discover the personality of each of them. Yu Yaoyao had always been carefree, and she became even more dazed after she became pregnant. At home, she was also completely spoiled by Shen Yichong and Little Bun.</p>
<p>After dinner, the women took the children to play and chat, while the men had their own topics. Shen Yichong took Da Fu to discuss investment matters. Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, was asking Ren Sitong whether it hurts, and how much it hurts to give birth to a baby.</p>
<p>“Well, we’re giving birth to babies at a similar age.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong held her little daughter and watched her play with the rope.</p>
<p>“The first child was okay. At that time, I was still young and in good health, but I felt a little unbearable for the second child,” she began. “It is also possible that I’ve stayed home too much after giving birth. Lack of exercise and the fact that I have gotten older made me obviously feel more strenuous. My waist always hurts after giving birth, and it’s still not completely healed until now.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao became a little panicked as she listened. She was afraid of pain.</p>
<p>“What to do, then? Do painkillers help? How about water birth?”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong patted her, “Listen to what the doctor suggests. It depends on your personal physique. Everyone is different. I heard from a few friends that painkilleres good. At least part of the pain is reduced. Of course, there is still a difference from general anesthesia. It’s impossible for it to be completely painless.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyebrows were all furrowed together, panic was written on her face.</p>
<p>On the second day of the prenatal check-up, she personally demonstrated to everyone what it meant to be afraid of the hospital.</p>
