            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 35 – A Snake’s Grievances</strong></p>
<p>“Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today? I’ve told you these five times already! Didn’t you hear me? Or you can’t understand simple instructions?! Did you even read your part properly in the script?”</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth and slowly explained, “An Xin was framed! She didn’t do anything for her to apologize to He Ling! What the hell were you doing, putting on a guilty, scared look on your face?”</p>
<p>Director Li Bo was so livid that he couldn’t stop rambling.</p>
<p>The lines of both actresses were very simple for this scene. After all, He Ling was no longer healthy at that time and after a few lines, she would fall into deep slumber again.</p>
<p>Logically, everyone thought this would be an easy scene to breeze through, unless the inexperienced Yu Yaoyao would make a mistake.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, when everyone was waiting with bated breaths for Yu Yaoyao’s horrendous acting skills, she actually performed excellently. On the contrary, Meng Xinran was the reason the scene kept being retaken.</p>
<p>With Li Bo’s blatant irritability, the atmosphere in the whole set was tense.</p>
<p>“One last time! And this time, stay still!”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran bit her lip. “All right, Director Li. I’ll so it properly this time!”</p>
<p>Director Li Bo obviously appreciated her moments ago, but now he is acting so nasty to her.</p>
<p><em>Yu Yaoyao is the only person to blame! </em></p>
<p>As the madam of a rich husband, she has no shortage of anything! She recently came back to the entertainment circle and had no qualms on competing with other people for spots in play through backhanded methods. Not to mention, she robbed her of the director’s admiration!</p>
<p>Meng Xinran looked at her in abhorrence, but in her despising eyes, there was a trace of fear at the moment.</p>
<p>She knew exactly what she was going to do as stated in the script, but when she came in front of her, she felt a fit of irrational dread. In Yu Yaoyaos’s eyes, she almost thought she saw a bloody mouth of the cold beast coming right at her!</p>
<p>And whenever Meng Xinran thought of this, she shivered.</p>
<p>“Three, two, one. Action!”</p>
<p>The sound of the clapperboard reverberated again.</p>
<p>She lifted her spirits up by biting her lip determindedly and pinching her thigh with her hand.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao lay still on the cot, looking defenseless, her pale face like a delicate doll that had been broken. But soon, the soft look in her eyes changed!</p>
<p>“I curse you. I won’t die!” A cold, angry hoarse voice drifted, as if a demon was crawling out of hell.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran was stunned and in an instant, her teeth trembled together.</p>
<p><em>Pata!</em> Li Bo angrily threw the script on the ground.</p>
<p>“Cut! You read every word clearly before you come back!” He then gestured for someone in the crew, “Screenwriter, let’s change the scene—one with the lead actor!”</p>
<p>“He Ling was out of her mind and in a mild coma, but the emperor did not search for her at all. However, the emperor had a dream that night of He Ling crying to him, grievously asking why he did not come for her. <em>‘What about the deal to spoil her?‘</em> she says. Afterwards, she tells the emperor that someone wanted to hurt her and asks him to avenge her. When he wakes up, he’ll hear the eunuch say that He Ling has passed away.</p>
<p>Roll the curtains for the opposite scene, you got it? After ten minutes we’ll change scene, the others with no part can rest for half an hour! And Wei Ming, put on makeup at once!” Director Li ordered in one breath.</p>
<p>Ni Yi looked at the time and could not help but laugh bitterly.</p>
<p>He just told the boss it would be over soon. But who knew that this little flower wasn’t a reliable actress at all!</p>
<p><em>But my own sister—these five years did you practice secretly at home? </em></p>
<p>Sure enough, when Shen Yichong came to the crew with steamed bun, he saw this new scene being busily filmed.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was currently throwing herself at the arms of the emperor, crying so much that that she almost had trouble breathing.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw this, his face turned green and he immediately covered the eyes of the steamed bun.</p>
<p>Yu Yao threw herself on the emperor, which was in fact, Wei Ming’s chest!</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I agreed to wait for the weather to clear up. This concubine wanted to accompany you to the royal garden to see the new lotus. But I am afraid it is…I broke my word.”</p>
<p>As she said, there was an extremely sad smile on her face, and another glistening tear rolled down from her eye.</p>
<p>As Yu Yaoyao tearfully acted her lines, she was recalling the comments she had written on the script for this particular scene:</p>
<p>Her chicken was robbed by the snake next door, and then—Oh, how horrible! That snake ate her chicken in front of her! The delicious chicken wings, thighs and breast. None was left! It ate it all!</p>
<p>Today, she has no fresh chicken to eat!</p>
<p>Oh! How her heart hurts!</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, why don’t you come and see your concubine for the last time?”</p>
<p><em>Huhuhu! Zookeeper, didn’t you see my chicken being robbed? Didn’t you!?! </em></p>
