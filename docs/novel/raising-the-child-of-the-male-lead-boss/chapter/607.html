            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 145 – Seizing the Director’s Recliner (2)</strong></p>
<p>“That’s it! While the prey was unaware, the predator devoured!” The veteran actor turned to look at Zhou Qiu and laughed heartily, marvelling at the ingenuity with which the scene was performed.</p>
<p>“It’s a little interesting. You are probably number one today.”</p>
<p>Leaning on the recliner, Yu Yaoyao nodded with satisfaction. Today was a day of winning.</p>
<p><em>Number one… fans… couch! </em></p>
<p>She felt that she would’ve to continue to meet this standard in the future. But still, she liked to sit down for now and enjoy her glory.</p>
<p>Standing firmly to the side, Shen Yichong looked on at her brazen behaviour in silence. He had basically given up on educating her on lady-like manners. He realized there was but on recourse here: accept or ignore. He had yet to make up his mind.</p>
<p>After he’d had a word with the chief director, Ni Yi decided to bring Yaoyao out of the set as she’d finished shooting her scenes. It was better to leave sooner for he could already foresee the headline of today’s hot search.</p>
<p><strong>‘Guangxin Entertainment CEO’s Wife Plays Big Cards and Grabs Director’s Seat on Set!”</strong></p>
<p>Lingering on the set would only bring about more unwanted situations, he didn’t know what kind of demands she’d further insist on. However, Yu Yaoyao refused to leave, tightening her grip on the recliner. She had only just won it, she wanted to enjoy it thoroughly.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t go home yet.” She declared, wearing a child-like albeit a stubborn face.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong grew grim, not wanting to give in to her theatrics one bit. His patience was running thin. Since she so wanted to glue to the chair, he decided to take the very thing away from her. Sensing his intentions, Yu Yaoyao held on even tightly. As he tried to wrest her hold, she struggled desperately. When she sensed she was going to lose, she blurted out.</p>
<p>“No, you’ve promised the little bun… to let him come to see me on the set today after his school.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s hand holding her suddenly stiffened. <em>Little bun?</em></p>
<p>He nonchalantly replied, “You can’t talk about that now, it’s too late.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at him with glistened eyes and an innocent face, as if she’s wronged. Anyone looking at her now, would have long melted away.  And yet, Shen Yichong only felt amused, there was a hint of mirth in his eyes. Her antics reminded him of his son… the two were so alike while protesting, cutting a perfect sorry figure. He’d be damned if he’s persuaded!</p>
<p>“Anyway, the director said it was fine. So, I’ll just lay here and wait for my little bun to come.”</p>
<p>She still remembered what her husband said to their son so she played the moral card.</p>
<p>“We can’t break our promise, just like how I promised the little snakes in our house I will be feeding them extra food today, I would definitely do it. Otherwise, they will express their sadness and disappointment. That would make me feel regretful.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. <em>She is really piling up these absurd ideas!</em></p>
<p>“Since they can’t talk, how do you know they want additional meals?” he challenged.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao simply stared at him, speechless.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at her reasonable face that immediately turned into an inflated pufferfish which suddenly made him chuckle. In his smile, the corners of his usual tight lips rose slightly but his elegant taut contours on his face had relaxed and even his dignified eyebrows instantly softened as if they were covered with a layer of warm orange light which turned out to be somewhat gentle.</p>
<p>Ni Yi handed the kettle beside him and shook it completely.</p>
<p><em>The boss smiled… smiled… It is a rare opportunity to see his smile.</em> <em>Is it true that everything has its vanquisher?His elder sister can make such a serious boss laugh!</em></p>
<p>It didn’t take too long for Ni Yi’s condescension as Yu Yaoyao had new demands.</p>
<p>“I seem… a little hungry. I want to drink the director’s delicious tea…”</p>
<p>As the demands landed on after the other, Ni Yi, whose mouth twitched, was soon locked in on the boss’ deadly sight!</p>
<p>“Me, I’ll buy it!”</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>At four in the afternoon, a black car stopped at the entrance of the filming area. As soon as the door opened, a small short leg emerged. Because the leg was not long enough, his little foot couldn’t step on the ground.</p>
<p>People coming out of the front door wanted to come over and help him get down but were rejected by him. Picking up the big white snake plushy in the back seat of the car, he jumped to the ground bravely with a cute little sound.</p>
<p>The little chubby face was a little flushed at the moment, a tinge of sweat even formed at the tip of his nose. He stretched out his hand and took out his handkerchief from the pocket and wiped his sweat carefully. Turning around, facing the door and looking in a mirror, he nodded his head in satisfaction.</p>
<p>He looked up seriously, to the uncle with long legs next to him, and whispered softly.</p>
<p>“Uncle Lin, let’s go…” He extended his little hand to his uncle and let him lead. “…To see Mommy.”</p>
<p>As Chen Lin led him, his heart beat erratically. The expression on the young master’s face was serious and unparalleled. If he didn’t know any better, he’d think he was going to do something big.</p>
<p>“Uncle Lin, what do I need to do later?” Little bun, who had reached halfway from the entrance to the filming of the set of “In the Limelight”, raised his small face in all seriousness.</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve come to visit mommy and I can’t embarrass her,” he said, tightening his grip on the strap of his schoolbag.</p>
<p>He stared down at the big white snake and contemplated whether to hold it or not. After all, sensible and masculine boys weren’t meant to play plush toys, but he was still reluctant to give it to Chen Lin. The tangled expression of the little bun was too obvious and Chen Lin saw the corners of the young master’s mouth twitch.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Chen Lin said with a smile. “Just go say hello to everyone and call them Uncle and Aunt.”</p>
<p>As soon as the little bun heard it, he smiled with relief and hugged the big white snake tightly.</p>
<p>They soon arrived at the filming set. At a glance, the little bun saw his Mommy in the crowd who was leaning on the recliner while lounging. She was sipping on low-calorie milk and munching on small tomatoes as she looked at the screen of her mobile phone. The sight of his mother was enough for a grin to stretch across his face.</p>
<p>The little bun’s tense steps suddenly became light and excited. It was as if all nervousness had immediately disappeared that moment!</p>
<p>“Mommy~ “</p>
<p>Like a small rabbit, he immediately broke free from Chen Lin’s hand and threw himself into his mother’s arms. As soon as he rushed in, he rubbed his small chin on his mommy’s soft shoulder, and grabbed her arm with his small hand.</p>
<p>Surprised, Yu Yaoyao put down the phone and held the little bun’s ass. “Little bun, is class dismissed already?”</p>
<p>“Mmmm~” Some even blushed at the cute sound the little bun made.</p>
<p>The little bun was so happy and answered his mother without lifting his face. He even forgot to say hello to the Uncles and Aunts around!</p>
<p>Indeed, he was so overjoyed upon seeing his mother that everything around him seemed to fade!</p>
