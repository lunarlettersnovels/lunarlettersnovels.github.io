            <p><strong>Chapter 244 – Envy (1)</strong></p>
<p>The makeup artist adjusted Yu Yaoyao’s headwear and touched up her makeup one last time. Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao dozed off. Shen Yichong gave his son a look. Shen Rui, endearingly called Little Bun, looked back at his dad, then at his watch. He pulled the hem of his mom’s dress to wake her. “Mommy, wake up! It’s seven!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes fluttered open. She still looked tired. “Hmm? Are we having breakfast?” she asked in a daze. The makeup artist laughed. Shen Yichong rubbed the bridge of his nose, then put his hands on his wife’s shoulders and gave her a massage, “The director is waiting for you. Sleep after we are done, okay?”</p>
<p>“Ni Yi, give her some porridge,” Shen Yichong indicated to his wife’s assistant. Yu Yaoyao’s stomach protested when she saw the purple rice porridge in Ni Yi’s hands, looking dire. “I am good. I will eat later,” she said.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows, wanting to insist that she eat when the makeup artist rushed and held up Yu Yaoyao, adjusting her dress and smoothing the crinkles. The set coordinator was already calling for Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Ni Yi hurriedly took the coat, along with the small heat lamp and the mug. He went out to check the set. Little Bun peeped outside the makeup room. He wore his mask and put his little hat on. He looked at his father and held his hand out to him, “Daddy, carry.”</p>
<p>He wanted to see his mommy act in that big stage, but there were too many people outside. They would all flock to mommy and he would not be able to see anything! Although it was a little embarrassing to ask his father to carry him, there was no other way.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at his son, and smiled, “Okay.” He carried Little Bun and placed him on his shoulders and waited for a while after Yu Yaoyao walked out. Little Bun waved his legs worriedly around his father’s neck, wanting to go out soon. “Daddy?”</p>
<p>“The stage belongs to your mum, son,” he said, patting Little Bun’s legs, “we shouldn’t take away her spotlight.” Little Bun nodded. He didn’t rush his father anymore.</p>
<p>As expected, cacophony erupted as Yu Yaoyao stepped out. The reporters were competing against the crowd, whipping out their cameras to click pictures. The paparazzi and the tabloids have always spread the gossip that Yu Yaoyao’s success was only because of her rich background and connections, instead of her talent. But tonight, she had broken this chain of bad gossips and proven herself. When Guangxin Entertainment was going downhill, she held it aloft by herself; she rose out of the ashes like a phoenix and put a stop to Guangxin’s decline. Nobody had expected it, neither Shen Yichong nor the fans and reporters. And yet, she did it!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, with Little Bun on his shoulders, followed the makeup artist outside. He looked up at his wife, resplendent in her black embroidered dress. From today, people would stop calling her ‘Madam Shen’ and finally acknowledge her identity as <em>herself</em>, in all her glory. She deserved every respect and admiration thrown her way.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong cocked his head to the side and acknowledged Director Zhou. He grabbed his son’s legs and found a seat around the corner to watch.</p>
<p>“Yu, this scene is of utmost importance for Sheng Ji. Emperor Zhou was assassinated and the rebels have claimed the power. The new emperor wants you to be in his harem. This imperial decree was announced to you by the new queen. You feel humiliated and unsettled, but more than that, you grieve about the loss brought about by the change of dynasties,” Zhou Qiu explained to Yu Yaoyao about the scene and the character she was supposed to play, “For three years, you have been locked up in the palace and haven’t been allowed to step out of it. Day after day, you become unaware with the passage of time, but one day, you wake up and find out that everything in the country has changed; the emperor has changed and your parents are gone. The only thing that was constant was that you weren’t free then and you aren’t free now. You see? The word sadness is an understatement, what you feel is numbness from the pain and you need to show that.”</p>
<p>“So you have lost all hope and you kneel to accept the royal decree. Finally, you walk to the rooftop and jump. Here I want to do a long take, no NG or stunt doubles. Let’s do this in one go!” he continued, “You don’t need to look directly at the camera and I won’t focus on you deliberately, but you will always be a part of the picture. I will keep the filming in this way so that other people will be in the focus as well. It will be chaotic, just like it is in the character’s heart. No matter what happens, your decision will be final and you will walk towards your end without looking back.” Zhaou Qiu looked at Yu Yaoyao expectantly as he finished his explanation about the particular scene. She had been a source of so many surprises, her acting always brought something unique to the picture. He didn’t, even for a moment, believe the accusation and gossips of yesterday’s incident.</p>
<p>“Okay Director. I will give it my best shot!” she assured him.</p>
<p>As soon as Yu Yaoyao went in front of the camera, it was as though she was a different person, full of energy and vigor. There was no trace of the sleepy and tired person who was in the make up room just moments ago.</p>
