            <p><strong>Chapter 471</strong></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye and Ye Yun were both shocked. Among the two best friends, each of them was either high in IQ or EQ. However, none of them could understand what Yu Yaoyao said. Especially Fang Qiuye, who always stayed at home.</p>
<p>She stretched out her trembling hands and grabbed Ye Yun’s arm, “Sister Yun, did I hear it wrong? Did too much coding make me hallucinate? Moreover, did I just hear Yaoyao asked me to be her teacher?”</p>
<p>The corners of Ye Yun’s mouth were twitching. She also found it a little unbelievable. But Yaoyao said it again soon so that everyone could hear it clearly.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was immediately rolling on the floor in her house, unable to speak with excitement! Should she say yes to Yaoyao?</p>
<p>“I-I would love to…but…”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye gritted her teeth. She decided to be honest. Although she wouldn’t mind deceiving anyone, she couldn’t bear to lie to Yaoyao, who had always been such a frank and honest idol. Otherwise, her conscience would haunt her.</p>
<p>When she was just about to make it clear that she was bad at English, the staff intervened.</p>
<p>“Hello, sorry but we’ll have to contact you later. The other fans who called are still waiting, so we have to hang up first.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye snorted. She hadn’t even had the chance to tell the truth.</p>
<p>“Goodbye then~” Yu Yaoyao waved at the camera.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye also said goodbye hesitantly. The call was hung up. She succeeded in getting a takeaway, but she seemed to have landed herself in a big trouble!</p>
<p>“Oh gosh! What should I do, Sister Yun? What should I do?! I really want to meet Yaoyao and eat her cooking, I also want to be her… teacher…”</p>
<p>Towards the end, Fang Qiuye’s voice was getting softer. She hugged the pillow that fell to the ground and rolled to Ye Yun’s side.</p>
<p>“Do you think I can be her teacher with my current English level? Do you think I can make a comeback if I start revisiting advanced grammar books now?”</p>
<p>Ye Yun was speechless. Was this fate, or the so-called ‘fool’s blessing’? Seeing that her only best friend was going crazy, she empathized and felt helpless at the same time.</p>
<p>“I actually think it might be better for you to be honest to Yaoyao, who knows she might still invite you to her house,” she said.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Fang Qiuye stopped rolling. She glanced at Ye Yun with an incredulous look on her face.</p>
<p>“Actually, I’ve already been there…” Ye Yun blurted out.</p>
<p>Her declaration was dropped like a heavy bom on Fang Qiuye.</p>
<p>“What?!” Fang Qiuye exclaimed; her eyes wide as she looked at her best friend.</p>
<p>Ye Yun pursed her lips and smiled, as if she was recalling some wonderful scenes. “Didn’t I text you to tell you that I broke into my idol’s nest?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye breathed a sigh of relief, “I know about this. You said you were accepted into Guangxin. By the way, I have been very busy with drafts lately, and I haven’t gotten the time to catch up with you. I think you mentioned you’re in the Strategy Department?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she touched her forehead and sighed, “What a pity… I know that the Guangxin Strategy Department is mainly responsible for controlling the entire company’s projects and managing the artists. This department is the ‘farthest’ from the artists, and you guys would have basically no contact with them, so as to avoid having bias when making decisions.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun was surprised, “You seem to know it very well?”</p>
<p>She didn’t know about this before entering Guangxin. She only learned about the specific functions and interrelationships of each department after joining the company. After all, entertainment companies were still somewhat different from the ordinary companies.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s face flushed, “I still did some homework.”</p>
<p>A while ago, Fang Qiuye was writing about a story regarding the entertainment industry. Ye Yun thought she must have taken Guangxin as a writing reference.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re right, but I saw the real person, and I went to the boss’s house.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s lamentation for her friend was shattered in an instant. She suddenly turned over and grabbed Ye Yun’s sleeve.</p>
<p>“Who did you meet in person?!” she demanded, shaking Ye Yun. “Chen Lin? Ni Yi? Ah… you must have met Mr. Shen!”</p>
<p>Ye Yun was a manager after all, it was not unusual for her to meet Mr. Shen, her immediate boss.</p>
<p>Ye Yun chuckled. “Even I’ve met him, you know that, right? He delivered food to me last time. Did you watch the live broadcast? There are pictures of my corridor on Weibo,” she broke into a laugh. “He does seem cool, intimidating, and quite charismatic! When I saw him holding my takeaway, I felt like I was meeting my boss.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun sighed, knowing that her experience was considered a rare moment in her life. She then patted the president’s head.</p>
<p>“Sis, I met Yaoyao in-person, and I even met Little Bun. I also drank their tea, went to Yaoyao’s bathroom, and sat on her toilet seat…” she divulged.</p>
<p>Although it was a little shameless, it was still a moment worth bragging.</p>
<p>“I also touched Little Bun’s dinosaur tail. It was so soft.”</p>
<p>She kept it a secret for a long time and couldn’t tell anyone, because she respected Yaoyao’s privacy. The pain of being unable to share her joy with others had really tormented her for a few weeks. Now, she was finally able to tell everything. The president was one step closer to visiting Yaoyao’s house…</p>
<p>Sure enough, sharing her joy made her feel refreshed! Seeing Fang Qiuye’s eyes widen, she felt even more refreshed!</p>
<p>“How is this possible!?” Ye Yun basically screamed. “Did Yaoyao go to the company to see Mr. Shen? Did she bring Little Bun there? No, wait…You went to Yaoyao’s house? Did Mr. Shen take you there!? Do you have such employee benefits if you’re a staff in Guangxin!!?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was simply crazed. If this was the case, then she would quit her coding job and work as a content writer in Guangxin!</p>
<p>Ye Yun smiled and told her the whole story. Facing her best friend who was mad with jealousy, she could only pat her shoulder happily, “If you’re also going this time, then we have a little secret in common.”</p>
