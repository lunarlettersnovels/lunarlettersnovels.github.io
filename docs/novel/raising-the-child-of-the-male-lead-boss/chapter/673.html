            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 78 – A Flawless Narcissist </strong></p>
<p>Soon, the judges gave her their evaluation. Of which, as expected, were only of high praises for her performance.</p>
<p>“For your scene…I don’t think there’s even room for improvement.”</p>
<p>The judge in position c for today was Director Zhou Qiu. “Since it felt very real and was acted in the most natural way, the whole scene made me felt <em>involved</em> in it.”</p>
<p>Next to him was the experienced actor, Shao Qing, who also voiced his agreement, “Full of emotions—the topic was presented clearly. It is the cleanest performance so far for today.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi gasped–this was the best evaluation he had heard today!</p>
<p>Meng Xinran was indeed not a simple girl. Although she was hateful, it was backed with her extraordinary strength!</p>
<p>Ni Yi squeezed his fists anxiously as he watched Meng Xinran get off the stage. He heard the host’s announcement, finally inviting the last contestant, Yu Yaoyao, to come on stage.</p>
<p>As he looked towards the entrance to the stage, Ni Yi ‘s heart almost skipped a beat; on a live, performance stage, sometimes beauty is the biggest and fatal drawback.</p>
<p>Many characters instead of needing attractiveness, are actually too out of step with the characters they are to portray, mainly due to their <em>too </em>bright appearance.</p>
<p>Ni Yi had met several good-looking actors. When they acted as ordinary passers-by, their handsomeness stood out, marking a contrast with the other common roles of those acting as office workers or middle-aged people. This made the scene quite unrealistic.</p>
<p><em>She’s going to act disfigurement. Oh, it’s really a problem to be too beautiful at this time!</em> Ni Yi thought, worry refusing to ebb. And while he was paralyzed in fear, Yu Yaoyao finally <em>carried</em> to the stage, her whole persona still exuding gracefulness.</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s heart was about to burst from his ribcage when he saw this.</p>
<p>Only her side profile was currently facing the audience. At this time, her eyes were closed, and her head was tilted to the side, her long, curly black hair coming down in waves. Her little face looked delicate, the facial features more prominent. A kind of beauty that frightened him too much!</p>
<p>Ni Yi collapsed at once.</p>
<p>Her performance was to play a disfigured person, but she even went on stage in a blaze of beauty!</p>
<p><em>Makeup artists, didn’t you do anything? And why are you carrying her to the stage? Elder sister, this—she fell asleep again?! Did an accident happen?!</em></p>
<p>Ni Yi’s eyes were full of stars, and he suddenly became unstable.</p>
<p><em>This…this…today is going to make the headlines once again, isn’t it? </em></p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao was soon carried to the center of the stage by the staff, the whole scene remained silent, struck dumbfounded. Then, murmurs of derision and heated discussion broke out. Obviously, everyone was shocked with her unusual way of entering the stage—that is being carried bridal style!</p>
<p>But soon, her figure lying on the stage moved. Yu Yaoyao’s lips puckered, her eyes opening hazily from her sleep. As if adding more realism, she stretched out a hand and wiped the saliva from the corner of her mouth, provoking a burst of laughter from the audience.</p>
<p>Then she felt under her head and pulled out a small mirror. She carefully moved as if she was a flawless beauty who had truly just woken up. In the enlarged screen, the expression of the obsession with her appearance was captured very clearly.</p>
<p>As if every day, she was a narcissist.</p>
<p>Left, right, left, right–from every tiny hair on her eyebrow and long, curly eyelashes to her beautiful, clear eyes and pupils…her face was filmed directly filmed by the camera, the back of the mirror facing the audience. However, every tiny movement and tilt of her face at this moment allowed the audience to know which part of her little face she was checking in the mirror.</p>
<p>Her small but tall nose. The ruby, red lips and white teeth–all perfect. She smiled and examined her forehead, the corners of her eyes–no wrinkles. The pores of her cheeks where also nonexistent. She even stretched out a finger and poked at her skin, feeling its elasticity. Only when she felt her soft flesh, did she open her lips with satisfaction–<em>pride</em> and grinned.</p>
<p>Her smile made the audience hold their breath.</p>
<p>She was truly a beauty. But her act of looking at the mirror, clearly portrayed her extreme narcissism, which only made the audience undecided whether they want to cry or laugh in disbelief. Many men at the scene also couldn’t help but fix their eyes on her face.</p>
<p>“Oh, she’s lost.”</p>
<p>The female contestants who were watching around the stage laughed at Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“What’s the use of looking good? She’s just digressing from the topic!”</p>
<p>“She gave up acting a disfigured person. Haha!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi heard it nearby and a black line stretched across his face, but he was unable to refute it.</p>
