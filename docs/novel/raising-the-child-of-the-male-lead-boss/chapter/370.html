<p><strong>Chapter 393</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Having a murderous aura was obviously a very important criteria for a killer character. In addition to having cold, sharp eyes, the audience also had to feel the tension of a killer’s keen sense of violence, showing just how indifferent they were to normal life.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was a mother with a child. She was beautiful, spoiled and had those large, watery eyes. This was the first thing Liang Yujie saw when he looked at her from a distance. Next, was just how delicate and feminine she was.</p>
<p>These were not the characteristics of a killer character!</p>
<p>Liang Yujie decided that when the makeup style was set, her features would have to be hardened so she didn’t look so delicate and beautiful.</p>
<p>“Have you ever killed a chicken?” When Liang Yujie asked this question, he didn’t have much hope for her answer.</p>
<p>Logically, the wife of a rich man would never do such a chore. There would always be someone at home to do something like that.</p>
<p>After confirming that she would be playing the lead role, he had also watched some of her shows, as well as her large and small screen works, and her variety shows. He wanted to have a better understanding of the possibility of her shaping up for the role.</p>
<p>He also watched a cooking episode from ‘Wife’; this woman couldn’t even fry an egg, let alone kill chicken and fish</p>
<p>“You know the character of a killer… It’s all about blood-lust,” Liang Yujie said, frowning deeply in worry.</p>
<p>He flipped through the script as he spoke, wanting to pick a section for her to perform. Suddenly, Liu Yazhi reached out and touched him lightly on the arm.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Liang Yujie looked up at her.</p>
<p>Liu Yazhi pointed towards Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Liang Yujie looked at her immediately. He almost froze in the motion of turning the page. The feel of Yu Yaoyao’s beautiful eyes on him gave him goosebumps all over his body.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was very beautiful, while still managing to look innocent and charming. It also seemed like she could switch between different personalities quite easily. But at this moment, there was no expression on her flawless face. As if Liang Yujie had just called her, the corner of her mouth quirked upwards slightly. Her gaze slowly moved up, as if she was interrupted from taking a sip of her coffee.</p>
<p>The back of Liang Yujie’s neck suddenly went cold. He couldn’t even begin to describe the look in her eyes at that moment.</p>
<p>That gaze was so inhuman…</p>
<p>It felt like he was facing a beast that was threatening his life.</p>
<p>She was looking at him, but it also felt like she wasn’t looking at him, but at prey she wanted to pounce on.</p>
<p>Liang Yujie swallowed heavily.</p>
<p>He wanted to speak, but he seemed to have lost his voice.</p>
<p>All he could do was sit there with his mouth open.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled evilly, and slowly craned her neck in a way that couldn’t be called human.</p>
<p>Her beautiful face seemed to be filled with an expression of cruel horror. While she was smiling, it didn’t reach her eyes, leaving them cold and expressionless.</p>
<p>It looked like she was thinking…</p>
<p>An absurd idea suddenly flashed through Liang Yujie’s mind; it looked like she was thinking about how best to break his neck and end his life.</p>
<p>But it also felt like she was trying to dismember him with her fierce gaze.</p>
<p>A sharp, grating sound rang through the air as she dragged her nails over the coffee table.</p>
<p>Horror gripped Liang Yujie in a way he hadn’t felt before.</p>
<p>“I do have experience killing chickens.” Yu Yaoyao licked the milk foam from her red lips. The motion was neither cute nor charming, but rather filled with the eerie hunger of a beast.</p>
<p>Even Liu Yazhi had chills all over her body. Both Liang Yujie and Liu Yazhi shrank into themselves.</p>
<p>Then Yu Yaoyao relaxed. She cupped her delicate face in one hand, while she held her cup of coffee in the other. Her expression rapidly changed from horrifying to studious and curious. “Director, was what I did the murderousness you were referring to? I have read martial arts novels and watched martial arts dramas!”</p>
<p>Her cold, indifferent aura from just now was totally gone. It was like it had never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>Liang Yujie was relieved!</p>
<p>When he finally came back to his senses, he realized that he had been so nervous that he had been holding his breath.</p>
<p>“Well… Yes… That was it…” Liang Yujie smiled bitterly. “Teacher Yu, you did better than I thought you would. I still doubted your skills, I…”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Yu Yaoyao waved her hand indifferently, “I haven’t portrayed a killer before. Even I don’t know if I can do it well.”</p>
<p>Liang Yujie wiped the sweat from his forehead with a tissue. Now that he was calm, he felt a rush of excitement he couldn’t restrain. “It’s a little different from the characters you usually play. But that’s normal because you haven’t gotten the specific script yet. I will send it to you later…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, screenwriter Liu interrupted him. “Xiao Yao, your performance just now gave me some new inspiration. I’m going to touch-up some of the characters. You looked like you were close to losing control or like you were on the verge of insanity. I found that very interesting. The personality of a killer was not detailed enough. I have to dig deeper and find out what emotion she feels when killing someone. Director Liang, I will finish these changes within a day and send the latest version to you.” Liu Yazhi’s eyes were shining.</p>
<p>Liang Yujie was stunned for a minute before he nodded, “Sure. Also, there’ll be some fighting scenes; but not many. I will need to confirm in advance whether Teacher Yu wants to do them herself?” He handed over the selected script fragments.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao and Ni Yi looked over them together. After a quick discussion, they decided she would have no problem doing them.</p>
<p>“When I was younger, I was the queen of the jungle,” Yu Yaoyao said proudly. “Unless my opponent was bigger, no one could beat me in a fight!”</p>
<p>Everyone glanced at her thin arms and legs, and they all remained silent. They pinched their noses in disbelief at her words.</p>
