            <p><strong>Chapter 498</strong></p>
<p>At the crew, Li Bo was worried about whether the plan for filming would be followed successfully.  He admitted that many of his requirements were relatively strict. But unexpectedly, Yu Yaoyao, who he had not worked with for a long time, broke out like Popeye who ate spinach while she was at the scene.</p>
<p>It may be that it was a long time since she last acted, or she was very eager to go home. Her desire to perform was like a beast that had escaped the cage. Her high spirits impacted the entire crew, and it was unprecedented even for an old director like Li Bo.</p>
<p>The laziness and chillness she had in the crew before had almost disappeared. Director Li Bo even specially prepared a reclining chair for her. But miraculously, she didn’t lie down on it either. Whenever they took a break, she would bring together all the leading actors and group performers like the eldest senior in the crew.</p>
<p>Li Bo was also curious about what she was doing, so he went to eavesdrop. As a result, he was shocked.</p>
<p>“Little Liuzi, Xiao Huihui, Big Brother Dashan… Are you ready for the next scene?”</p>
<p>“You set up a stall on the street, and we bumped into it. Can you show me your expressions here before we start the filming~”</p>
<p>The names she spoke were all group performers.</p>
<p>“No, no, Little Liuzi, your expression is too exaggerated and fake! You can imagine that your wallet fell on the ground, and I kicked it away when you were about to pick it up… Yes, yes, that’s it, remember your emotions now and show them later!”</p>
<p>“Brother Dashan, you are a fruit seller, and you can’t sell them anymore after I kicked it. Imagine that you’ll have no money to eat next month. No meat, no vegetables, only white rice. Does it anger you? Don’t you feel like crying?! Yes, you also want to chase me and demand that I’d pay you back! Remember this feeling!”</p>
<p>Director Li opened his mouth wide. The on-site director can talk about the acting, and so can he. But the next scene wasn’t this one, and it was not their turn to perform in a group.</p>
<p>Did she help him educate the group in advance? No wonder… recently, he felt that these guys were acting better. They could even be like extra characters! Actors who play extra characters have basic acting skills, and they usually take on characters with one or two lines. If they were just ordinary group performers, they would not get any lines.</p>
<p>“Okay, perform well in the scene later!” Yaoyao stressed. Then” “I’ll invite you to dinner if we get no NG. One NG, I’ll invite you to tea. Two NG and above, I’ll invite you to…a whipping session! Now, go, go! Deepen your memory!”</p>
<p>“Okay, Sister Yaoyao!” The crowd answered in unison. Full of spirit!</p>
<p>After Li Bo listened, he also felt that the spirits of these group performers had improved by three grades.</p>
<p>“Next, Brother Lu Cheng!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was not finished yet. She sat on the reclining chair, crossed her legs, and drank a sip of milk tea brought by Shen Rui.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am!”</p>
<p>The one who was named was Lu Cheng, the male lead. He was also an old friend of Yu Yaoyao, although they didn’t have any rivalry in ‘Seven Years’. But he and Wei Ming learned a lot of “script reading” skills from Yu Yaoyao at that time. At this moment, Lu Cheng also came to his senses when he was being called.</p>
<p>“Chief, please instruct!” He saluted Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Li Bo widened his eyes! Good lord! He was not so obedient like this even when he was facing him, who was the director!</p>
<p>“Well, in this scene, we’re going to swap bodies,” she began. “You have already gotten three NGs.” Yu Yaoyao poked her cheek. “You have to show that my soul is already in you… is a beauty like me a burden to act?” she asked</p>
<p>Lu Cheng scratched his head, feeling a little embarrassed. “My crying scene is a bit challenging… I have to cry in a woman’s way… Director Li asked me to have tears in my eyes, but they just wouldn’t fall down, I… it’s so difficult!”</p>
<p>Li Bo also frowned while eavesdropping. This is indeed a huge challenge for Lu Cheng. He was manly, his performance bold and masculine. Indeed, the conversion here was the hard part. He was already prepared for like twenty to thirty NGs for this scene. He would also move the sequence around and wait for Lu Cheng to make preparations if it still wouldn’t work. Li Bo was also helpless. Apart from telling what to do, he could only let Lu Cheng see Yu Yaoyao’s previous shots and imitate her behavior.</p>
<p>However, when he was frowning and thinking hard, Yu Yaoyao hooked her finger at Lu Cheng.</p>
<p>“Brother Lu Cheng, come here,” she said. “I’ll show you something.” As she spoke, she handed over her cell phone. “Scroll through my album yourself. Don’t let me see it. Watch the recent video yourself.”</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao finished speaking, she turned her head sideways, covered her ears, and closed her eyes. Lu Cheng snorted out of curiosity. Then, he bowed his head, scrolled down the album and clicked on the video. Li Bo, who was also holding a teapot, also walked towards his back unconsciously.</p>
<p>As soon as the video started, they were all taken aback. It was Little Sweetheart. She was holding a pink shovel in her hand and was crying pitifully! With her mouth wide open, she cried out loud. Her pure black eyes were like big ponds full of water, and fat, transparent tears fell down.</p>
<p>Outside the camera, Yu Yaoyao seemed to be there. She was softly coaxing her not to cry. Little Sweetheart was slowly stopping her tears, but some of them remained in her big eyes. She also looked towards the camera. After babbling, she called her Mommy again.</p>
<p>“Do you get it now?” she asked. Yu Yaoyao still had her eyes and ears covered. “If it still doesn’t work, watch it a few more times and learn how my Little Sweetheart cried. Crying so much and looking at me pitifully with tears in her eyes… No… I want to cry just thinking about it!”</p>
<p>Little Shen Rui who was next to her immediately patted her shoulder and comforted her in a low voice. But soon, he turned around and said, “Come on, Uncle Lu Cheng! I’ll help Mommy send you the video, so you can study it hard. My little sister is such a crybaby. No matter what kind of cry you need to perform, you can find it in her video and follow along!”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng: “…Ah.”</p>
<p>Li Bo: “…”</p>
<p>After half an hour’s rest, Lu Cheng’s crying scene miraculously passed by without NG!</p>
