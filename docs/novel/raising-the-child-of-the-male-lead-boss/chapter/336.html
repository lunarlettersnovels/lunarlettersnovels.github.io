            <p><strong>Chapter 427</strong></p>
<p>The Little bun was super careful. He didn’t even dare to use any force as he slowly put his face on his mommy’s belly.</p>
<p>As he experienced the uncomfortness during pregnancy with a basketball before, he learned more about the hardship of being a mother. Knowing how uncomfortable and fragile a mother carrying a baby was, he was acting very softly now, always afraid that he would accidentally hurt his younger sister.</p>
<p>“Little cute sister, little beautiful sister?” he began. “Can you hear me talking? Hello, hello?”</p>
<p>He leaned closer and said hello twice as if he was making a phone call. But he didn’t dare to make too much noise. After a while, he looked up in frustration.</p>
<p>“Mommy, it seems that the signal is not very good today.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao touched his head. The closer it was to giving birth, the lesser the baby in the belly was willing to move. The baby was getting bigger and had limited space in her stomach. She no longer moved as much as she did before. It all had to depend on her mood. Unlike before when she would be very happy inside if you touched the belly and interacted with her.</p>
<p>Little Bun Shen Rui had been a little worried about his sister recently. To make him feel relieved, Yu Yaoyao would coax him by saying that the signal might not be good, and his sister sometimes couldn’t hear him. At this moment, Little Bun felt that the signal was bad, which was why his sister had no reaction at all.</p>
<p>“Mommy, I’ll talk to my little sister again when you change your seat.” He took it seriously.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao agreed immediately, “Sure! Let’s go out to the garden to bask in the sun~”</p>
<p>“Hmm, there is no roof over there, the signal will be strong!”</p>
<p>Little Bun immediately took his mommy out happily.</p>
<p>Standing at the top of the stairs, Shen Yichong heard this discussion between the mother and son. He pinched his eyebrows with a headache. His wife and son both loved to talk about nonsense. He would really get a headache when the two stayed together. One would talk nonsense while the other would take it seriously.</p>
<p>He felt another pain in his head imagining that his baby daughter would also learn that from the two. Forget about heading on to the second floor. He went straight down to help Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Looking down at his son, he pursed his lower lip, “Are you done with your homework? Did you play the violin too? What about the painting homework that has to be handed in this week?”</p>
<p>Shen Rui had vigorous energy, and he could no longer be trapped by ordinary <a href="http://homework.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homework.In</a> desperation, Shen Yichong hired a tutor to give him one-on-one tutoring on violin and painting. If he were to attend big classes, it was estimated that he would easily complete the progress. So, a private teacher was needed to assign advanced homework according to his learning progress.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s task for the tutor was to let his son spend at least one hour a day on this matter. This could prevent him butting into the adult world all day long. Sure enough, this trick was pretty useful.</p>
<p>Little Bun Shen Rui puffed his cheeks when he heard it.</p>
<p>“Daddy, it’s only Monday today.”</p>
<p>It meant that this week’s homework had not been done yet.</p>
<p>“You can finish it ahead of time and give the teacher a surprise. You could also prove your excellence through that.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong did not hesitate to fool his son.</p>
<p>He wanted to talk to Yu Yaoyao about their son, since he had reached the age that they should not coax him, otherwise he would take it seriously. However, he wanted their son to be left out between the conversation of the husband and wife. Neither did he want their son to see Yu Yaoyao being educated, so as not to affect her future authority in front of Little Bun.</p>
<p>“Go ahead, finish it earlier, so you can play sooner,” he urged. “You can also let the teacher check in advance to see if there are any problems. Also, if you need to redo it.”</p>
<p>Little Bun looked at him distrustfully.</p>
<p>“Daddy, I’ll do it at night. Now is the time for me to talk to my little sister.”</p>
<p>His daddy was treating him as a fool. His teacher would assign him with new homework if he finished them early. If he finished the weekend homework on Monday, his teacher would definitely assign more next time!</p>
<p>If he were to give the teacher a surprise, the teacher would definitely give him a fright. Little Bun curled his lips and refused to accept hid daddy’s stupid plan.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at Yu Yaoyao, hinting her to take a look at their “good” son. He had completely gone out of control.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao patted his arm cheerfully, “Darling, what homework should he do? Our Ruirui has already learned so much on his own through online classes. Don’t ask him to always study~”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it great that we have time to be in nature and breathe in fresh air? In the future, there’s still a long time where he has to study. After studying, he has to work. After work, he would have already turned old, and he would no longer have the energy to play. Come here, baby. Let’s talk to your sister,” she said, mediating between the two.</p>
<p>Little Bun kept nodding his head.When his mommy ignored him in the past, he could only play by himself, so he kept playing on his tablet. Then, his daddy downloaded a lot of courses for him. He was free that time so he would watch from time to time. After a long time, he also got used to attending the online school every day.</p>
<p>But… looking back now, he thought his father was too treacherous. The children of other families were still enjoying their childhood catching butterflies, just like what his mother said!</p>
<p>He immediately ignored Shen Yichong and continued to talk to his little sister.</p>
<p>After a while, the two of them even came up with new nonsense. Yu Yaoyao looked up baby clothes on the Internet, and she wanted to buy them whenever she saw beautiful ones. Then, Little Bun Shen Rui would show his tablet to his sister across Yu Yaoyao’s belly.</p>
<p>“Little cute sister, do you like this little polka dot skirt?”</p>
<p>“Blue, yellow, white… Which color do you like?”</p>
<p>He listened while talking. After a while, he lifted his sweaty little face with joy, “Mommy, little sister moved. She likes the little white skirt!”</p>
<p>“Okay~Let’s buy that~Add it to the shopping cart!” Yu Yaoyao smiled and wiped the sweat off Little Bun. “There’s also this little wavy gauze skirt, you can ask her what color she likes.”</p>
<p>“Okay, mommy~ Let’s ask together while the signal is clear now!”</p>
