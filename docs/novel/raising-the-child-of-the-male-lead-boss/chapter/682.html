<p>“Dad, hurry up and bring mom in! Mommy will catch a cold and she’ll cough,” the little steamed bun poked at his father desperately.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong forehead creased to a perpetual frown.</p>
<p>Although the woman in his arms is slimy like an octopus, it is true that her current body temperature is somewhat low.</p>
<p>Therefore, he bowed his head and seriously looked at Yu Yaoyao’s pale face.</p>
<p>Her nose was flushed from the cold, the hairs on the back of her swan-like neck erupted in goosebumps, and her small but delicate collarbone was exposed…Meanwhile, her slim waist persistently clung to his lower abdomen, while her smooth and slender legs were almost mostly exposed to the chilly air, without a cloth to cover them.</p>
<p><em>This woman wears too little! </em>His eyebrows tightened once more.</p>
<p>With an effortless sweep of his hands, he lifted her slender body up and turned around, blocking Ni Yi’s view with his broad back.</p>
<p>For a moment, the weight in his arms slightly disturbed him. She was very light—actually lighter than he originally thought.</p>
<p>She clearly did not weigh much, yet she her small body unexpectedly still felt good to hold in his arms; the petite body is extremely soft, a stark contrast against his hard frame. The soft and tender feeling in his hands made him feel quite spellbound and his feet slowed their pace momentarily.</p>
<p>Just after two steps, a clear fragrance drifted from out her body, akin to snow-capped mountains and ice lotus, a refreshing scent. And after a careful sniff, he found that there was an underlying hint of sweet fragrance, enough to confuse him.</p>
<p>“Dad…?”</p>
<p>The little steamed bun stretched out his hand and tugged at his father’s trousers on one side. He was like a small tail, fretfully following behind him. But he was bewildered when he soon found that his father’s pace was getting slower.</p>
<p>Dad’s long legs are actually slower than his own short legs?</p>
<p>“Dad, did you not eat properly today? Do you have trouble holding mommy?”</p>
<p>Thinking about how his father was so lethargic, this made the steamed bun puff up his cheeks in dissatisfaction. When he grows up, he must definitely not be weak like his father, or else he won’t be able to carry his mother properly. So, how would be able to protect his mother?</p>
<p>His son’s childish complaint is like a basin of cold water in winter dumped on his disoriented mind; this naturally suddenly sobered up Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>IN the next moment, the tips of his ears were a bit red and he immediately stepped up his pace and headed for the room on the second floor.</p>
<p>When he reached the big bed, he was about to quickly let go of Yu Yaoyao’s body, by letting her crash into the bed as if he had thrown her into a pool. However, he was hastily stopped by a steamed bun who had rushed over and grabbed his arm at the last minute.</p>
<p>“Dad, you need to slow down! Mommy has a headache and her back is sore.” Like a little man talking to a big child, he repeated, “You need to slow down, okay? Don’t hurt Mommy.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>He looked at the woman peering at him with bright eyes—she was not uncomfortable at all. Her beautiful eyes suddenly slanted, and she lifted her small hand to weakly grab at the corner of his clothes, purposely trying to quake gently.</p>
<p>She then took this opportunity to raise her head and print a strawberry-colored kiss mark on his neck.</p>
<p>“Thank you, dear husband. Your arms are so warm.”</p>
<p>As she lifted her upper body up, the softness of her chest was directly plastered against his chest. Shen Yichong felt shock travel through his spine and his face showed an expression as if he was suffering from bad indigestion.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao saw that his ears were red, and she chuckled and kept silent about it as soon as she saw it.</p>
<p>She turned around and then took the steamed bun Shen Rui’s little hand.</p>
<p>“Also, my little baby deserves a thank you.”</p>
<p>The little steamed bun immediately turned blushed red, and his mouth curved up in a satisfied, small arc. But, at the sight of his mommy lying in bed, his eyes couldn’t help but be full of worry.</p>
<p>“Mommy, what else is wrong with you?”</p>
<p>He squeezed his little buttocks forwards and pushed his stunned dad behind to climb atop the bed. He gingerly touched his mother’s forehead with his small hand solemnly.</p>
<p>“Mommy, it seems you’re a little hot,” he then hurriedly pulled the quilt up to help cover her freezing body. But the steamed bun is still so small. After quite a while of pulling, he was only able to move a little portion of the covers.</p>
<p>Finally, Yu Yaoyao sat up to take off her outer coat by herself and then proceeded to unlock the first button on her blouse, revealing a sneak on the lacy bra within from Shen Yichong’s vantage point.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stood up ramrod straight at the next second and said, “I’m out,” before exiting the room in a hurry.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao grinned cheekily.</p>
<p><em>This married man is actually still so shy, ah?</em></p>
