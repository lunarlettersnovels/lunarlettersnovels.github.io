            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 70 – Helpless Dad</strong></p>
<p>“Dad, where are you going? Help bring in mommy’s meal.” The steamed bun ordered after his disappearing dad.</p>
<p>The small steamed bun naturally didn’t forget the key point for today. He knelt down the of the side of the bed, attending to his mother such as bringing her pajamas, assisting in pulling the quilt, and not forgetting to remind his irresponsible father.</p>
<p>And yes, the main event: fifteen minutes before her mommy had returned home, she ranked first in the program.</p>
<p>For the small steamed bun, this clearly meant his dad lost to their bet!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s retreating back was froze. “Hmm.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui looked at his mom again, forgetting his dad, “Mommy, are you hungry? Oh, no… Uncle Ni won’t let you eat meat. All right, mommy will eat it secretly in the bedroom.”</p>
<p>“Dad,” he looked back to his dad who stood frozen, “Help cover mommy up when she eats.”</p>
<p>The small steamed bun comforted Yu Yaoyao sweetly and Yaoyao also used his small hands to rub her stomach.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao has never enjoyed such a loving treatment.</p>
<p>In her previous life, she had always wandered the world alone, and even when she came of age, she had no partner to grow old with. When she recalled these things, as if enlightenment struck her: there is no one who had cared for her so much as this little steamed bun.</p>
<p>She was momentarily struck at this revelation, her heart brimming with an inexplicable warmth.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong came in with a blank face and a small dining table, he saw the mother and pair son looking at each other affectionately, their eyes slightly red. As if in the next moment that they would hold each other, they were ready to cry bitterly.</p>
<p>His eyebrows naturally twisted at this scene and he hurriedly placed the small dining table on the bed, taking the steamed bun away.</p>
<p>“Dad, you feed Mommy,” his son unexpectedly commanded.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes lit up. <em>Should I play as a patient today?</em> This kind of scene—she has always thought about it!</p>
<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, she cooed, “Husband…ah…” and opened her mouth shyly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a deep breath to calm himself and pressed down his throbbing forehead. But he knew it would be futile to resist, as the little steamed bun was looking at him expectantly.</p>
<p>Finally, he picked up the spoon. He reluctantly scooped up a spoonful of white rice and calmly faced Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Meat! Dad don’t let mommy eat just rice. Add vegetables and a lot of meat! Each spoon should be rich in nutrition. And then, give mommy some soup, so her throat doesn’t dry. And Dad! That spoonful of meat is too big! First cut it to pieces and then feed it to mommy’s small mouth!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt his head was about to explode. “You do it.”</p>
<p>He handed the small bowl to the complaining Shen Rui.</p>
<p>The steamed bun’s mouth curled to a dissatisfied frown. He wouldn’t have let his father do it if he weren’t too small and short-handed.</p>
<p>“Dad, it’s obviously clear that you married to have a wife. Now, what are supposed to do?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was playing bystander, couldn’t stand it anymore and immediately bent over and buried her face in the pillow, laughing until her shoulders shook.</p>
<p>“Look, mommy is crying!” The small steamed looked at his father in condemnation.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>For a sudden moment, he didn’t want to speak to his son!</p>
<p>Soon, he felt that the temperature in the room was a little high. As he fed Yu Yaoyao spoonful after spoonful, the light in his eyes became heavier. Because the opposite party in front of him was looking at him with her shining orbs with a seductive gaze.</p>
<p>“Husband, I can eat another bowl~”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had her chest slightly tilted towards him as she would open her mouth, slowly grazing the spoon on Shen Yichong’s hand with her teeth in an agonizing manner.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, “Stop…or you’ll lose your teeth!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed sadly. However, she was also very satisfied that he had fed her at the very least, so he refrained from embarrassing him anymore. Soon she rolled into a caterpillar on the bed wrapping herself in the quilt.</p>
<p>“I am so happy today~” she said, as she wriggled and rolled on the bed.</p>
<p>She completely released her tired bones and stretched them. The steamed bun was also eager to have a try and wanted to roll in the bed to play with his mother. As a result, his little body was carried away by Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Shen Rui, you haven’t finished your drawing from the kindergarten today,” he reminded. There was also a part of him that thought it is necessary to isolate the mother and child from each other starting from today.</p>
<p>They are not allowed to meet for more than three hours a day, lest his heart will soon be exhausted with anger!</p>
