            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 204 – The Madam of Savings (2)</strong></p>
<p>“That … 800 yuan won’t be enough to pay for all this …”</p>
<p><em>Abalones, sea cucumbers, lobsters – None of these is necessary!</em></p>
<p>“No, no, no!!””</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was shocked when she thought about it.<em> Even if he were a bit better off, his current assets won’t be able to afford such gourmet food, and would only serve as liabilities to pull him back!</em></p>
<p>“We…”</p>
<p>Halfway through the sentence, she paused. She glanced at the beautiful texture and thick meat glazed with fatty streaks in his hand … And swallowed involuntarily.</p>
<p>Even though she wanted to refuse the meat, she couldn’t help but hesitate, reluctant to part with the delicacy.</p>
<p>“Um… Shall we take one steak? Just a small piece…?”</p>
<p>If she ate one mouthful a day, the premium steak would last for three days!!</p>
<p>“Won’t be enough to eat.” Shen Yichong vetoed without thinking twice/hesitation/with no second thought.</p>
<p>Even though their son was very young and thus can’t complete a full plate, as long as it is cut into smaller pieces, he can still stomach more than half a steak.</p>
<p>No need to speak of Yu Yaoyao, this glutton.</p>
<p>If he doesn’t let her eat well, she would babble/nag and accuse/slander him of bullying her incessantly. The (resultant) tears she would shed are usually generous enough to directly wash their dishes afterwards.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Yu Yaoyao hugged the hand with which he held the steak, and firmly shook her head.</p>
<p>“Husband~ Today, let the three of us eat one steak. There are other dishes too – Vegetables, fruits, rice – We should take note of our nutrition requirements. One can’t just eat meat~!”</p>
<p>These were words Shen Yichong had once directed at Yu Yaoyao. His mouth twitched. He glanced at her, then at the cameraman who followed.</p>
<p>“Is this a hidden task?”</p>
<p>A confused Yu Yaoyao: “Huh?”</p>
<p>“Last week, you claimed any human can eat 3 steaks in a single sitting.” Shen Yichong exposed her mercilessly</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao coughed and blushed with difficulty, “Husband, I ate a lot of lunch at the crew this afternoon, so I will be eating less this evening. I’ll take one bite of the steak for a taste- Uh… scratch that, two bites! Just two!”</p>
<p>As she said that, she closed her eyes in pain and turned away in order to not let her cravings linger on the delicious-looking steak!</p>
<p>“You can share the rest of the steak with Little Bun. Since he’s still in his growing stage, he would feel full by three mouthfuls. There will still be a lot left, you can eat the rest of the meat~”</p>
<p>She is the only one in the family who can endure prolonged periods of starvation. At this critical moment, she is the only one who can manage to eat less!</p>
<p>She comforted herself: <em>But hey, it’s still much better than getting to eat merely once a week!</em></p>
<p>She was used to not eating upto a month while hibernating! It was nothing for her! Pei! Simple! Easy-peasy!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong immediately caught Yu Yaoyao’s tragic expression. Though he didn’t get what she was up to; he couldn’t help but feel a little pained for her. He knew her love for eating very well.</p>
<p>Now, for reasons unknown, she is actually restraining herself and is willing to sacrifice her favorite meat in favor of him and his son?</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Shen Yichong narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Yep!” Yu Yaoyao hurriedly pulled him away, fearing he might end up second guessing the longer he remains by the counter.</p>
<p>However, Shen Yichong assumed she was saving money to buy seafood. Unexpectedly, in the end, she picked a big bream for a very cheap price. Even when he walked over to select and weigh some prawns, she cried out and grabbed him.</p>
<p><em>Too expensive, a single catty costs more than 80 yuan! It costs more than 80 yuan a catty!</em></p>
<p>“Husband, you see, these shrimp aren’t a nice catch – Their heads are too big, buying would be too big of a waste!”</p>
<p><em>Shrimp heads can’t be eaten, ah!</em></p>
<p>Had she been a snake, she could still have gulped the carcass and digested it somehow. The human body, on the other hand, is useless in that aspect!</p>
<p>Can’t be eaten equals having to throw them away, but it was sold based on weight and costs a lot of money. That would be such a big loss!!</p>
<p>Bream in comparison is very good! It’s cheap, cute and tasty! The bones are very light and don’t add any extra weight!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong narrowed his eyes in doubt, and soon, was dragged away from the seafood section once again.<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/31026629"><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Browse TOC</span> </strong></a>or <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://www.patreon.com/yingyue?fan_landing=true">Become a Patron now!</a></span></p>
