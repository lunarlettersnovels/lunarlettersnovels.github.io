            <p><strong>Chapter 364</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows. “I was not bankrupt.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Yu Yaoyao said and quickly finished reading through the comments.</p>
<p>It seemed that the market was very much looking forward to this movie, since both the male and female lead actors were famous. The movies they’d starred in always got very good results. Not only that, but the director of the movie had also won awards for his work. Coupled with the special effects and Chen Jiao’s additional investment, a bright outcome was foreseen for the release of the movie.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao carefully glanced at Shen Yichong. She knew he just couldn’t let go of the fact that he’d actually gone bankrupt. She slid her arm around his shoulders and pressed a kiss to his cheek. “It’s okay, Darling. You’re making money, you don’t have to be afraid. My movie will also make money for us. If you really did go bankrupt, I’d be able to support you.”</p>
<p>A trace of heat surged through Shen Yichong’s chest. He gave her waist a gentle squeeze to stop her from spiraling into her fantasies. “I am not short on money. Yesterday, I asked Shen Lin to transfer 30 million to your account. Let me know if you need more.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was just about to ask why when a soft, sweet voice said, “Daddy,” Little Bun rolled over, “won’t you go bankrupt if you keep giving 30 million, then another 30 million, and another 30 million? Daddy, are you staying at home lately because you have gone bankrupt from giving Mommy all the money? Why are you staying at home all day and following Mommy everywhere? You don’t even go to work. How shameful!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stared at his son in shock for a moment, then his expression went dark. He grabbed the little boy and easily picked him up. This kid needed a beating!</p>
<p>He couldn’t listen to another word the child said.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next morning, Yu Yaoyao woke up and left Shen Rui sleeping in the bed where he’d been lying next to her. He’d cried so much the previous day when Shen Yichong had spanked him. Her husband had moved too fast for her to stop him.</p>
<p>Shen Rui had cried the whole night. There had been nothing she could do but endure it. Shen Yichong had refused to let her interfere while he was educating the child. But he hadn’t smacked him hard. He hardly ever hit his child, so Shen Rui would cry regardless of whether it actually hurt or not.</p>
<p>Finally, Little Bun had confessed to his faults under Shen Yichong’s stern expression. He said that he would not interrupt his parents’ conversations, and he would no longer talk nonsense that he knew nothing of. Only then had he allowed the child to plunge into Yu Yaoyao’s arms.</p>
<p>Little Bun cherished that moment. He held Yu Yaoyao’s hand all night and refused to let it go. He finally stopped crying and went to sleep with the help of her repetitive, soft comforting.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao was having a dilemma of her own since she had to join the crew that day. She didn’t want to wake Little Bun because he’d try and follow her to set, but she knew he would cry if he didn’t get to see her when he woke up.</p>
<p>In the end, Shen Yichong wrapped the sleeping Little Bun in a coat, picked him up and followed Yu Yaoyao to the nanny car.</p>
<p>“Something would have happened sooner or later if he kept being this naughty. I had to teach him a lesson,” Shen Yichong said.</p>
<p>Last night, Shen Yichong hadn’t been able to defend himself because of their son’s presence. But now that his son was asleep, he could have a frank discussion with Yu Yaoyao about their child’s education.</p>
<p>“It’s alright if he was just roasting me.” Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched as he spoke. “But once he leaves the house, he will meet friends, teachers, fall in love and meet his girlfriend’s parents. He can’t be this lawless as he grows up. If I don’t teach him a lesson now, he will be worse off with others if he carries on like this.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hugged Little Bun when Shen Yichong put him back in her arms, but she knew Shen Yichong was right. “Ok, Darling. I will correct Xiao Ruirui in the future. We can teach him slowly. He is very sensible. He will understand if we speak to him. You should use less violence.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows. Just talking about this gave him a headache. “I barely touched him yesterday. He was already howling and crying, and I’d barely touched his ass! This acting skill…” As he spoke, he looked at Yu Yaoyao with a worried expression on his face.</p>
<p>He acted just like his mother! Their tears could come and go whenever they wanted.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blushed when he looked at her.</p>
<p>She was afraid that Little Bun would be bullied by the others, so she told him to cry when someone harassed him, especially if that person was stronger than he was. This would force his assailant to let their guard down when they saw how pitiful he was. And another advantage was that it would give a clear signal to those around him that he needed help.</p>
<p>In short, he needed to do whatever he could to make himself look pitiful.</p>
<p>And yes… She’d taught him to do that.</p>
<p>She pressed her red lips together tightly. Shen Yichong must not know about this! If he knew, she had no doubt he would beat her ass as well.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they quickly arrived at their destination.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately breathed a sigh of relief and handed Little Bun, who was sleeping soundly in her arms, to Shen Yichong. “I’m going to work, Darling. I’m leaving our baby in your care.”</p>
<p>But as soon as she pushed the car door open and looked up, she saw a proud, slender figure standing not too far away. She immediately pulled her foot back into the car again. “Darling, Darling!” she said in shock, turning to Shen Yichong. “Freaking gangster Chen has come to the crew again!”</p>
<p>Was this guy really coming to cause a scene?</p>
