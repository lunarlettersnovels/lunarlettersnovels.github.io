            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 112 – How He Cares (1)</strong></p>
<p>The little bun beside her seemed to hear his mommy’s voice, and his little head slowly slid towards her ch*st for warmth. When Shen Yichong saw the little bun’s face, he quickly took the serpent plushie and placed it between them!</p>
<p>The little bunny frowned in his sleep. As his small hands reached out towards the doll, he rubbed his face against the plushie and smelling his mother’s scent around, continued to sleep in peace. Meanwhile, Shen Yichong’s face was a little dark, as he looked at the plushie separating the woman from her son’s touch.</p>
<p>When he got up, he opened the wardrobe and took out a piece of sleepwear. He lifted the quilt and he pulled up the woman who was being so tactless even in her sleep.</p>
<p>“Put the clothes on.” He didn’t open his eyes, and his voice was somewhat a bit lost.</p>
<p>But when his long fingers touched her, it felt like he was touching a mass of soft and creamy tofu. He trembled at this touch, the pajamas falling to the ground.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smacked her mouth and twisted her narrow waist with an instinct to look for warmth nearby. She did not hesitate to seize the hot, towering man near her… Her white arms immediately wrapped around his chest, her slender legs finding their own victim around his waist.</p>
<p>She was resilient! No matter what posture, no matter where she is—may it be dreamland or the waking world, she tightly holds the prey close to her!</p>
<p>The temperature in the room immediately increased by several degrees. Only a dim bedside lamp was on, reflecting the distinct skin color between the two of them. It was a clash of a snow mountain against a towering skyscraper… In the quiet atmosphere, the man’s breathing suddenly became urgent and hot.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong gritted his teeth, as hot sweat dripped from his forehead.</p>
<p>But when he saw his sleeping son, he picked up the woman wrapped around his waist directly from the bed.</p>
<p>“Eat meat… I just want to eat some meat…” Her delicate voice drifted, soft as cotton wool.</p>
<p>“Shut up.” Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched as he scowled.</p>
<p>He sat on the side of the bed, black-faced as he bent down to pick up the pajamas on the ground. He raised the two octopus hands stuck around his chest and stuffed the nightgown through her head. This pajama was actually his shirt and reached Yu Yaoyao’s th*ghs like a regular nightgown.</p>
<p>After pulling the clothes on, he pushed her back into the bed and covered her with the covers.</p>
<p>After some thinking, he paused again and picked up the hotel pillow on the other side, stuffing it between his son and her to separate the distance between them. After squinting for a while, his complexion became better as he turned back to lie down on the sofa.</p>
<p>But soon, his phone vibrated.</p>
<p>[‘In the Limelight’ has just posted an update.] Ten o’clock is the program’s scheduled time.</p>
<p>As soon as he opened it, he found an eye-catching title.</p>
<p><em><strong>— A disfigured Yu Yaoyao! </strong></em></p>
<p>He stared at the woman on the bed.</p>
<p>Finally, he stood up and took the headphones inside his windbreaker pocket, and plugged it to his cell phone.</p>
<p>He opened the video to watch the show. Soon after, he saw Yu Yaoyao as Meng Xinran twisted the sequence of number selection of the first contestant to the last. This program has been done well, and even the editing team helped beautify the process Meng Xinran had done as if she was kind.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong looked at it for a moment, his eyebrows furrowing the next second.</p>
<p>Standing up, he walked out of the room with a cold face and knocked on the other bedroom door. “Ni Yi, come out.”</p>
<p>Just as the door was opened by the clueless manager, Shen Yichong continued, “She was bullied, were you not at the scene?”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi who was about to take a shower was suddenly frozen under the cold eyes of the boss Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong walked into the standard room; it appeared to have the same layout as a large double-bed room, but the area was smaller.</p>
<p>Chen Lin, who had just finished washing and was now donning some pajamas felt embarrassed. Ni Yi, on the other hand, shed cold sweat even more.</p>
<p>“You didn’t know? Didn’t you accompany her at the shooting?” Shen Yichong’s tone was quite unpleasant.</p>
<p>The first stage was a live competition, therefore he was able to watch the footage at home. However, the second match was recorded beforehand, and he didn’t get the clip to watch it in advance. He originally thought that with Ni Yi accompanying her, and with her own experience as well, she would be alright.</p>
<p>That even if she didn’t get the top place, she won’t suffer. But that was all shattered when he saw the video…</p>
