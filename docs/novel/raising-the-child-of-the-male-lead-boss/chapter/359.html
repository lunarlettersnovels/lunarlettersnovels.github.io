            <p><strong>Chapter 404</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Someone that the ordinary people couldn’t access on normal days was giving an online lecture, and he was thanking them for their rewards!</p>
<p>What an amazing experience!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at the clock. “Sorry all, I’ve to go out and buy groceries. I will not accept any further questions. Everyone who has already asked a question or sent a reward can send a private message to my Weibo later. I will try to answer each question and give you the award amount,” as he spoke, he glanced at Little Bun, who had already finished writing his essay of praise.</p>
<p>After Little Bun read out his clingy-to-the-extreme essay, they got another wave of rewards. After that, he took his son away from the cameras.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Shen Yichong went to the bedroom and checked on Yu Yaoyao. He left a note for her, telling her that they were going out to buy groceries. If she woke up before they returned, she could eat the washed cherry tomatoes and cucumbers.</p>
<p>The viewers in the live broadcast room were all impressed by his thoughtfulness. Even the investors who had come to watch his live broadcast hadn’t left. Many of them were begging him to let them, ordinary men, live…</p>
<p>It was easy to imagine how upset their wives would be if they saw the content of the live broadcast.</p>
<p>Such a successful and handsome guy was so considerate and gentle with his wife. He even went shopping for groceries and cooked without any complaints.</p>
<p>How then could ordinary men just go home and rest after work without doing any housework?</p>
<p>Even Zhao Yu wasn’t sure if he should laugh or cry in the end.</p>
<p>As early as ‘Wife’, Mr. Shen had already shown that he was a slave to his wife.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t as obvious as it had been today. Now, it was as if the relationship between the couple had moved to the next level. Like a couple madly in love, he did everything without complaining or being asked to.</p>
<p>Of course, Yu Yaoyao’s pregnancy was also a major factor. It made the father-to-be worried and nervous.</p>
<p>Father and son climbed into the car to go and buy the ingredients. Shen Yichong was in charge of driving, while Little Bun sat in the child’s seat, obediently holding the camera for his father.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s expressionless face and stubborn silence made the live broadcast awkward again.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu, who was tagging along, asked him a few questions to help liven up the atmosphere. “Mr. Shen, can you share with the audience your reason for joining this show?” Since Yu Yaoyao was pregnant, they could have requested that the show be postponed. “Teacher Yu had a very tight filming schedule a while ago, I bet she’s still on her resting period?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took only a second to think about this question while he drove. “My son wants to be on the show. His mother wanted to come too.”</p>
<p>The answer was simple and straightforward.</p>
<p>After a pause he added, “Since I promised them, I had to keep my word.”</p>
<p>Little Bun nodded and added to his father’s statement. “My mommy has been a little emotionally sensitive recently. She cries easily and is often unhappy. The director uncle said that’s because she was too immersed in her role. But Mommy said she always remembers the unhappy things that happened before, that’s why she wanted to come out and relax. I wanted to spend more time with Mommy.” As he spoke, he lowered his head shyly, squeezing his belly. “I heard from the brother next door that a bad father will send his child to a boarding elementary school, and the child can only come home one day a week. If that was the case with me, I would have been so miserable.”</p>
<p>Little Bun raised his head, his little face full of sadness. “I want to spend more time with Mommy before I go to elementary school. That’s why I wanted to join the show, so I can spend time helping my mom so she can relax.”</p>
<p>This was the first Shen Yichong was hearing of this. He frowned.</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room were moved by Little Bun’s pitiful appearance. They all wanted to touch, hug, kiss, and reward him with all kinds of gifts!</p>
<p>Zhao Yu also glanced at the child sympathetically before he continued onto the next topic. “Mr. Shen, are you curious as to who our first group of guests is? I can give you some hints. They are two men who eat a lot. They’ll arrive before dinner. You need to prepare meals for at least four or five adults. Your total family funds are now 14 Yuan. It seems like the current funds are insufficient.”</p>
<p>They were only awarded 10 Yuan for every 10 000 viewers. They were also only given 10% of the rewards they received.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at him. Then, he slowly pulled over to the side of the road.</p>
<p>“What now? I don’t have extra money for you; even if you threaten me!” Zhao Yu exclaimed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at him coldly before he took out his own mobile phone and made a call. “Shen Lin, get all the artists from Guangxin who are currently free to prepare a talent show. Send them to me in half an hour and get them to share the live broadcast link for me so their fans can come and support. I’ll reward whoever brings the most traffic with a tailor-made work schedule and an additional 10% commission bonus this year.” He hung up straight after he finished speaking and passed his phone to his son in the back seat of the car. “Shen Rui, show the videos to the audience in the live broadcast room when you receive them.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was speechless.</p>
<p>Guangxin was one of the largest entertainment companies in the industry.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the famous artists in the industry, and the influencers who could generate plenty of traffic, all appeared in Shen Yichong’s live broadcast room to greet the fans and audience. They also each performed their talent.</p>
<p>The number of viewers in the live broadcast room exceeded the threshold of 500 000 for the first time. And this all happened before they reached the market!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong parked the car and triumphantly invited Zhao Yu too step out. “Director, the latest family funds accumulated is 1485 Yuan. Please transfer the money to me via WeChat.”</p>
<p>Director Zhao’s eyes widened in shock.</p>
