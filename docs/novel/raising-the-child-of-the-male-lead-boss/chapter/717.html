            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 34 – Shocking Changes</strong></p>
<p>According to the script, the female number one’s character, An Xin and He Ling should have been good sisters when they first entered the palace. Only after He Ling was spoiled by the emperor, that she suspected that An Xin was jealous of her.</p>
<p>Imperial consort Chen took advantage of their crumbling relationship, to frame An Xin as the culprit behind who planted the poisonous snakes on He Ling’s bed. She wanted to kill two birds with one stone and remove them at the same time.</p>
<p>In this scene, it was He Ling is lying in bed, paralyzed after the venomous snake attack. And also quite resentful of the An Xin who came to visit.</p>
<p>“Act 200, take 13! 3, 2, 1, Action!”</p>
<p>There was a pale face on the bed as the sound of the clapperboard hitting resonated. It was Yu Yaoyao, who reached out an arm with difficulty; green tendons ran down the length of her arm, courtesy to the green makeup by the makeup artist.</p>
<p>She coughed, “An Xin! You! You were clearly never a good person from the start!”</p>
<p>“When I go to hell…everyday I’ll be on the head of your bed pulling your hair as a vicious ghost!” she gasped and trembled, struggling to finish the sentence in its entirety.</p>
<p>After the last word, it was as if she had drained all her remaining strength and collapsed on the bed. Only the pale forefingers and thumbs twitched, hooked to An Xin’s clothes, refusing to let go.</p>
<p>But her eyes were full of immense hatred!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s performance almost made everyone on the set to be completely engrossed on the scene.</p>
<p>The mood of her character was portrayed majestically, the impact just perfect; her acting skills isn’t that of a slag at all!</p>
<p>Director Li Bo who was watching approvingly, did not yell for the scene to stop, and even his eyebrows were raised in excitement. Meanwhile, his right foot struck a rhythm on the ground as he tapped.</p>
<p><em>A good show!</em></p>
<p>However, when the whole audience looked expectantly at An Xin, the fiery symphony seemed to come to an end. Because the lead actress, Meng Xinran, stepped back hurriedly, almost slipping to the ground in a woosh. She grabbed the draperies by the bedside but still fell flat on her face.</p>
<p>“Cut!”</p>
<p>Li Bo smacked his thighs in anger. “What’s the matter? What did you take a step back? Is it written in the script telling you to take a step back? We’ve done this scene thirteen times already, but you still haven’t figured it out yet!”</p>
<p>His voice was so loud that everyone in vicinity could hear him.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran turned red and bit her lip. “I’m sorry, director! I just didn’t stand still. I’ll do it again. I’ll work hard everyone!”</p>
<p>She turned back and bowed to Yu Yaoyao. “Sister Yu, it was my mistake that made you do this scene so many times.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao dismissively waved her hand. “No, it’s because I’m a spoiled mother who hasn’t acted in five years.”</p>
<p>The other girl almost gnashed her teeth hearing this, looking like she was going to bite herself to death, thinking infuriatingly, ‘<em>Why do I need to bow to her!’</em></p>
<p><em>Humans are terrible. </em>Yu Yaoyao could only think as she watched Meng Xinran’s furious face. Why would she mock her for being at home for 5 years when she can’t even act as good as her!</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s expression suddenly changed from red to white, and then when she looked up, her once bright eyes were full of exasperation and shame!</p>
<p>“Again!” Director Li spoke crossly, “For the 14th time. Action!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao who was almost surprised at the impatient sound of the clapperboard, quickly entered the state of her character.</p>
<p>She was struggling to speak her last words, her voice showing her fatigue, nevertheless, the gloom and ferocity in her voice could be clearly felt by everyone!</p>
<p>“I curse you, An Xin, for the rest of your life,” she glared at Meng Xinran with resentment.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Yu Yao’s resentful eyes seem to have turned into a living sword!</p>
<p>“You are not going to die…from old age!”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran only felt her body shake, as if a cold wind had passed through the back of her neck. As if she was being targeted by a ferocious ghost.</p>
<p>With the last word from Yu Yaoyao, the goose bumps on her arm extended throughout her whole body.</p>
<p>“He Ling, I don’t know anything. How could I possibly treat you—”</p>
<p>“Cut!”</p>
<p>As she was in the middle of her lines, Director Li Bo got up, and irately scratched his head with both hands, exasperatedly pulling out some of his hear in the process.</p>
<p>“Meng Xinran, have you read the script or not? Do you even know what An Xin’s role is?”</p>
<p>In the end, he rushed towards the front and scolded the newcomer he used to admire most in front of everyone!</p>
