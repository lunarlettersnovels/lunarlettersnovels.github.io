            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 96 – Heaven and Hell </strong></p>
<p>Chen Jiao stood on one side, as if he had blended into the background, as everyone’s eyes were impressively fixed on her sorrowful face. It was only till Yu Yaoyao bowed to the audience, signaling the end of her performance, did they wake up with a start.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao, a power generator, who stood with the host, initially, completely concealed the other party’s existence. However, at the moment when Yu Yaoyao gave the curtain call, they discovered that her beauty was enough to match Chen Jiao’s power generator.</p>
<p>Even with the recent performance that had just ended, they were focused on her most of the time, subconsciously neglecting Chen Jiao.</p>
<p><em>Is it because she has many lines? Or that she is more radiant? </em>Thinking this, many of the girls in the audience, who originally stared at her in hostility and wished she would disappear from the stage immediately and stay away from their male god Chen Jiao, now found themselves teary-eyed.</p>
<p>“Yes, girls must be strong. Else, how can we chase Chen Jiao! Oh, she’s right! ”</p>
<p>“I instantly sympathize with her. Today’s performance displays her real temperament? My God, I feel as if I’ve wronged her.”</p>
<p>“Women must be strong, otherwise, it would be really difficult to have a harmonious life in marriage living with in laws! My mother-in-law also despises me, ah, I know the feeling.”</p>
<p>“So, at a glance, she is actually miserable. If she does nothing, she is still wronged… and just because she looks good, people would come make trouble!”</p>
<p>The audience became a little noisy immediately, but it was a positive discussion on Yu Yaoyao’s side.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran couldn’t almost believe this spectacle before her eyes that she took a step back.<em> She actually won the support of the film emperor’s fans!? How can this happen?</em></p>
<p>And the murmurs among the judge could also be heard. Zhou Qiu picked up the receiver and sighed, “Yu Yaoyao, I want to ask you a question.”</p>
<p>The scene instantly quieted down.</p>
<p>“Do you have any spare time on your schedule this time? Would you like to star in my new play? ” he asked with a smile.</p>
<p>The colors on Meng Xinran’s face changed again! No! Is that the <em>same</em> play she was aiming for?</p>
<p>Almost every TV series directed by Zhou Qiu was a resounding success, oozing with popularity and in the process raising numerous small flowers like her to stardom. And the reason why she wanted to take part in this variety show is that she wanted to get the second supporting actress role in Zhou Qiu’s next play.</p>
<p>But the appreciation in Zhou Qiu’s eyes at the moment were all for Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“I’ll send the script and the character introduction to your agent at the end of the day. Please think about it,” Zhou Qiu said.</p>
<p>However, the old actor beside him also could not resist and grabbed the microphone. “Wait, I haven’t spoken yet, Zhou Qiu. I also want to ask, do you want to perform in a stage play? I’m an old man who can still talk to some production teams. Such excellent performing skills should be put on a stage drama to add color!”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu snorted grumpily, “We don’t have any conflicts. Don’t rob me.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled when she heard the bickering duo and bowed to them. “Thank you both for your great love. As long as there is a chance for more people to see me, I am willing to give anything a try.”</p>
<p>In combination with her outstanding performance just now, this sentence has moved the audience. It can be seen that she is a positive, hard-working woman! Her earlier defamation must have been the cause of insidious framing of people who wanted to taint her with dirty water!</p>
<p>“This little sister has decided to pay attention to her microblog from now on.”</p>
<p>“I want to become her fan too!”</p>
<p>“Even if she’s standing quietly now, she’s very beautiful.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran almost bit her tongue in fury as she listened to the audience comments praising Yu Yaoyao. Her only wish was that she could rush to the stage and scratch her face. This b*tch fooled her to get the topic she wanted and now stole the favor of the directors and the audience. Even the stupid fans believe her that she was the victim and sympathized with her just because of her acting?</p>
<p><em>B*tch! This shameless b*tch!</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran had calculated for so long, but in the end she had suffered a crushing defeat that made her chest heave and ache with anger. Holding her cell phone, she couldn’t help but open the photograph of two people she had received that day from an anonymous person.</p>
<p>She wants to take back everything she lost!</p>
<p><em>Yu Yaoyao, go to hell!</em></p>
