            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 113 – How He Cares (2)</strong></p>
<p>“If there is a problem, you should immediately communicate with the director group; fight for the rights of the artists under your care. Do you still need me to teach you this?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s voice was hard and businesslike. But even a fool can hear the underlying defensiveness in this statement. As he said that, he picked up the phone and clicked the pause button of the video, planning to oversee every minute of the video.</p>
<p>Ni Yi hurriedly put on a shirt. “Boss Shen, I always wanted to fight, but sister Yu…” Faced with the boss’s frightening expression, he swallowed his saliva.</p>
<p>Especially in the future, when someone spreads a rumor they want to get a divorce, he will be most anxious!</p>
<p>“Sister Yu didn’t give me a chance. She did it all by herself…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s right eyebrow raised questioningly. This prompted Ni Yi to point at the paused video, rubbing his hands. “Sister Yu came first in that round.” He said, with a hint of joy in his face.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, for the third round held today, she also won first place.”</p>
<p>A hint of surprise flashed through Shen Yichong’s dark orbs. His once taciturn, handsome face showed an expression other than gloom for the first time.</p>
<p>But soon, he smashed his lips and reminded Ni Yi, “This will not happen next time. Her ability is one thing, but the responsibility of an agent is another.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi suddenly wanted to sign in relief as he felt the waves of pressure finally release hold over him.</p>
<p>“Yes, boss! I will be stronger next time!”</p>
<p>He watched Shen Yichong, with his usual poker face, leave the room, before he finally sat down on the sofa, sweat all over him.</p>
<p>Chen Lin patted him on the shoulder, “Apparently, someone was bold enough today to harm the madam, which in turn is an indirect attack against the boss. That person doesn’t regard the boss in their eyes, for them to do it again and again. The next time it happens, you can voice your protests and let everyone know that the boss does not jumpstart an artist’s career by connections.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was shocked. <em>Yes, sister debuted using the boss’s connections.</em> <em>But…</em> He looked at Chen Lin and coughed.</p>
<p>In the present, he feels that his elder sister is a capable actress and doesn’t have to rely on connections to rise in the ladder at all!</p>
<p>But he didn’t dare to say this, and just nodded his head to show his determination.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Shen Yichong returned to his room to continue watching the videos under ‘In the Limelight’ program. When it was other people’s scenes, he impatiently dragged the video progress bar with his fingers and fast-forwarded it. But as soon as Yu Yaoyao appeared, he finally restored the speed to normal.</p>
<p>In the dim-lit room, only the cell phone in front of him reflected a flickering light on his still, cold face. His eyebrows twisted at first, but it didn’t take long for them to loosen, and the formerly pressed lips showed a faint smile.</p>
<p><em>She can still sleep peacefully backstage, even when others are plotting against her. This woman’s heart is ferocious. </em>In Shen Yichong’s eyes emerged an amused twinkle.</p>
<p>After the accident where she hit her head, she became somewhat more confident and willful, somewhat conforming to a real madam.</p>
<p>But after a while, her soft voice gently traveled through the earphones and reached his ears.  “Husband, don’t make so much noise… You feed me breakfast too… “<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This unique and sweet voice, as if bewitched, made his bones tingle. In just a few seconds, Shen Yichong’s composure was broken down, and his ears became hot!</p>
<p>In an instant, the initially silent audience burst into a barrage of comments that he was able to see clearly.</p>
<p><strong>[No! This is too much! Isn’t this Yu Yaoyao too assured?! Even when she’s competing, she still has time to sleep!? Not to mention to sleep talk about her husband live?!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The Shen boss must be at home cooking, isn’t he? Hahahaha!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This is the first time I have seen a beautiful woman sleep live! Even if she’s drooling, her beauty is still otherworldly! Ah, I’m so envious!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Imagine a Yu Yaoyao who wakes up the next day: What!? I accidentally talked in my sleep and exposed how my husband is my slave?! Panickedface.JPG.]</strong></p>
<p>Viewers who were lured by Yu Yaoyao’s hot search on Weibo came flocking to watch the video. Especially when they saw how the Shen boss refuted the controversy, they were even more curious. And now seeing Yu Yaoyao talking in her dreams unabashedly about her husband, they were convinced and impressed!</p>
<p><strong>[She is a goddess for sure! She fears nothing!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The Shen boss: I believe my wife will not cheat. She loves me so much to the point she dreams about me in her sleep~]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This is a blow to single ladies.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[She has a rich and powerful family. Moreover, a husband that feeds them. She deserves it.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I decided to become a fan of this fairy from now on!]</strong></p>
<p>The online audience burst into shrieks of envy from their refuges!</p>
<p>As Shen Yichong looked at the comments, his face gradually changed. His black eyes lit up by the screen looked expressionlessly towards the big bed.</p>
<p><em>She has become addicted to food…? </em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled at this ridiculous thought before he shook it away from his head.</p>
