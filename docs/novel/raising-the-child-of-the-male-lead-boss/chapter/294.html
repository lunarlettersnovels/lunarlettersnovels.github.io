            <p><strong>Chapter 469</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao quickly faced the camera and talked about the problems she encountered recently. The previous fan who called her said a bunch of words she couldn’t understand, and she needed Shen Yichong to translate them. It was only after she knew that the fan expressed their excitement for being one of the lucky calls to get through. They also complimented her and thanked her for cooking for them.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao realized how smart her fans and audience were. Everyone could speak better English than her! So, she decided to ask everyone for tips on learning English and to share her troubles with everyone.</p>
<p>“I encountered a problem recently.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s voice was naturally soft and comforting. Even the girls felt envious when they heard it. But what she said now made many people laugh.</p>
<p>“I recently received a lot of compliments from foreign fans on the Internet, saying that I am beautiful, smart and cute, and I am very moved and grateful,” she began. “Unfortunately, I couldn’t understand it. I needed the staff to translate it for me.”</p>
<p>“This makes me feel sad. It was as if someone had put a gem in front of me, and I couldn’t recognize it. So, I decided to study a foreign language well. It so happens that my little Rui was learning English, so I decided to do it with him. This way, he could teach me if I don’t learn as fast.”</p>
<p>It was only then that everyone realized the words on the board were written by Little Bun.</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao finished explaining the reason, she continued her question for Fang Qiuye, “I could understand some basic compliments from my foreign fans after looking up the dictionary and asking people, but I also wish to write a reply letter to a foreign fan.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, she held out her phone and pointed to the English sentences that almost engulfed half of the screen.</p>
<p>“This fan wrote hundreds of words of praise for me, and I also want to do the same,” she said. “So, I want to write a reply for this foreign fan. I’m asking the kind netizens to help me translate. I love you guys, mwah!”</p>
<p>As Fang Qiuye listened to the voice from the microphone, her heart skipped a beat. <em>‘Mwah?’ </em>She clutched her chest and felt like she was dying! Her goddess had just sent her a flying kiss!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ye Yun had already arrived at Fang Qiuye’s house. As soon as she came in, she saw the president in a daze.She was obviously not in her right mind anymore!</p>
<p>“Xiao Ye!” Ye Yun didn’t even have time to take off her shoes. She quickly pinched Fang Qiuye’s hand. “Wake up! What did Yaoyao ask you?”</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s voice quieted a bit at the last sentence. But it was enough to wake Fang Qiuye from her trance. She quickly flashed her a grateful smile and replied to her goddess through the microphone.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye replied with a flying kiss of her own, her face flushed.</p>
<p>Seeing her like this, Ye Yun immediately smacked her forehead helplessly. At the beginning, she only joined the club thinking that the president wouldn’t be as crazy as the younger fans, because she was an adult and had two years of work experience. Later, they both found that each other had the same goal, and their mentality in chasing idols was also similar. This was when she finally agreed to be the vice president.</p>
<p>But Fang Qiuye was totally hopeless now!</p>
<p>Ye Yun shook her head. She was better. Although she met the real Yaoyao and touched Little Bun’s tail, she only lost sleep for one night due to excitement.</p>
<p>“Repeat the question to me,” she demanded, shaking Fang Qiuye’s shoulders. How could she space away at a critical moment?! Her takeaway…</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye finally came back to her senses and heard Yu Yaoyao’s brisk laughter on the other end of the call. Obviously, the other party was amused by her flying kiss.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye got even more excited, “Yaoyao, what do you want to translate? Say it~”</p>
<p>If Yaoyao wanted her to translate a paragraph, let alone a whole book, she would ask for help from her grandparents and even her English teacher. She would do whatever it takes to help Yaoyao realize her dream! After saying this, she immediately switched their call to hands-free, so that Ye Yun could hear the question directly, and she didn’t need to repeat her question.</p>
<p>Then, Fang Qiuye passed Ye Yun a memo pad. Ye Yun similarly took out a notepad herself and prepared to write down the question from Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Looking at the comment section, there were many people who were looking for partners who majored in English, and Fang Qiuye’s brain began to work quickly. Didn’t her mother also introduce her to a university professor when she headed home last Lunar New Year?</p>
<p><em>‘What did that guy major in?’ </em>D*mn it! She forgot to add him on her WeChat! She must quickly find his information now!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye wished she had four hands so they could work together.</p>
<p>Ye Yun smiled lightly. She was confident, and she patted the president on her shoulder. In her last position, she often had to directly communicate with her French boss and customers from America and Europe. She was confident with her English level, and she had no problem reading English articles and business talks.</p>
<p>Although it can’t be compared with real interpreters and translators, she considered herself pretty fluent in English.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Leave it to me,” she said. She gave Fang Qiuye a gesture, asking her not to worry. Easy peasy.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye nodded and finally calmed down, but she still took her notebook and clicked on the Baidu Translate page, just in case.</p>
<p>“Yaoyao, shoot your question please,” she said.  Fang Qiuye gave up writing the question on the paper. She decided to place her hands on the keyboard of her notebook instead. As a coder, she was more confident with keyboards.</p>
