        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 233 – Treatment of A Rival Company (3)</strong></p>
<p>Now, they were deliberately giving them a hard time! They were treating them badly, as if Yu Yaoyao had done something wrong. He couldn’t help but feel angry with every fibre of his body shaking.</p>
<p>A hand landed on his back as if sensing his internal turmoil and supported him. And the next second, Yu Yaoyao’s bright voice sounded.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, Yiyi.” She said, “Some people are indeed very insidious and cunning, love doing tricks behind others. But we are reasonable people, and we follow the contract. On the contract, it didn’t say which studio, and what time.”</p>
<p>She found the key to the problem immediately.</p>
<p>“If we finish early, we can go back and watch handsome guys to wash our eyes from this unpleasantness.”</p>
<p>She was referring to everyone in the scene. She wasn’t afraid of offending anyone, or making anyone unhappy. Director Ji Chang and Excellent Diamond’s marketing director Jia Zijie twitched their mouth at her remark, and no one was looking happy.</p>
<p>She blatantly insulted them!</p>
<p>As soon as she entered the dressing room, Jia Zijie snorted. “She really thinks she’s a big deal!” Other people responded and agreed with him right away.</p>
<p>And as Ni Yi followed Yu Yaoyao to this tiny dressing room, his face became even worse. This place seemed like for extra actors, and there wasn’t even a table with a makeup mirror! With Yu Yaoyao’s current popularity, she shouldn’t deserve such a treatment!</p>
<p>“Sis, wait, the director….”</p>
<p>“Let’s go let’s go, move faster! So many people are waiting for you, what are you still picky about! Or do you really want the director to lose temper? Would seeing everyone aggravated make you happy?”</p>
<p>Assistant Chen Shen looked extremely impatient.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao just sat on the stool, and asked him, “Where’s the makeup artist?”</p>
<p>Chen Shen stopped his move, and turned with a sarcastic sneer, “Mrs. Shen, don’t you have your own makeup artist? Besides we still have many other commercials to film in the studio today, we don’t have enough people for you.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi almost burned with rage, “We just discussed the makeup details yesterday!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Chen Shen nodded, but the irony of his mouth grew even larger, “But things don’t always happen as planned, there are other big shots here, it’s hard for us too. In addition, you were late, the makeup artist saved time for you, but you weren’t here.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was as mad as hell, “You—!!”</p>
<p>“The sponsor only gave us a small amount of funding. This low-cost advertisement might just end up being placed under the subway, and you want a makeup artist to stay with you all day long? You’re asking too much.”</p>
<p>Chen Shen’s face was quite ugly right now.  “Hurry up, don’t just stand there, put on your own makeup, you’re an actress and you can’t  do your own makeup yourself?!”</p>
<p>This was the cruelty of the entertainment business. When you had popularity, hundreds of people, thousands of people, would surround you. But as soon as you fell down, the crew would leave and go kiss other people’s ass!</p>
<p>There were always enough popular celebrities in show business. Yu Yaoyao wasn’t one of the top actresses before anyway. She was treated well before because she was Mrs. Shen. With the power of Guangxin, she was treated as if she were the protagonist.</p>
<p>Now… she was completely back to square one.</p>
<p>Ni Yi choked with rage. If they had treated them like this from the beginning, then he had nothing to say, but now they changed their attitudes clearly because of Chen Jiao! On the contrary to Ni Yi, Yu Yaoyao looked peaceful, and had no rage on her face. She stepped forward, picked up those cosmetics that looked dirty and were about to bottom out.</p>
<p>“These are a little dirty.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi walked out immediately, “Sis, hold on, I’ll go talk to the director again!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stopped him, “Forget it, he talked to you so arrogantly, do you think anything would change now?”</p>
<p>“But….”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao put down the press powder with disgust, and sighed, “Ay, it’s difficult to change from extravagance to frugality. I’m spoiled by Shen Yichong.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi twitched his mouth.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao soon opened her purse and took out the phone, “Anyway, Yiyi, nobody wants me to sponsor cosmetics? Shouldn’t people pay more attention to my beauty?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi felt his head numbed immediately, and knew that Yu Yaoyao was going to do something.</p>
<p>He answered, “Even if we get the business down now, it’s too late. Doing hair and makeup takes at least one hour, and that’s for experts, if it’s….”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded, “Indeed.”</p>
<p>She sat on the stool, held her chin and frowned. She could put up with these cosmetics and this shabby dressing room; these were not the real difficulties. But going in front of the camera with her own makeup technique… It was probably better if she just went barefaced.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, the director said he gives you another hour at most. Otherwise we’ll just cancel it today, and you can come again tomorrow!” The staff that came in told them this in a mocking manner.</p>
<p>As soon as he left, Ni Yi jumped up. “Sis, these people are too terrible! I’ll call the company!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao waved her hand, took out the phone and called, “I’ll tell my husband~”</p>
