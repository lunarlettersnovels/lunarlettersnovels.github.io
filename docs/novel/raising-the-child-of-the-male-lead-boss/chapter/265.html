            <p><strong>Chapter 496</strong></p>
<p>The corners of Director Li’s mouth twitched, and a hint of admiration and appreciation flashed in his eyes, but he was also looking at Shen Yichong’s somewhat disbelieving eyes. Mr. Shen’s temper used to be weird and… sassy?</p>
<p>Was it true that the wealthy young people in reality were all under great pressure to make money, and they were all like this when behind closed doors..? In that case, that script had to be changed. It looked like he had only captured the appearance of the wealthy old men before, but not the essence!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face was already dark while Yu Yaoyao was acting coquettish. Still, he had the bearings of a man who got used to it. After all, in the past two years, he had understood thoroughly what his wife was like. But when he turned his head and saw Director Li’s exaggerated expression, he felt an instant headache.</p>
<p>“Director Li…” he ebgan.</p>
<p>Diretor Li immediately shook his head. “I know, I know, she was just kidding! It’s always like this between husband and wife! Hehehe…” He chuckled nervously. He didn’t give him a chance to explain at all. It was too embarrassing.</p>
<p>Director Li was aware. Looking back now, Shen Yichong always came to pick Yu Yaoyao up before six o’clock when she was on set. He must be really anxious.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m done eating. I’ll take my leave and go back to the room to revise the script,” Director Li said. “I’ll show it to you tomorrow.” Director Li quickly left.</p>
<p>The next day, the revised script for the male protagonist and female protagonist, as well as their interactions, was complete. Blood inside Shen Yichong’s chest was about to burst as soon as he read through it.</p>
<p>“Wow! This is great, Director Li! The male protagonist seems livelier than the previous version~” she said. “Under the poker face, there is such a heart of manipulation!”</p>
<p>Director Li nodded again and again. Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The month-long trip to country T soon came to an end. Yu Yaoyao originally wanted to stay longer, but after drinking a belly of coconut juice and eating all kinds of fruits, she became a little tired of sunshine and sea, so she decided to pack up and go home.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the two variety shows invested by Guangxin were at the early planning stage. The audition for trainees was already launched nationwide, but the specific competition content and selection method were still being planned.</p>
<p>For the cafe project, the staff were also arranging market surveys and making detailed planning. Yu Yaoyao was not interested in bitter drinks like coffee. But this was Ye Yun’s idea, so she was very supportive. Every time when she stayed at home to read the script, a few ideas would pop up in her spare time. But she declined to be a guest on the show.</p>
<p>“Since I can’t sing, I might be misleading people if I were to be a judge. I’ll just look at the young and handsome contestants and be in the cheerleading team~”</p>
<p>“Making coffee? Coffee and I don’t even know each other! I can be responsible for collecting money, but it seems like I won’t be needed either since it’s now a QR code world. Maybe I could help by trying out the dessert?”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu did not expect Yu Yaoyao’s refusal. He thought she liked doing variety shows. But since she didn’t want to, there was no point in forcing her. Fortunately, Yu Yaoyao agreed to be the surprise guest of the show, and she would appear in a few episodes to warm up the scene . This gave Zhao Yu some confidence.</p>
<p>After all, this was the main investment project of Guangxin. She was still very helpful as the proprietress. Not only did she come up with ideas on her own, but she also collaborated with her fans. Because of Big Head and Ye Yun, she had penetrated into the fan group perfectly. She was happily watching the praises from her fans.</p>
<p>In addition, when she was recuperating, she was also studying hard on the script that Director Li was revising every day. For the role setting of a domineering rich man, it was obvious that Director Li’s imagination was not as wild as avid readers like Big Head and herself. While she was reading, she was also discussing with Big Head.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to interpret the feeling of a man and the mannerisms of the rich man, she also imitated the behavior of her husband, Shen Yichong, from time to time. Every day, she would follow Shen Yichong around before he went out and after he came home. The way he sat upright on the sofa, the way he corrected documents at the desk, his expressionless aura when he criticized Chen Lin… And the way he kissed her.</p>
<p>“Darling, wait a minute.” Yu Yaoyao put both hands on his chest, and said: “Move slowly, I didn’t see clearly.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s temple twitched fiercely. He picked her up and tossed her onto the soft big bed!</p>
<p>“Wow, darling… that pose is great! How did you flex your strength? So cool!” she squealed. “Is it with the tendons of your biceps?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt that the world in front of him was suddenly dark. If he had known it earlier, it would be better to let her discontinue work and have their third child instead. This monster was more troublesome than the two young ones combined!</p>
<p>But Yaoyao continued her onslaught.</p>
<p>“Darling, don’t stop~ The next action is also very important~”</p>
<p>“How are you going to tear my clothes off?”</p>
<p>“This gesture, can you show it again? I can’t remember it all at once!”</p>
<p>She turned her head when she was done.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face was dark. He followed her gaze to the side and suddenly felt sick! Next to them was originally an open space with woolen blankets and floor lamps. Who brought the mirror over here!? When he entered the room just now, she kept diverting his attention, which is why he had not noticed it!</p>
<p>“Darling, I’ve worked very hard in order to perform this role well,” she began coyly. “Can you cooperate?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted and looked at the man who remained still and had a dissatisfied look on his face.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stretched out his hand and pressed his forehead, almost squeezing an anguished voice in between breaths with gritted teeth, “Yu. Yao. Yao!”</p>
<p>“Yes, darling?”</p>
<p>“There will be no kissing or contact below the neck in this play! There will be never, and there is no need for it! Even if the plot requires it, I’ll tell Director Li to use a body double for all the intimate scenes!”</p>
<p>“Eh!?”</p>
<p>“Now, move your mirror back to the bathroom!”</p>
<p>“Nawww…”</p>
