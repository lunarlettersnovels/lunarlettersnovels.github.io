            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 11 – Take It Easy Lying Down (2)</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong hugged his son as he almost stumbled. He turned his head and fiercely glared at the shameless woman talking nonsense! And the little bun who had been dejectedly lying his head on his shoulder suddenly lifted his little face in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Because this baby, when I was most at my most helpless, was sent to me by God. He is lovely and kind; smart and beautiful. I never knew there could be such a good child in this world.” Yu Yaoyao affectionately looked at the little bun’s face, staring into his dark eyes with her own eyes full of tenderness and love.</p>
<p>She’s not lying. From the very first glance, she had liked the little bun and decided in her heart to be responsible for him! This decision held extreme feelings, perhaps influenced by the fact that this was the body’s own son; blood could only be thicker than water. And it may also be due to the karma that she has to bear in reincarnation.</p>
<p>“Shen Yichong, you’re only second in my heart.”  She continued. “But you can’t be jealous of your son, can you?”</p>
<p>The little bun’s face suddenly turned another shade of pink. His eyes glanced at her shyly, and then took a careful look at his father. As if truly convinced that he really took his father’s wife!</p>
<p>But then Shen Yichong put a stop to her tirade with his eyes as sharp as a knife, wanting to peel her alive!</p>
<p>“I hope we can break up peacefully. You don’t use the child as an excuse, let alone deceive him.” He said scathingly, “Even if he is still so small, he already has the ability to think.”</p>
<p>The little bun for a moment had joy in his little eyes, but upon hearing his father’s words, he was suddenly stunned. As if struck by the realization, the light in the eyes quickly dimmed down. His little head resumed to lay feebly on his father’s shoulder, and he hid his face to stop looking at Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>As long as he remembered his past memories, he knew how different his mother was from someone else’s mother. While the other children had snuggled up to their mother, he had only a babysitter.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s heart also felt sour.</p>
<p><i>The child lacks memories of a childhood where he is loved and cared for by his mother. And this is a hard truth that cannot be merely changed by words. </i></p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao bit her lower lip and looked at the little bun. “Baby, have you ever heard the story of young birds in the forest leaving their nest to grow up?”</p>
<p>“The shortest is only for twenty days and the longest one goes forty or fifty, long days. Their mothers will be ruthless in driving them away. And after a year or two, the little bird will be driven out of the territory by his own mother so it could start living alone.” She narrated.</p>
<p>The little bun’s eyes were wide at hearing this story for the first time, and he slowly raised his head in rapt attention.</p>
<p>“If the mother birds aren’t stern and refuse to teach their children, they won’t grow up to be independent in the future, and then they will be eaten by other birds, pitifully becoming their prey.”</p>
<p>“Everything a mother does is for the good of her child. When she watches her children leave, the mother’s heart feels a terrible heartache. But in order to let their children grow up, they had to hold back all the pain and tears in their hearts while silently looking at the lonely child’s back as they leave.”</p>
<p>As Yu Yaoyao spoke, she lay down on the pillow and stroked her chest as if in pain. “Ah, the thought of being separated from my lovely baby makes mom feel unable to breathe.”</p>
<p>The little bun suddenly looked at her in a panic! Seeing her lying in bed with a pale face, he was seized with worry. He was currently held in his father’s embrace, unable to move, but instantly, the two small hands tugged at the corners of his father’s clothes, desperately trying to pull him towards his mother!</p>
<p>The cold light in Shen Yichong’s dark eyes was extinguished by his son’s eagerness.</p>
<p>With an indecipherable expression, he followed his son’s eager eyes and walked towards the bedside. He arranged the hospital bed so that Yu Yaoyao could sit close to him.</p>
<p>“The pillow should be higher and rest on my back… yes, there. At the back of the neck.” Yu Yaoyao, who disliked the uncomfortable position, remotely commanded.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
