            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 229 – The Heroine’s Whereabouts (2)</strong></p>
<p>She remembered in the book that the heroine signed with Guangxin initially and then came to Shen Yichong’s life when he lost his wife. With Ling Shuang’s outstanding appearance, and her skills and work she put up in her career, she finally won Shen Yichong’s admiration, and then slowly captured his heart in the end.</p>
<p>“She’s going to Chen Jiao’s company? Not coming to Guangxin?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Yu Yaoyao naturally grabbed the glass of milk in front of her and took a sip to calm her nerves. She took another gulp before she put down the milk. Yu Yaoyao didn’t notice the milk around her lips, for her thoughts were preoccupied by this change in plot of the story.</p>
<p>Certainly, this twist was very likely to happen. After all, she had replaced the original owner of the body, and partially caused changes in the plot along the way. She first broke Meng Xinran, Guangxin’s young actress, and now seemed to have scared away Chen Jiao….</p>
<p>This Ling Shuang was Chen Jiao’s little sister. It was said in the book that she saved him when he was a child, so he had always cherished her. Now that Ling Shuang had graduated from the Film Academy, it made sense that she went to Chen Jiao’s company, instead of Guangxin. But in the book, Ling Shuang didn’t have her first official meeting with Shen Yichong until she was signed by Guangxin. Now it was very possible that she had changed this whole part of the story and postponed their meeting.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao took deep breaths.</p>
<p>What would happen next was too hard to predict now. Figuring out what would happen next became a lot harder. Shen Yichong hadn’t even met with Ling Shuang, so it was impossible for him to like her! As long as she could keep Ling Shuang away from her husband, she need not make any scene!</p>
<p>Yes, she would keep a lookout at all times. And she must also always keep an eye on her husband.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at her face who was deep in thought and couldn’t help but laughed at his wife. He wiped off the milk around her mouth.</p>
<p>“You don’t eat your meals properly.” He told her. “And, why did you ask if I would cheat on you?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pursed her lips, and smiled innocently, “Nothing, honey~ I just thought that this girl is quite pretty, almost about 80 precent of my beauty, and you’re way too wonderful, I was just worried that she would seduce you in the future.” Yu Yaoyao replied.</p>
<p>“I did not think you were the type to lose your control because of someone’s look.”</p>
<p>The first time Shen Yichong and Ling Shuang in the book made love was when Shen Yichong got a fever in the company on a rainy day but insisted on working. He numbed himself with alcohol, and became very dizzy. The heroine, Ling Shuang, happened to come back to the company and ran into him. In the end, they had sex on the desk!</p>
<p>At that time, she was reading this part of the book in her bed smiling and grinning. But now….she didn’t found it funny at all!</p>
<p>Rainy day, company, fever, alcohol, desk—no!</p>
<p>The heroine of this story had to be her! She would not give Ling Shuang even a slight chance to go near her husband! But of course, she had to keep this secret from Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>She stared at Shen Yichong intensely, even her voice was very serious, “Honey, if you lose your control, I’m gonna bite you!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” Yu Yaoyao asked him as she saw him stare at her weirdly.</p>
<p>“If I can’t hold myself back, you…do you think you can still be fully dressed now?” Shen Yichong answered.</p>
<p>What he said was very seductive, and made Yu Yaoyao a bit shy. If anything, she wanted to be naked now…</p>
<p>After the interview last night, the escape from the company full of reporters was not easy. They rushed to reach the car, and tried to evade the paparazzi as much as they could. At the end, they had to make a couple detours in order to go back to the villa. The trip back home was longer than expected and she even fell asleep in the car.</p>
<p>But…when she got up this morning, she found many hickeys on her body. On her neck, her collarbone, even her breasts….</p>
<p>And she could smell a hint of mint. This man must have done something bad to her while she was asleep!</p>
<p>“Honey, do you have alcohol in your office?” Yu Yaoyao asked. “If you do, then please don’t drink it! Promise me, you will not drink when I’m not there. What if a bad woman takes advantage of you when you get drunk, but nobody comes to save you even if you yell?”</p>
