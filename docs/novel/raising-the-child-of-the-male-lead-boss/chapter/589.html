            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 164 – A Laugh Riot (2)</strong></p>
<p>In the end, she was educated by President Shen. Soon, a soft and cute little bun protruded from the back of the sofa, making all netizens giggle and gasp their hearts!</p>
<p><strong>[Where did this cute baby come from?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Aw, his watery eyes, it was like speaking something ~]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The baby’s skin is so white and tender! I want to pinch his cheeks!]</strong></p>
<p>The little bun only showed half of his face, and soon after stepped from behind the sofa. His face was covered with a cat’s face in order to protect the child’s privacy and also to conform with CEO Shen’s request.</p>
<p>Many mothers and women squatting in front of the screen cried out loudly in disappointment.</p>
<p><em>I want to see the whole face of the little bun!</em></p>
<p>This cute little person was holding a big white snake plushie, his sweet charming voice sounded as he talked to his Mommy. Lots of women and girls couldn’t hold themselves and screamed at his cuteness. What’s more endearing was that when Shen Yichong reprimanded his wife and son, both nodded obediently. They looked like a bundle of innocence, rattling their head in a practiced fashion. Full marks to the cameraman for delivering such a perfectly adorable shot.</p>
<p>The love in this family was like a bomb, it’s exploding. But soon after, another unexpected sweet moment appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>‘Dad, sit down here, take out your hand and place it around Mom’s neck. Otherwise, her head will feel sore…’</p>
<p>‘Husband, raise your arm a little bit~’</p>
<p><strong>[Poo poo poo, a honey-sweet laugh!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I’m here to bow down at the cute little baby who just ordered CEO Shen. This is totally unexpected, but guys… President Shen can be as soft as a pillow! ]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I’m so envious of YYY! Beauty, handsome husband, huge family status, she is a winner for life!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Coquettish women are always lucky!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Little bun really has the power to protect his mom!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Such a good son, where can I buy someone like him? I think that that would require a lot of money!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I am in love with the little bun! If he has a Weibo I would definitely follow him!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen: I actually have a son and a daughter, both are hard to discipline! ]</strong></p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng giggled all through the episode. It wasn’t until the last minute, that she lowered her head and realized that she hadn’t finished eating her potato chips. She’d her full attention on the screen leaving the pack almost intact. Although she’d finished watching the three-hour long version of the episode, she still felt that she needed more!</p>
<p>Boss Shen, who looked so alienated from the kid and Mommy who are busy loving each other, was so interesting to watch. Sister Yu, who thought her beauty was goddess-like and was lazy as always, was even funnier at home than she was in the recording studios! There was also this cute and chubby little bun, who always followed his Mommy and was so intimate and passionate towards her that he made all the women in China want to have that kind of sweet little child!</p>
<p><em>Cute, entertaining, and loving. This family is very funny and romantic in their own way! This kind of daily life makes people envious.</em></p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng immediately opened her Weibo account and reposted the broadcast link of the first episode of the show.</p>
<p><strong>[Zhao Xiaomeng V: Sister Yu, I want to be your friend!]</strong></p>
<p>One hour after the premiere, “My Wife and I” was on the hot search and at the speed of light, it rushed to the first place!</p>
<p>Every scene on the episode became a trending hot topic, posts about it were seen on microblogs, Weibo accounts and other social media platforms. Moreover, business marketing industries and public media account owners, who watched the first episode of the show, were the first to write fancy reviews in various publications and gazettes about it.</p>
<p><strong>#What is this out of the ordinary show? You will lose half of your life, if you don’t watch it!#</strong></p>
<p><strong>#You don’t know local tyrants have true love.#</strong></p>
<p><strong>#Hope many years later, you will still love each other the same way you showed it on the episode. Will support the two of you forever!#</strong></p>
<p><strong>#The CEO’s wife always wants to play dirty!#</strong></p>
<p>The first episode of “My wife and I” instantly exceeded the ratings of the first episode of ‘In the Limelight’. Its fiery level was unprecedented.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Far away, one person was extremely furious. Yu Xinjie had just finished reading posts about Yu Yaoyao, her madness almost burst into flames, and her beautiful face was somewhat distorted. But soon she calmed down and turned to her phone which had hundreds of unanswered calls.  She gritted her teeth, opened an airlines website, and booked a ticket for a flight next week.</p>
<p>She was going back! She wanted to see to what extent Yu Yaoyao had changed! She wanted to know how such things had come to be!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>The first episode of the show ‘My Wife and I’ was popular to the point that viewers were requesting for more, and director Zhao Yu took this opportunity for the couple to sign a new contract. After all, Yu Yaoyao was a rising star in need of more exposure. If there were an announcement that this couple’s new episode would be aired in the future, for sure it would further boost the success of ‘My wife and I’.</p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu felt a little uneasy after the contract signing, as Mr. Shen was only forced to do so for his wife’s growth and improvement. He could easily cancel the contract any time soon since he was rich and money was not a big deal for him.</p>
<p>Additionally, after watching the first broadcast of the show, he felt that the couple had a very good relationship. Even though they had been married for five years,  they still showed passionate love just like a newly married couple.</p>
<p>He was not sure whether the family was in the villa right now. As a matter of fact, Mr. Shen and his assistant might be protecting his wife and planning on suspending the recording. But the first episode was a trending topic, so it was really disappointing to not be able to film today.</p>
<p>So director Zhao Yu ordered the production staff to enter the villa. Today, he was determined to film two episodes of Mr. Shen and Yu Yaoyao’s daily life.</p>
<p>It’s weekend and the sun shone  brightly. Yu Yaoyao was lying on a small sofa in the garden,  sunbathing and enjoying a glass of mango tapioca drink. She was bright and glowing, just like the sun. Not a moment later, there came a delivery van and the doorbell rang.</p>
<p>She suddenly jumped from the sofa.</p>
<p>“Yes, husband’s gift is here!”</p>
<p>At those words, Zhao Yu’s eyes instantly lit up.</p>
