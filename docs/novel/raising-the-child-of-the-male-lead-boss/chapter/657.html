            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 94 – Loveless</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who refused the given thirty minutes of preparation time and opted to perform immediately on stage, surprised all of the staff.</p>
<p>“I have no problem with it.” Chen Jiao smiled amiably, his peach blossom eyes flashing its usual charming light.</p>
<p>“Should I start now?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao has already arrived on the stage. She gracefully held her head up high, and for today’s look, a long, light blue dress hugged her curves. Her soft features were highlighted with minimal, peachy makeup as she looked slightly towards the audience. This casual, but very fresh apperabce made her look attractive under the lights and in the onlookers’ eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>This overbearing woman! You only know how to walk—not even memorizing lines? You’re bound to collapse if you rely everything on improvisation!</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran stood under the stage hidden from spectators as she bit her fingernails. She was waiting nervously, with a mixture of crazed excitement for Yu Yaoyao to make a fool of herself.</p>
<p>The moment Chen Jiao walked to the edge of the stage, his hand propped up as he leaped onto the platform, this immediately caused a thunderous scream from the audience. On the other hand, when Yu Yaoyao approached him, the audience switched to a riot of boos.</p>
<p>Many obsessive, diehard fans of Chen Jiao hated women who got close to him. However, under the thought that they would be able to watch the film emperor’s acting skills, they all struggled to simmer their raging hearts down. Soon, someone else went to the stage to direct the scene, making them quiet down.</p>
<p>But their pair of eyes, like fireballs, were all but friendly as they looked at Yu Yaoyao. Implying that even if she is just a bit careless and accidentally initiates physical contact, they would tear her up!</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao seems to be ignorant of this—or rather uncaring of this fact, as she slowly approached Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>The show is on!</p>
<p>Chen Jiao, who was standing on the stage finally looked into her eyes as the cameras start rolling, “Why have you done this?” his handsome face suddenly clouding.</p>
<p>He was obviously playing the role of a husband who has found his wife cheating.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s soft expression on her face, instantly changed following his question. When she looked up, her eyes were filled with disbelief and sadness.</p>
<p>“Husband…even you…don’t believe me?” Her delicate voice shook, yet there was the unmistakable mourning in them, and a little of fear. Her watery orbs trembled, but soon, a glimmer of hope lit inside them.</p>
<p>“Husband, are you kidding me? You don’t believe everything you’ve just read online, do you?” But then, a crushed look of defeat now emerged on her beautiful face.</p>
<p>Most people are not fond of snakes. Even zookeepers are inevitably biased and love other furry animals. But… she can’t choose how she was born, and snakes can’t obviously grow to be furry and have a cute appearance.</p>
<p>What can she do?</p>
<p>Nothing, that is, she can only look at the zookeeper multiple times as he walked towards the red panda with concern, and next to check on the birds with doting eyes. She can only watch the zookeeper treat her indifferently!</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>The light on her face faded away as she wept. “I, I did nothing wrong. Why would you look at me with such apathetic eyes?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao, who was standing in front of her, couldn’t help but be overcome with shock by the painful expression on her face.</p>
<p><em>When did her acting reach such maturity?</em></p>
<p>The change was quick and deep, yet her expressions and tone were all just in place!</p>
<p>But the light in his eyes was only for a moment as he replied back, “You think you didn’t do anything wrong?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao covered her chest with her injured hand, and looked as if she was about to faint from pain on the spot. Her foot wobbly stepped back two steps, as if in any moment she would kiss the ground.</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me? You really don’t believe me?”</p>
<p>What terrible things did she do in the eyes of the zookeeper? Why can’t she be treated with love and care like the little panda next door?</p>
