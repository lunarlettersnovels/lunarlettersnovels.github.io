<p><strong>Chapter 445</strong></p>
<p>Gu Qianqian’s wit amused many viewers in the live broadcast room. They overwhelmed the room with gifts. But they also felt sorry for Little Bun at the same time.</p>
<p>Little Bun, Shen Rui, had always wanted to be on TV with his mommy. But now that he was really on TV, he was sad about his mommy’s absence. Without his mommy there, he watched his tablet obediently by himself, and he hardly had any interaction with the audience anymore. Obviously, he himself was not keen on acting on the camera. Before, he only wanted to be in the lens because he wanted to be with Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>At night, both the father and son interacted with Little Sweetheart over the phone. Although everyone in the live broadcast room could not see clearly, they could still see Yu Yaoyao’s pretty pinkish face, and Little Sweetheart in her arms. The father and son were reading stories and singing nursery rhymes to the little girl.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao held her forehead and listened for a long time before she finally interrupted them, “Little Sweetheart has fallen asleep long ago. You guys should go rest too.”</p>
<p>The father and son were both crestfallen upon hearing that. All the audience in the live broadcast room laughed.</p>
<p>After everyone fell asleep, Shen Yichong finally came to the door of Chen Jiao’s room and knocked on it. Although Chen Jiao hadn’t slept yet, he was also a little surprised that Shen Yichong would take the initiative to come to him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong also didn’t have the plan to stay for a long time. He just leaned on the wall without finding a chair to sit down on. He stretched out a pack of cigarettes and narrowed his dark eyes, “Do you mind?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao made a gesture of agreement, while pulling out a cigarette himself, “Mr. Shen, mind if I borrow your lighter?”</p>
<p>He was an artist with a positive image. Although there were barely any photos of him smoking exposed on the internet, he often smoked in private. The time for filming was always different and staying up late was normal for him. In the early years when he was just a rookie, it was common for him to wait four to five hours just for a scene. He couldn’t have stayed awake without smoking.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t say anything. He simply threw the lighter directly to him. Chen Jiao spaced out as he received it.</p>
<p>Certain pictures of memories from the past seemed to reappear in front of him, all vividly, as if they were from yesterday. To be precise, he learned to smoke for the first time from Shen Yichong. Or he could say, Shen Yichong taught him that personally.</p>
<p>He was only eighteen years old, and that was his second year in the industry. He used to rush to and from the crews every day, but he was willing to pick up just any roles. In the end, when he finally got a role as a supporting actor with a few lines, people said that he only won the favor of the female directors because of his outstanding look.</p>
<p>No one recognized him, and no one thought he could do it. Shen Yichong was the only one that never left him.</p>
<p>When he was said to be the director’s lover, the female director also abandoned him to protect her name. Then, he once again became a group performer and could only pick up supporting roles that people wouldn’t even notice. When he was completely disappointed and wanted to give up, Shen Yichong called him over with a cigarette.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao ignited a fire and lit the cigarette held in his mouth. The faint light reflected in the bottom of his eyes made him lose focus for a moment.</p>
<p>He suddenly realized that he remembered everything from the past so clearly. He thought he had long forgotten all these. But now, he discovered that he even remembered what Shen Yichong said at the time.</p>
<p><em>“Leave If you want to and never come back again.”</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong did not keep him. He didn’t even encourage him. But this sentence from him inspired Chen Jiao to continue staying in the industry that had many unspoken rules. From acting in unknown roles, to supporting roles, to being the male protagonists, and even winning awards and becoming the best actor, up until today…</p>
<p>He was really stubborn back then. When Shen Yichong let him go, he insisted on staying so he could prove to Shen Yichong that he had what it took.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“President Shen, I want to ask a question,” he began unsurely, “Back then, did you not want to keep me or were you just egging me on? I want to know…if I really left back then and left the entertainment industry, would you feel sorry for me, or immediately find a boy to replace me, and… support him by all means?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s face twitched as he said this. Many fans of his, especially Guangxin fans, and YY fans criticized him for having no conscience. He also watched the live broadcast just now. He found that many viewers were pushing Shen Rui to punish him for his ingratitude.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao gritted his teeth. Even if he hated to admit that, he couldn’t help but recognize the reality and think of the past late at night.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was his lucky star. Without Shen Yichong, he wouldn’t be rescued from being looked down upon at school because he was too poor to even afford counseling books. Without Shen Yichong, there would be no him today.</p>
<p>He may have a good appearance, and maybe a little talent for acting, but without Shen Yichong’s efforts to cultivate, give him resources, and even did his best to market him at the time, it would be impossible for him to reach the height of being the best actor. It was even impossible for him to enter the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Many people criticized him for having no conscience. Although he had never responded to it for the past two years, he already had a vague answer in his heart at this moment.</p>
<p>The corners of his mouth twitched slightly, “Of course, you don’t have to answer this if you don’t feel like it.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao took a puff of cigarette. The answer was already here.</p>
<p>“There is nothing I could not say.” Shen Yichong took the cigarette from his mouth and placed it next to the ashtray. “You yourself have become the boss now, that should be very clear.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao suddenly smiled bitterly. Of course, he had set up his own studio and was no longer the pure actor that had high self-esteem from before.</p>
