            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 118 – Water Fairy</strong></p>
<p>Such was a back door privilege. If it were the average contestant that refused to act in the middle of the match, the program team would immediately dissuade them from joining.</p>
<p>Of course, with Yu Yaoyao, it was a different case. The director has to turn a blind eye because of Shen Yichong’s status and the traffic she brought from the scandal yesterday.</p>
<p>And the director was unwilling to give up the publicity she brings. Especially when he discovered yesterday’s new episode was met with numerous responses upon broadcast.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong wanted to nod in reply, finding the director’s response good but Yu Yaoyao held him back.</p>
<p>“No, I’m fine. I’m not afraid.” Her whole face was glowing, only her evident excitement in place; there was even a hint of expectation.</p>
<p>“Director, is this water scene playing like an underwater goddess?”</p>
<p>She remembered many scenes from popular historical dramas of women bathing in bodies of water. If no such scene were present, drowning would another.</p>
<p>Her appearance is most suitable for such tantalizing shot!</p>
<p>While Yu Yaoyao had this in thought, she swallowed her saliva. She could only imagine how beautiful she would be bathing…</p>
<p>“Director, which of these topics after falling…can I pretend to be bathing after? That…like a drama where a guy peeks at a woman…” Her eyes are looked too bright and giddy for work.</p>
<p>The chief director immediately felt stupid. He looked with a wondering gaze towards his assistant and found that he, too, was only staring blankly.</p>
<p><em>What is the relationship between falling into the water, being pushed into the water…and bathing?</em> They both thought.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face became thunderous in an instant, “You listen to what the director wants you to act!”</p>
<p>She also wants to act being peeked at while taking a bath. What was on her mind? And in this weather, of all time, and with so many people around, she still wants to bare her flesh?</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s neck shrank as she felt her tyrannical husband’s gaze almost freezing her to the core. The sense of crisis doubled, but she pursed her red lips and mustered up the courage, pulling on his sleeves like an innocent girl.</p>
<p>“Husband, don’t be mad. I won’t take off my clothes… You’re the only person who will see my body…”</p>
<p>From her vulgar words, Shen Yichong’s blood suddenly rushed to his throat. Meanwhile, the chief director had an embarrassed smile, and he looked at Shen Yichong with an understanding expression boss, “Boss Shen, rest assured that we will make use of angles when shooting a bathing scene, of which will be finalized by the editing team afterward. No one will see a thing…”</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong’s complexion only turned several shades darker. He looked at Yu Yaoyao who was still clinging to his sleeves and felt his chest tighten. The director took his expression as a pervert who likes watching his wife’s body at home.</p>
<p>“Whatever you want.” He squeezed three words through his teeth.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately smiled and bowed to the director. “Then I’ll choose a topic.”</p>
<p>“Well, there are lots of topics to choose from, and every player can act freely in the camera.” The director added, “Only pay attention to the time limit. Because the weather is cold, each player is only given two minutes max in the water.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Yu Yao happily stretched out her arms and brazenly hugged Shen Yichong’s neck, rendering him stunned.</p>
<p>With his head locked in her hold, she placed a red kiss mark in the middle of his lips. Her soft lips like petals held a mildly sweet fragrance, and upon contact, her touch felt like cream cake.</p>
<p>His heart thuds in his chest in shock, and he stood there, frozen for some time.</p>
<p>“Husband, wait for me here and don’t go away. Otherwise, I will be afraid.” Yu Yaoyao rubbed her head against Shen Yichong’s chest.</p>
<p>The hands on either side of Shen Yichong’s body were only stiff and useless. He was unable to make a move, while Yu Yaoyao, like a flying bird, gleefully followed after a stylist to choose her acting clothes. And the group of staff members, including the director, gazed at Shen Yichong with their eyes filled with envy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Soon, Yu Yaoyao finished her makeup and came out looking like a fairy.</p>
<p>She wore an elegant, white and cyan-blue gauze dress, her hair stretched down to her waist in black curls where copper ornaments adorned the top of her head. Her makeup theme for today was peach, and they elegantly drew her eyebrows, highlighting her bewitching eyes with a black liner.</p>
<p>As she walked, she looked like a character straight from an exquisite ink painting.</p>
<p>All the people at the scene couldn’t help but stop in what they were doing, even the players who were preparing for the match looked towards her direction.</p>
