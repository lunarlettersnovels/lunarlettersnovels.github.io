            <p><strong>Chapter 362</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong was handsome, smart, and rich. And she could tell at a glance that he was the kind of man who had been educated by the elite. He was extraordinary. Every time he’d talked with Chen Jiao, he’d been so full of wisdom and knowledge that it had dwarfed Chen Jiao’s.</p>
<p>She had never known that a person could be so charming. He was like the hero of a plot from some movie, garbed in glistening armor as he descended to earth via colorful clouds.</p>
<p>She was obsessed with him. She’d secretly stalked every aspect of him, and liked him silently from the moment she’d seen him. She’d even entertained the thought of asking Chen Jiao to introduce them if she went to university.</p>
<p>Every day throughout her teenage years, she had fantasized that Shen Yichong would someday pursue her and fall in love with her.</p>
<p>But who would have thought that in the end the very woman she’d been impersonating would marry the man she loved? Yu Yaoyao had taken away her perfect man.</p>
<p>Just the thought of this made Ling Shuang cover her face and cry tears of heartache.</p>
<p>She never should have coveted Chen Jiao’s handsomeness, shouldn’t have coveted Yu Xinjie’s pocket money, and she shouldn’t have impersonated Yu Yaoyao. Yu Yaoyao had taken away both her Big Brother Shen and her brother Jiao, all because she had impersonated her.</p>
<p>This was fate’s punishment.</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao and Shen Yichong had gotten married, Ling Shuang had cried for an entire week. And when she had finally managed to stop crying, her heart was repeatedly stabbed when Yu Xinjie kept sending her pictures of that day.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang opened the photo album on her phone now. She scrolled up to the top, to the very first photo of the wedding. Her own face had been edited onto Yu Yaoyao’s body. Shen Yichong was holding her around the waist, looking extremely handsome in his wedding clothes, and she was smiling brightly.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Shen…” Ling Shuang sobbed as she stared at the photo, “Don’t you know how jealous I am of Yu Yaoyao? I want to be with you so desperately… But because I couldn’t control my own desires, I ended up doing so many bad things. It started with Yu Xinjie. I befriended her bad sister and enlisted her help in coaxing Yu Yaoyao to commit suicide so I could have you… I abandoned my morals and values, all because of how much I wanted you,” as she spoke, her tears ran down her cheeks and dripped to the ground.</p>
<p>She knew that her ambitions had failed and that she would never get what she wanted. All her dreams were completely dashed.</p>
<p>“If I had a second chance at this…” Ling Shuang raised her tear-stained face, “I wouldn’t impersonate Yu Yaoyao. I would return Chen Jiao to her. I would return him to her. I only want you! If only Yu Yaoyao would give you back…”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s heart hurt so badly that it was more than a few hours before she was finally able to get up. She picked up her phone and called Guo Li, “I want to terminate the contract.”</p>
<p>She wanted to leave Chen Jiao. She couldn’t let him torture her anymore. What she had done was wrong, but she had been punished enough. She couldn’t afford to let him carry on torturing her and wasting her time.</p>
<p>“It’s up to you,” Guo Li sneered, “Since you have breached the contract, I expect you to have the money ready.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang bit her lips then said, “Give me a few days grace period, just until I find my next company.”</p>
<p>She was beautiful, she knew this. That was something that Yu Yaoyao couldn’t take away. She was sure she could find other entertainment companies that would hire her; she still had value.</p>
<p>She wiped away her tears and walked confidently to the dressing table. But when she looked up in the mirror, she screamed.</p>
<p>When had she picked up this much weight!</p>
<p>She’d spent the past few days crying and hadn’t bothered to look in the mirror. But now… This single glance had completely freaked her out.</p>
<p>On her previously slim waist, that she had always been so proud of, was now a ‘floatation device.’ Her perfectly V-shaped face had lost all its sharp lines. If she looked close enough, she could swear she could even see a double chin.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with my face!” Ling Shuang wailed.</p>
<p>She had originally thought that her swollen face was because of her lack of sleep, due to her hectic day and night filming schedule. She had even thought it might be because of the beating she had gotten. But that should have all disappeared with a few days of rest at home.</p>
<p>But… This wasn’t swollen; it was fat.</p>
<p>Surely that was impossible? It had only been a few days! How could she have gained this much weight in just a few days?</p>
<p>“What were you feeding me? You intentionally did this to me!” she yelled angrily at Guo Li over the phone.</p>
<p>With Chen Jiao ignoring her completely, the food and drinks, mainly vegetable salad, she had been sent recently were brought to her by two bodyguards. She hadn’t thought much of it at first.</p>
<p>Guo Li’s devilish voice came over the phone saying, “I don’t know anything about that. Brother Jiao said you might know though.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s face paled, and she collapsed to the ground in horror.</p>
<p>Hormones!</p>
<p>She used to ask Yu Xinjie to put them in her sister’s meal when she came over for dinner. I caused her to rapidly gain weight. That way she would lose her beauty and viability for commercial shots. And not only this, but she had hoped that Shen Yichong would stop loving her.</p>
<p>This must be Chen Jiao’s doing. He was taking revenge on her with the same methods she had used to try and destroy Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie had betrayed her!</p>
<p>Ling Shuang threw her head back and screamed. She slammed her phone down on the sofa, but then frantically picked it up again. She sent a text to Yu Xinjie’s WeChat, demanding to know what she had told Chen Jiao. She got a sarcastic response to her question:</p>
<p><em>Didn’t you say that we are best friends and that we should share our blessings? Since I’m in hell right now, you should be in hell too! Hahaha!</em></p>
<p>Ling Shuang let her phone slide to the ground where the screen smashed to pieces.</p>
<p>She was ruined.</p>
<p>This time, she was utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>It would take two months for her to lose all this weight. After that, who would remember her? Unless… She could connect herself with a more powerful boss.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s eyes lit up at this thought.</p>
<p>But that evening, a new hot search appeared on Weibo that shattered her last hope:</p>
<p><strong>#A former hot star is now as fat as a ball. She was rejected by up to six crews!#</strong></p>
