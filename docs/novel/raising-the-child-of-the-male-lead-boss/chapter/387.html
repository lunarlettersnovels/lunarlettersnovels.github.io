            <p><strong>Chapter 376</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>When they came downstairs again, he kept looking at Yu Yaoyao’s belly.</p>
<p>He didn’t want a younger brother anymore. He wanted a sister.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure if there was already a little brother in his Mommy’s tummy, and if there was, he wasn’t sure if he could return him.</p>
<p>This worried Shen Rui.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao saw Shen Yichong come down with Little Bun, she immediately went and hugged her husband’s arm with a smile. “Darling, I have something on with Little Sisi today. Can you take the kids to kindergarten?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong helplessly obeyed.</p>
<p>But later, he discovered that Yu Yaoyao was still behaving strangely. That night, when Shen Yichong wanted to make love to her in the jacuzzi, she stopped him.</p>
<p>“Darling, not today,” Yu Yaoyao said with a blush and pushed him away.</p>
<p>“Are you on your period?” Shen Yichong frowned. He touched her buttocks, but she pressed his hand down.</p>
<p>“No… It’s just that… We were a little intense the other day. Let’s take a break tonight.” Yu Yaoyao bit her lip.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows. Her red cheeks were very enticing. His mind immediately took him back to the way she’d moaned in bed two days ago… Had he been too rough?</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao carefully glanced at his face. She wondered if he was angry, judging by his stoic expression.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong just smiled and squeezed her cheek gently. “Did you stay up late last night to chat with Ren Sitong? Alright then, I’ll give you a break today. You can go and rest.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was instantly relieved.</p>
<p>But her expression was so obvious that Shen Yichong noticed immediately. He didn’t say anything. He took her out of the hot tub and carried her to their big bed. “You go to bed. I’ll take a shower and check on Shen Rui.”</p>
<p>“Okay, darling.” Yu Yaoyao kissed him, wrapping her hands around his neck.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled. When he got to the bathroom, he realized that he hadn’t brought his pajamas. As he was about to go back to the bedroom to get them, he overheard Yu Yaoyao talking on the phone.</p>
<p>“Little Sisi… Yeah… I followed what the master said. Not today… Tomorrow and the day after are fine, right?” she paused then said, “Okay, okay. I’ll copy that position you told me about. Love you!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned. That all sounded a little strange to him. What the hell was a ‘master’?</p>
<p>Not today? Tomorrow and the day after… Position?</p>
<p>Why was this master involved in others’ business?</p>
<p>He closed the bathroom door silently and stood thinking. But he didn’t interrupt Yu Yaoyao and Ren Sitong’s phone call.</p>
<p>When he was finished in the shower and left the bathroom, he found that all the lights in the bedroom had been dimmed. By the light of the moon, he could see Yu Yaoyao sleeping soundly on the bed with a sweet smile on her face.</p>
<p>He’d wanted to have a serious talk with her, but the urge disappeared when he saw her sleeping form. He stroked her long, soft hair with his palm and smiled happily. Then, he went to the next room to check if their son had turned off the lights and was asleep.</p>
<p>After checking on Shen Rui, he went back to his bedroom and climbed into bed. 9 o’clock was very early for him to go to bed, but he wanted Yu Yaoyao to sleep peacefully. So, he pulled her into his arms and held her gently.</p>
<p>As soon as his head touched the pillow, a sharp pain laced through his neck. He reached over and touched the object. It was a square shape. It seemed to be a wooden sign.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned. He sat up and turned on a dim light. Then, he took a closer look at the object: #Blessed with kids#, it said on the sign.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s handsome face twitched. He’d finally figured out what Yu Yaoyao had been up to the whole day.</p>
<p>He threw the wooden sign on the sofa before going back to sleep.</p>
<p>The next day, they found a hot search about them on Weibo before Yu Yaoyao was even able to get angry with him: #Yu Yaoyao went to the doctor. A second child is on its way!#</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao originally wanted to argue with Shen Yichong. How could he have thrown away the charm she’d begged the master for? But as soon as she saw the news, she immediately touched her belly dumbfounded.</p>
<p>She was so shocked that it was a long while until she looked over at Shen Yichong was a silly expression. “Darling, am I carrying a second child?”</p>
<p>The tone of the hot search was so confident that it made it seem as if the rumor was true.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong sighed. He stretched out a hand and rested it gently on her smooth forehead. Then he looked down at her fair, curvaceous breasts that had been revealed by her half-removed pajamas.</p>
<p>The ancients used to say that people who had big chests usually had no brains. Now, the statement seemed to be true.</p>
<p>“Did you go to the hospital with Ren Sitong yesterday? What else are you hiding from me? Tell me everything,” he said.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao let out a cry and clicked on the hot search. Sure enough, all the pictures had been secretly taken yesterday when she’d gone to see the doctor. How had the paparazzi recognized her when she’d been dressed like a dumpling? And now they were talking nonsense?</p>
<p>She’d just gone for a… Regular check-up.</p>
<p>“Darling… uh, I… I just went to do a physical check-up. Little Sisi said we’re supposed to do it every year.”</p>
<p>“What else?”</p>
<p>“Uh… I also asked the doctor if I can have another baby…”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“Uhh… The doctor said I’m pretty healthy. He said I could eat a little more.”</p>
<p>“And where did you go after that?”</p>
<p>“Uh… After… After that…”</p>
<p>“Did the master ask you to do what you did last night?”</p>
<p>“Wow, darling, you are so smart! How do you know? Oh, you meant the wooden sign! Yeah, it was Little Sisi who said that the master was very powerful. The master told me to first put the wooden sign under your pillow, and then under my pillow the next day.”</p>
<p>“And then, he told you that the day after tomorrow…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t finish his sentence.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was already in shock. She covered her mouth with a look of horror. “Darling, you already knew that?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was speechless.</p>
