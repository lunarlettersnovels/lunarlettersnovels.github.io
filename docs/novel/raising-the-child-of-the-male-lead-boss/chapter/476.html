            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 287 – Crushed By Jealousy (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Ling Shuang clenched her fists. She had blurted it out as an insult and regretted it a little. It would make her look petty in the eyes of Director Ma as well as Shen Yichong. Sure enough, Shen Yichong looked at her, frowning in discomfort. Ling Shuang paled. She couldn’t take it back now. There was no room for regret. She bowed her head, making it seem like it was an earnest request.</p>
<p>Director Ma looked at Ling Shuang and back at Yu Yaoyao, awkwardly. “Ling Shuang,” he said, “you can step out if you are finished.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a classroom where demonstration could be asked. If this went on, every candidate would ask for a demonstration. Director Ma looked at her sternly. If Yu Yaoyao was here to audition, it would have been a different matter. But her husband was investing in the drama, and by default, she became an investor herself. Asking for a demonstration from an investor was ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Could you, please, inform the next candidate to come in, on your way out,” said Director Ma to Ling Shuang, sternly.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang nodded, bowed her head and glanced at Shen Yichong one last time before turning to leave. She felt awful. She had failed the audition, failed to impress Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao had completely insulted her acting skills.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind giving a demonstration,” said a soft voice from behind her. Ling Shuang turned to see Yu Yaoyao standing up from her seat. Her heart filled with hope. She was sure that no matter how accomplished Yu Yaoyao was in acting, she could never portray a young, high-school girl.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang looked at the Director. “That’s not necessary, Ma’am,” said Director Ma, hesitantly.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled at the director. “Director Ma, every actor that comes for an audition works hard to prepare for the role. It is better to fulfill their request and have them convinced.” Ling Shuang’s face stiffened. “As you already know, my husband has been criticized enough for withdrawing his funds and his support from certain investments. I don’t want new rumors and criticisms accusing him of abusing his authority and such. It is better to give the people what they want.” Her words made Ling Shuang look like someone who would cause a scene and start rumors because she was rejected.</p>
<p>“I will never do that, sister Yaoyao,” said Ling Shuang flabbergasted.</p>
<p>“Perhaps I was thinking too much then,” said Yu Yaoyao turning to her. “You kept looking at my husband while talking to the director. I thought you were disappointed and almost angry at him for something. Forgive me.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang was stunned. Yu Yaoyao was shrewd. She wasn’t at all like how Yu Xinjie had described her to be. Yu Yaoyao wasn’t easily fooled or deceived. She turned the tables on Ling Shuang. Nothing Ling Shuang could say to redeem her image would matter.</p>
<p>“Director Ma,” said Yu Yaoyao, “Since this young lady has prepared so much for the role, I will accept her request for a demonstration. Besides, I do not want my husband’s image to be tarnished, so it’s only fair. I am very scared of being criticized by the public. If you would be so kind, could you give your permission as well?”</p>
<p>“Please go ahead then, Ms. Yu Yaoyao,” said Director Ma, nodding.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t object. He had full confidence in Yu Yaoyao and was in full support of whatever she wanted to do. As Yu Yaoyao walked from her seat, Shen Yichong squeezed her hand in encouragement. Then he got up from his seat, script in hand. “I will read the lines of the male lead with her this time,” he said.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s heart ached. She was so jealous that she tried hard not to show her tears. He cared so much about Yu Yaoyao. <em>She doesn’t deserve him, </em>thought Ling Shuang. She had no idea when they had become so close and affectionate with each other. Despite being a major investor, and a boss of a massive company, he accompanied Yu Yaoyao like a simple actor in an audition to help her with the lines! He didn’t need to, and yet.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at her and flashed her a radiant smile. “Miss Ling,” she said politely, “Can we take the stage, please? Thank you.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang walked to the side, fists clenched. She hated seeing them together. A happy couple, no less.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao walked to the desk and sat on the chair. She stretched out her hand and untied her hair, which had been in a bun. Her curly black hair fell on her shoulders. She flicked her hair to make it seem a little messy and pulled them back behind her ears, with only a few lonely strands around her face. She thought for a while and pulled Shen Yichong’s sleeve to wipe the lipstick off her lips. Director Ma almost laughed at this. While Ling Shuang’s heart thundered in rage.</p>
<p>In the next second, Yu Yaoyao sat there at the desk, transformed. She looked young and frustrated. She indeed looked like a lost high school girl unable to make sense of her world. She shrugged her shoulders and slumped down on the desk, as though living was a burden. Her face looked so desolate. She pushed the props and books from the table to the ground.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to go to college, I don’t need to, do I?” she said, in character, “What purpose do I have there, anyway? Can’t people lead a decent life without having to go to college? What do I need to accomplish there?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had just skimmed the script, so she only knew half the lines, the rest she improvised. Her low voice became even lower and hopeless as she said the lines, as though she was questioning everything around her. She sounded sad and doubtful, no longer sure of anything she said.</p>
