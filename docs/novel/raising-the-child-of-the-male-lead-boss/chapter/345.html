            <p><strong>Chapter 418</strong></p>
<p>Many experienced mothers knew that Shen Yichong was only coaxing Yu Yaoyao. Giving birth to a baby was no simple matter. She also couldn’t eat food that had a strong taste during confinement or breastfeeding period. Still, no one exposed him.</p>
<p>Even when they knew that Yu Yaoyao could not see, they also cooperated with Shen Yichong’s performance in the comments. They all knew the fact. But they just wanted to keep her happy for a short while. Sure enough, Yu Yaoyao breathed a sigh of relief after the injection. Even her tone was lighter.</p>
<p>“Then have Chen Lin give the list to me next time. I’ll be happy to see it even if I can’t eat the snacks yet,” she chirped happily.</p>
<p>“Okay. I’ll have him write the list today. You can see it when we get home after the check-up,” Shen Yichong replied.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ll read it every day~ The list could help me get through~”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sounded happy.</p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen acted like he was coaxing a child~]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Impressive!]</strong></p>
<p>After the blood test was completed, the follow-up series of examinations were basically one-to-one. The cameramen also went inside to film after obtaining the doctor’s permission, and the live broadcast room was reopened.</p>
<p>At this moment, everyone realized that Yaoyao’s belly had gotten really big! She rarely appeared in front of the screen before, and she rarely posted full-length photos on Weibo. While recording the last issue of “Welcome to My Home”, she also wore loose black clothes most of the time. Because of that, her belly couldn’t really be seen.</p>
<p>But it became very obvious this time. It was almost impossible for her to button up the shirt jacket that covered her on the outside. Except for her bulging belly, everything else on her body was still thin. The group of fans were feeling jealous while in love with her.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After the check-up, they went to a course designed for the fathers-to-be.</p>
<p>It was called a class, but the main intention of the class was to let the fathers-to-be experience the hardships of pregnant mothers. This was so that they can better understand the needs of pregnant mothers and learn to take care of their newborn babies.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was familiar with everything, but he had never taken this kind of course before. He learned it from the nanny at home when Shen Rui was still a baby.</p>
<p>“Dear fathers-to-be, please put on the corresponding outfit that could help you understand the physical feelings of pregnant mothers during the whole process. Not only do you have a drooping belly, a sore waist and an inability to squat, but standing or sitting for a long time can cause pain and stiffness in your back.”</p>
<p>The faces of Shen Yichong and Da Fu both turned black. Da Fu was even an actor in his early days. Although he didn’t belong to an idol group, he still had an image to be preserved. Let alone Shen Yichong. After all, he was the boss to many company employees, and he usually had to establish prestige. It was really a little embarrassing for them to wear the maternity dress in public.</p>
<p>“Darling, just try to experience it~ The team will pay for it!”</p>
<p>“Fufu, try it so you understand how hard it was for me back then~”</p>
<p>The two men couldn’t reject it anymore after their wives called out.</p>
<p>In addition, Little Bun was also eager to try. He wasn’t even shy to ask. He found the person in charge of the course. “Teacher, may I also experience it? Is my size available?”</p>
<p>He was so small that he could barely reach the waist of the female teacher. However, his chubby little face was full of seriousness.</p>
<p>“I also want to know how hard it is for my mommy to give birth to my younger sister and myself.”</p>
<p>The female teacher couldn’t stand his cuteness. Her heart was melted on the spot by the little guy.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a size for children. It’ll be too heavy for you.” The female teacher said regretfully.</p>
<p>Little Bun suddenly looked depressed. He looked back at Shen Yichong with an extremely envious look. The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. He put on the outfit in front of him without expression, as if his son would snatch it away if he was one second late. Little Bun’s face was filled with regret, and he almost begged the teacher to make one for him on the spot.</p>
<p>In the end, Yu Yaoyao comforted him, “It’s okay, baby. Didn’t you bring your basketball to play? You can stuff it into your clothes along with two oranges when we get home.”</p>
<p>Little Bun’s eyes suddenly lit up! He looked back at the structure of his father’s clothes. Then. he looked at his mommy’s belly..</p>
<p>He nodded in satisfaction on the spot. “I need a basketball. Football is not big enough.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed his eyebrows.</p>
<p>The female teacher covered her mouth and laughed.</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room also couldn’t contain their laughter. They all rewarded the family with gifts after being amused by Little Bun. Even though he seemed nosy, it was all because he loved his mommy. His rare sensibility and caring even inspired the maternal love of a group of female fans!</p>
<p>In the end, Da Fu had no choice but to put it on. Under the enthusiasm of Shen Rui, he really couldn’t refuse it. Later on, Little Bun also paid more attention than anyone else when the teacher was teaching them how to bath the baby.</p>
<p>While listening, he also shot videos with his tablet. He was obviously planning to review it again after going back.</p>
<p>“Alright. Today’s class is over. Do we have any questions from our father-to-be?”</p>
<p>It was not the first time that Shen Yichong and Da Fu became fathers. They didn’t raise their hands.</p>
<p>Little Bun, on the other hand, had his hand raised. “Teacher, I’ve a question! For diapers… how do I do it behind here?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squeezed his eyebrows, “Shen Rui…the teacher asked daddy, not you.”</p>
<p>The fans in the live broadcast rooms were all screaming. If they have a daughter in the future, they must make her marry Little Bun! He was so thoughtful!</p>
