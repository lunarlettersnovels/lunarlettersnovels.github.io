<p><strong>Chapter 490</strong></p>
<p>At that time, he even looked down on Yu Yaoyao. He felt that her appearance was too beautiful to be competent for the role of a killer. If it wasn’t for screenwriter Liu’s strong recommendation and asking him to give her a chance, maybe he would have missed it.</p>
<p>Of course, having Mr. Shen as the main investor was also part of his luck. If it weren’t for Guangxin’s investment, Yu Yaoyao would definitely not have read the script at that time, let alone wanting to try the role of the female lead.</p>
<p>In the end, it was all luck. Fate, in other words.</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean by you’re just lucky? Are you the one that got an amulet?”</p>
<p>Director Liang’s mouth twitched, “Don’t talk nonsense! Don’t believe such rumours! If you’re free, how about pulling out some films and analyse how other directors film them!”</p>
<p>He opposed his friend’s idea of taking a shortcut.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by rumour? Liang, haven’t you watched the news? It’s even shared all over Weibo. A reporter took a photo of Yu Yaoyao and Mr. Shen going abroad. It’s said that they went there to repay their vows. Everyone on the Internet knows about it!”</p>
<p>Director Liang, “…”</p>
<p>He really didn’t know about that.</p>
<p>He never went on Weibo. Also…what kind of news could Weibo offer? It must all be fake news! And as his friend said, the rumour did spread on the Internet. <em>‘Yu Yaoyao went abroad to seek fame and baby’</em> became a hot search headline almost overnight.</p>
<p>Screenwriter Liu had also received several calls for verification. Ni Yi, Shen Lin, Guangxin’s public relations, marketing department, and even the servants of the Shen family received a lot of calls regarding the topic.</p>
<p>The hot search topic sounded as if it had proofs.</p>
<p><em>‘Yu Yaoyao and Shen Yichong both excused themselves from the premiere saying that they need to take care of their newborn. However, they were caught leaving their children behind and travelled to the capital of country T. They also appeared near the Erawan Buddha. Netizens speculated that it was to repay their vows. Rumour has it that the amulet does help!’</em></p>
<p>The reporter who wrote this even pushed the blame for this conclusion on netizens. But many people on the Internet bought the story nonetheless. Everyone was gossiping. There were even many who were superstitious, especially women.</p>
<p>Even YY fans felt that it might be true. Some of them left comments under the hot search topic, asking which master did Yaoyao go to and the specific address, as they also wanted to visit. It was frequently reported before that many Hong Kong stars and mainland stars had gone there to have their wishes granted and visit the master.</p>
<p>This time, everyone was not surprised at all that Yu Yaoyao would be involved in news like this.. Coupled with her personal portfolio, the authenticity of this gossip seemed even more credible.</p>
<p><em>‘According to findings, Yu Yaoyao was just a young trainee with extremely poor speaking skills and a stiff expression five years ago. But after marrying into the wealthy Shen family, she turned into a female supporting actress who could even bring capital to the cast. It was just that her fortune was still pretty terrible. All her characters received a lot of criticism. It didn’t change until she gave birth to her eldest son. After five years of recuperation at home, she came back again, and her momentum was overwhelming. All the films, television dramas and variety shows she joined became popular!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Five years ago, Yu Yaoyao went to country T with her mother and sister, and was photographed near the Erawan Buddha.’</em></p>
<p>There were various speculations on the Internet, and the popularity had directly risen to the top. The key was that Yu Yaoyao was really on a streak, and she got more popular each time! Although some fans defended her that she won by strength, the comments were soon overwhelmed in the voice of the superstitious party.</p>
<p>“Hehe, darling, are they flattering me or mocking me?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was lying on a carpet by the beach. They were currently in a  resort. After looking at Little Sweetheart who was still biting her fingers, she rolled directly to Shen Yichong’s side.</p>
<p>“They made it sound like it’s true.”</p>
<p>Everyone might not believe what happened in country T five years ago. It was this body who had a ‘blind date’ with Shen Yichong, and he was also there to talk about a merger. As dramas from country T had gradually become popular in recent years, and had done well in certain markets in the local area and throughout Southeast Asia, Guangxin considered entering overseas entertainment here at that time.</p>
<p>It was also at that time when the family brought ‘Yu Yaoyao’ there to see Shen Yichong, trying to sell their daughter.</p>
<p>Today, five years later, Little Bun, Little Sweetheart, and herself were there with Shen Yichong for a business trip. They were here to take a look at the shooting location of the new project. She fell in love with a new script, which was a funny theme that she had never done before.</p>
<p>The heroine was a poor girl who left the country for country T to be a tour guide. However, she later got involved in a theft incident, and even bargained her body to a rich male protagonist. The two later worked together in assisting the police to track down a group of thieves who stole a precious gem of the male protagonist. This time, Yu Yaoyao came to inspect the shooting location while also having a vacation.</p>
<p>“Darling, they’ve wronged me. I can only feel better if you give me a hug~”</p></div>
