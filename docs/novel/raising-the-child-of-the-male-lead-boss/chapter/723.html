            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 28 – Don’t Underestimate Her</strong></p>
<p>“Director, can you use fake—”</p>
<p>Director Li straightforwardly shot his suggestion down. “Do you think the audience is blind? They can see it at a glance if the snake is genuine or not!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi wiped his sweat. “Then, can we use a stunt double?”</p>
<p>Director Li merely frowned, “It’s not a martial arts scene. It’s just snakes without fangs; there’s no danger!” and maliciously added, “I already sent you the script a long time ago. If you weren’t able to do it, you should have not accepted it!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s mood suddenly turned sour.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Director Li was already intent on shooting this scene. Just to give them a show of authority!</p>
<p>“Little Yiyi. Let’s go!” Yu Yaoyao turned back and waved at her ashen-face manager. “Let’s finish my makeup fast—I still want to lie down for a while.”</p>
<p>Director Li took a deep breath and tried to press his anger down, while Meng Xinran couldn’t help but admire her cockiness. She smirked, eager to see a good show.</p>
<p>Ni Yi whispered. “Sister, don’t be stubborn and offend the director. You won’t be able to stay if you do so!”</p>
<p><i>If the director is unsatisfied with her performance, she is going to get backlashed for sure! </i></p>
<p><i>She’s dead meat!!</i></p>
<p>Ni Yi sincerely felt regret in his heart, “It’s my fault, I should have helped you find another role.”</p>
<p>“I will go apologize and beg Director Li to kill the snakes for the scene. Sister, I have read this scene—you just have to close your eyes, lie down, and pretend it’s just a toy. You don’t have to be afraid!”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. There’s no need to kill the snakes.” As they entered the dressing room, Yu Yaoyao merely shook her head in reply.</p>
<p>In addition to the snakes caught for the purpose of tourist attraction in a zoo, many snakes in the wild are also hunted by humans to use in traditional medicine or exotic cuisine. The number had been too high that she wasn’t able to save enough.</p>
<p>But when it happens in front of your very eyes—if you can save it, then save it.</p>
<p>“Life is easy. After this scene is over, you ask them to bring the snakes to a conservation center.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was so dumbfounded and could only say: “Ah?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gave him a strange look. “With their fangs pulled out, it would be difficult for them to survive in the wild. If they won’t let them go…I remember that the Guangxin Company also has a lot of fish tanks. Just send them to Shen Yichong as an office pet. We should wait for the teeth to grow out before we release them back to the wild.”</p>
<p>“Sister …  did you lost your mind after the director scolded you?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi continued to recite the script as if it was his own while she was having her makeup done. The little sister makeup artist did not dare to interrupt the whole process. But after Yu Yaoyao was called to act, she spoke in a low voice with a hint of worship. “Sister Yu, thank you just now. You are really beautiful—the most beautiful actress I have seen. And you are very kind … Older Sister Yu, fighting!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao grinned and patted her on the shoulder. “You have good taste.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi wiped his sweat from behind her.</p>
<p>When she went out, Director Li Bo was still being foul-mouthed to the props group, but when he saw her, he became silent.</p>
<p>Other people also stopped what they were currently doing at hand.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was dressed in white, her black hair in a baggy bun. She had light makeup on, just a sheen coating of powder, and her lips were plump and pink, her white teeth peeking out.</p>
<p>She stood there as if she was a lady that had come out from a painting.</p>
<p>Li Bo was the first to wake up from his stupor, and he pointed a finger at the antique bed in front of the camera. “Layer on the bed and cover yourself with the quilt. And don’t forget to close your eyes. In this scene, you have to perform feeling the strange sensation of snakes crawling at you in your sleep. When you open your eyes and see them directly in front of you, you should have a look of horror on your face.</p>
<p>He continued. “Yell ‘Somebody, help!’ and then when you get bitten by the snakes you should show that you are struggling in fear and in immense pain. Lastly passing out in a coma. I’ll only say this once. Go! This is the most important scene. If you can’t do it, we will replace or delete it from the show!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi quickly whispered. “Sister, I will help you remember. You go now and I’ll give the script back to you if the take’s no good.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao squinted, opened the script and gave it a cursory glance, and then handed it to Ni Yi.</p>
<p>“What do you mean <i>‘if the take is no good’</i>? Just look, I will do it in one take!”</p>
