            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 183 – Changing Investments (1)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s earnest appeal was mercilessly rejected, she was a little frustrated. But it soon faded as she saw her husband personally get the oyster from the chef and squeeze some lemon on top of it.</p>
<p>“You have already starred in two variety shows in a row, the ratings of the shows could be very high but your exposure is somewhat limited. And so far, after the competition, I’ve realized there’s a lot more things you need to learn,” he said, squeezing the lemon.</p>
<p>“For now, you need to take more lessons and develop your acting skills.” He added while wiping his hands with a tissue.</p>
<p>Hearing him, Yu Yaoyao pouted, but as she sniffed the delicious aroma of the cooked food, she instantly licked her lips. The oysters in front of her looked tender and full. She couldn’t wait to devour those.</p>
<p>“You need to practice and further improve yourself so that you can portray the role you want for a well-received movie or show in the industry.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had never thought that he would marry someone who’s obsessed with food. But he paused a little as he remembered something.</p>
<p>“I will ask Chen Lin to look for cooking show scripts that have high ratings. Study those for now.”</p>
<p>All of this was done for investment purposes.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes lit up in an instant. And because of what he said, she joyfully picked up the oyster, carefully bringing it to her mouth, and sucked it with a sizzle using a chopstick. She picked another one and mixed it with the salty and slightly sour lemon extract, and immediately filled her small mouth with its chewy, delicate and tender meat.</p>
<p>The moment she tasted it, a big wave from the bottom of the sea rushed to the tip of her tongue!</p>
<p>“Woah!”</p>
<p>In an instant, Yu Yaoyao covered her mouth as she was surprised by its exquisite taste. With just a bit of chewing, she felt like she was on cloud nine!</p>
<p>“Wooo… wooo… woo…”</p>
<p>The premium taste of seafood was now inside her mouth!</p>
<p>As an ordinary snake who lived for 200 years, this was her first time eating such fresh seafood! She had never experienced such a luscious taste!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was busy shaving some crab meat with a fork for the little bun, looked at her, bewildered. Her cute scream stopped him from what he was doing. On the other hand, Shen Rui, on the high-chair, looked at his mom excitedly.</p>
<p>“Mommy, Mommy, is it delicious? Eat more! In the future, if Baby Rui has money, I will take you to different restaurants that cook mouthwatering foods~ Let’s eat together, Mommy!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao chewed the meat twice with a feeling that she would pass out from happiness. She never had the intention of swallowing it, only wanting to savor its juiciness.</p>
<p>Soon, she nodded, as if her thoughts were right.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at his wife, who was so fond of munching the food, and finally sighed in surrender.</p>
<p>“I will tell Director Zhao Yu that the succeeding issues will be filmed in restaurants.”</p>
<p>He really had no choice but to let the public see his wife eating in restaurants. At this moment, her eyes were shining. Although her mouth was full, rendering her mute for all this time, her small, snowy face looked like it was moved by the appetizing food… a dainty beauty who concealed nothing.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes narrowed. It had been a long time since he’d seen a woman with such qualities. Ever since he became an adult, he had put all his best into his work. All women who approached him always wore masks. Just like Yu Yaoyao who was sent to him and his mother who left the family…</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had a profound gaze as he looked at Yu Yaoyao’s flawless face.</p>
<p>“Do you really like it that much?”</p>
<p>“Hmm ~” Yu Yaoyao had no time to answer him.</p>
<p>Soon, the chef delivered the crispy and bouncy Australian lobster. The rich fragrance and attractive color of the food that had just arrived easily caught the attention of the unrefined woman.</p>
<p>In no less than a second, with the aid of a fork, a small piece of lobster was pierced and then sent to the trap. The juicy and chewy taste made her small face flushed!</p>
<p>It only took a glance for Shen Yichong to know that she really liked it.</p>
<p>“When I am half full, I will eat the paella.” Yu Yaoyao, who didn’t like pasta and rice, suddenly raised her small face with a lobster shell hanging in her mouth.</p>
<p>“Mommy, you have to eat it, otherwise your stomach will ache, and you will feel uncomfortable~” Little Bun persuaded his mom wisely.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded as well.</p>
<p>“The paella here is authentic. Almost all diners order one. Balance your meal and try it later.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded reluctantly. But half an hour later, she… unexpectedly ate all of it!</p>
<p>“Husband, give me another bowl of paella!” She was handing out the small bowl after she’d scooped out the remains into her mouth in one breath.</p>
<p>“Just tell me if you want more.” Shen Yichong pursed his lips, reached out to her and took the grain of rice that had stuck to the corner of her lips.</p>
<p>Her skin was very soft and smooth, but the moment his fingertips made contact with her bare skin, he felt an electrifying pulse and warmth on the inside.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong narrowed his eyes and looked up, signaling the waiter for the bill.</p>
<p>The son’s little belly was bulging, and Yu Yaoyao had polished off the little one’s portion as well. He glanced at her small waist, which was now tightly grasping her dress and his expression right now was nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>“I can’t eat anymore.” Yu Yaoyao didn’t realize that she had wolfed down five lobsters tonight.</p>
<p>He immediately led the mother and the son outside the restaurant to their car. However, before they could get in, a man rushed towards them.</p>
<p>“Big sister, you look so beautiful while eating! I’m from the Dazhi live broadcast platform. You can sign up as a member and do various food shows! I watched you for half an hour from outside the building, and I know that you will definitely become popular! Live broadcast is done for one hour per day, and you will receive millions of dollars in a month!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face, in an instant, turned dull.</p>
<p>“We won’t do it.” He replied curtly.</p>
<p>But the man who approached them, acted as if he didn’t hear Shen Yichong, and quickly thrust a business card into Yu Yaoyao’s hand, then ran away screaming-</p>
<p>“Sister, all women want to be independent, don’t rely on men!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
