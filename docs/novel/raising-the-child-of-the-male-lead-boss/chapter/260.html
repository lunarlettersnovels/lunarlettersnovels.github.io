            <p><strong>Chapter 501</strong></p>
<p>‘Cat’ was on the hot searches five times during the period it was broadcasted. A cute cat with a dream and its loving interaction with its owner quickly conquered the hearts of the majority of netizens and cat owners.</p>
<p><strong>[I’m curious about Little Bell’s dream.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[My Fat Tiger just sunbathes every day, enjoying its carefree life under the sun. They have the exact same posture!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Every time I scratch the fluffy head of our Little Princess, it will show its belly and let me rub it. Hahaha! The Little Black in the movie acts similarly to cats in real life!]</strong></p>
<p>Everyone was convinced by the cat protagonist, and even products fashioned after stray cats were sold out. Both the main investor, Guangxin, and the director, Da Fu, had received good reviews in the industry. It even tempted many viewers to raise a cat; it set off a craze for raising pets for a while.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>During this period of time, Yu Yaoyao continued to stay happily at home after finishing work. She would pick up any scripts, as long as she liked it. She would also appear as a guest on variety shows, as long as she didn’t have to stay overnight. Given that she wasn’t in any crew, she would work only a day or two in a week. She was really living a free and easy life. Thinking back, when she was at the zoo, she had to work every day. There were no weekends or holidays, but now, her world had undergone earth-shaking changes!</p>
<p>“Darling, I feel so happy now,” she said, hugging Shen Yichong’s arm with a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s stoic face also couldn’t help but show a handsome smile as he hugged her waist. Little Bun was playing with his sister at the side. Upon hearing this, he raised his head. His black eyes were bright with pleasure and satisfaction. “I also feel so happy!” he added.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. This was the happiness belonging to husband and wife, what was this kid doing here?</p>
<p>But soon, all the coldness on his face disappeared. Looking down, he saw Little Sweetheart’s dark eyes, who was trying hard to hug his thigh. She was wearing a lavender-colored, princess dress. Her two fair and tender little hands grabbed his trousers as she raised her chubby face. She threw her body on top of him while trying to climb up.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong suddenly smiled. He then hugged his adorable baby girl in his arms.</p>
<p>“Daddy, Little Sweetheart likes to crawl on the ground, and she has to walk more so that she builds strength in her legs…” Little Bun protested. “I’m playing a game with her. The loser has to walk and get a toy.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui, who was now taller, but had not been allowed to help his sister walk, was always jealous that Shen Yichong could hold Little Sweetheart for a long time. Every time Shen Yichong took Little Sweetheart away, he would try and cause trouble.</p>
<p>“Enough.” Shen Yichong waved his hand. “She just walked around. She needs a rest.”</p>
<p>The old father, who had no principles and a bottom line, directly rejected his son’s resistance. Shen Rui immediately puffed out his cheeks and looked at his mommy for help.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao could only spread her hands. “Well… let Little Sweetheart rest for ten minutes before another walk,” she bargained.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked back at her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao: “…fifteen minutes?”</p>
<p>“Mommy!” Shen Rui protested.</p>
<p>“It would be useless even if you call your Mommy.” Shen Yichong narrowed his eyes and looked at his son. “Back then, your mommy would complain that her legs were sore after only walking two steps. Didn’t you also let me carry your mommy? You don’t remember, eh?”</p>
<p>Shen Rui” “…”</p>
<p>“Now, Little Sweetheart is just taking a rest. What are you complaining about, as a big brother?” Shen Yichong continued mercilessly. He was currently overcome with the spirit who was a slave to his daughter.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed and patted Little Bun comfortingly. It was all her fault that she was not upright back then! She had no right to force her daughter to walk on the ground. Back then, she would tell Shen Yichong that her legs were sore only after taking two steps. Little Bun would also stand by her side.</p>
<p>“Your mum is almost thirty, and she still needs me to feed her. And you, the son, strongly requested me to feed her as well,” Shen Yichong continued. “Your little sister is still growing, but it’s already amazing that she can eat by herself!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was proud when he said this.</p>
<p>“I’m not yet thirty, darling! I’m only twenty!” Yu Yaoyao said from the side. But her temples were also knotting. “Little Sweetheart can eat by herself? You mean, the time when she dropped a spoonful of rice on me after picking up a spoon?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Shen Yichong was calm, as if it was not a big problem. “Little Sweetheart has been a good girl since young.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s mouth couldn’t help twitching. Shen Rui even slapped his forehead… His Daddy was helpless!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After the filming of the first season for ‘Welcome to My Home’ successfully ended, the family of four lived a warm life, hardly disturbed by anyone. Since there was no camera following them, they enjoyed their rare, very peaceful day.</p>
<p>By May, Yu Yaoyao had more work calls. The selection and review work for The Golden Rooster Award had started. In the past two years, she has made more than one film. It was a big problem which role of hers should be used to apply for trial.</p>
