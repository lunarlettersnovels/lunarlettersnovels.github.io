            <p><strong>Chapter 401</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s expression was unreadable when he took the live broadcast equipment from the staff.</p>
<p>“Darling, do you want me to help?” Yu Yaoyao offered. She couldn’t stand to see him like this.</p>
<p>“No, you go take a nap,” he replied</p>
<p>It was already noon when they arrived at the cabin. She had eaten her nutritious meal she had brought with her for lunch, but they had nothing prepared for her dinner. Shen Yichong needed to earn money quickly so he could buy the ingredients he needed to cook for her in time.</p>
<p>Even though he had an arduous task before him, he still took her up to the master bedroom.</p>
<p>He checked the room to make sure Xiao Xang had put the bedcover on they’d brought with. Then he asked Yu Yaoyao to change into her pajamas and down lay on the bed.</p>
<p>“Our son and I can handle it. You rest,” he said.</p>
<p>Once she had laid down, he helped her snuggle under the quilt. Before he left, he made sure he covered all the cameras in the room, and only walked out the door once he saw her close her eyes.</p>
<p>When he walked into the living room it was to find a row of cameramen, and Director Zhao Yu, all waiting for him. Zhao Yu was obviously waiting to watch the show. Shen Yichong gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, we took Teacher Yu’s condition into consideration while coming up with this task. We must be sure teacher Yu has a good rest. We as men will try our best to take care of all the work.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t speak a word, only regarded him with a cool gaze. Then he picked up the live broadcast equipment, microphone and miniature camera on the coffee table.</p>
<p>By now, Little Bun had also changed into a set of casual clothes in his bedroom. He secretly went to the master bedroom to take a peek at his mother. Once he was satisfied she was resting, he went to the living room to report to his father.</p>
<p>“Daddy, Mommy is asleep.”</p>
<p>“Ok.” Shen Yichong replied as he started fiddling with the camera, a serious expression on his face.</p>
<p>He had never done a live broadcast before. But he had seen them.</p>
<p>As the owner of an entertainment company, he had done research into the Internet celebrities, and he knew what the popular live broadcasters did.</p>
<p>They ate, sang, played games…</p>
<p>And he couldn’t do any of that.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face was grave</p>
<p>“Daddy, have you started yet?” Shen Rui asked. He was a kid who had already been quite exposed to the ways of the world.</p>
<p>A little over a year ago he had watched his mother’s live game. He knew a bit about the number of viewers and gift money.</p>
<p>He sat on the small solo sofa next to Shen Yichong and took out his tablet.</p>
<p>“Daddy, what’s your room number? I’ll go in so you’ll have one viewer already.” His plan was to secretly use his pocket money to reward his father with gift money.</p>
<p>Little Bun glanced at the Director and decided to keep his idea to himself.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong clicked to open the live broadcast software. He discovered that the program group had already registered a live broadcast room for him. He just had to start the broadcast.</p>
<p>He shared the website with Little Bun and logged in with his own account as well, before glancing coldly at the row of staff in front of him.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu almost laughed, “Mr. Shen, we only add up to a dozen people. Your first small goal is 10,000.” He was implying that it would be useless, even if they all helped.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong continued to stare at him.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu finally sighed, “Fine. Send me the link. I’ll go in and give you a like.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong then stared at the cameramen.</p>
<p>He was the boss after all.</p>
<p>Within seconds, everyone crumbled under the weight of his stare. They quickly took out their phones and logged in to help increase the number of viewers in Shen Yichong’s broadcast room.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, a few more viewers entered the live broadcast room.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked handsome and cool in a rather attractive, masculine way.</p>
<p>It was only a few moments later that a few girls who had never seen him before commented in the room; ‘Handsome guy!’</p>
<p>Total number of viewers: 1</p>
<p>Then Little Bun entered the room. He couldn’t help but feel anxious after seeing his father’s slow, near unbearable progress. “Dad, it’s almost half past 12 now. Granny usually prepares tea at 1 o’clock, and then starts preparing dinner at 4 or 5 o’clock. You’re running out of time.”</p>
<p>His daddy still had a long way to go.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong just sat on the sofa with his brows frowned, staring at the screen of the live broadcast room. After thinking for a while, he finally had an idea.</p>
<p>He took out his own phone, posted on Weibo and sent out emails and text messages.</p>
<p>10 minutes later, the number of viewers suddenly jumped to more than 500!</p>
<p>Many YY fans were following Shen Yichong’s Weibo. As soon as they saw his post saying he was doing a live broadcast, and everyone was invited to watch, they were all very excited.</p>
<p><em>[Did Mr. Shen change his style? He’s suddenly doing a live broadcast!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is our Yaoyao here? Mr. Shen, please give the camera to my husband!]</em></p>
<p><em>[What kind of show is Mr. Shen on?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Ah, has the recording of ‘Welcome to My Home’ started?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Don’t tell me this is a live broadcast! Mr. Shen, you’re looking at the camera with such a stoic expression…]</em></p>
<p>The number of viewers steadily started rising</p>
<p>It wasn’t long until the fans heard Little Bun’s voice. He was busy keeping count of the viewers in real time. He kept cheering for his father and telling him there was still a shortage of views.</p>
<p>That was how everyone realized that it was a variety show task that required at least 10,000 viewers.</p>
<p><em>[I’ll help by sharing Mr. Shen’s Weibo post!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’ll go notify the others in the fans group.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen, allow me to give a suggestion. Can you perform something? I feel a little panicked watching this because you look like my boss the way you’re staring at me.]</em></p>
