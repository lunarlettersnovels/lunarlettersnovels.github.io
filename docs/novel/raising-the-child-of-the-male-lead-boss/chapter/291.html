            <p><strong>Chapter 472</strong></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye swallowed her saliva. Of course she wanted to go to Yaoyao’s house too. Later, she began to frantically ask Ye Yun about the small details of her visit to Yaoyao’s house. Shortly after, the takeaway also arrived.</p>
<p>Since Yaoyao and Shen Yichong were now more familiar with the process, the speed of cooking and delivering both improved. When Fang Qiuye began to enjoy every grain of rice and vegetable in the afternoon, she suddenly received a call from Ni Yi!</p>
<p>“I’ll send you a form later. Please give me your identity information, since we need to record it. I’ll also share with you the address before the appointed time.”</p>
<p>“This English tutoring session will be recorded throughout the program, would you be okay with that?”</p>
<p>“Next, the program staff will contact you. You need to sign a contract to be on camera. On the day of recording, you also need to do some make up and make some preparations… By the way, I’ll share with you Yaoyao’s current learning progress after you signed the contract with the program team.”</p>
<p>“I…I..I’ll be on the show? Your guys are reco…recording ‘Welcome to My Home’!?” Fang Qiuye’s voice was shaking.</p>
<p>“Yes, you are welcome as a guest,” Ni Yi answered quickly. “I will send you some precautions and a non-disclosure agreement. Please give me your email address.”</p>
<p>He paused after this, and said, “Your id looks familiar. Where have I seen it…?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye: “…”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Darling, ’Gentle temper’ seems a little familiar.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Yu Yaoyao, who had just finished recording for the show, asked the same question as Ni Yi.</p>
<p>“This seems to be my fan… the No.1 top fan?”</p>
<p>Although Yu Yaoyao didn’t really care about many things, she could remember the praises she received. They were clear in her mind, almost to the point that she could even recite them!</p>
<p>While she was mulling this, Shen Yichong already knew Fang Qiuye’s identity from the very beginning. After all, he had been part of the fan group for a while.</p>
<p>“Yes. She’s the president of your fan group,” he confirmed. “A while ago, I asked the marketing department to contact her and have her sign an agreement to manage the fan group.”</p>
<p>She was one of their people. This was also why Shen Yichong didn’t object to Yu Yaoyao recklessly asking a random netizen to come to their house as her teacher.</p>
<p>The original intention of ‘Welcome to My Home’ was to invite friends from all over the world to be guests. But later, Yu Yaoyao had Little Sweetheart, and to reassure himself, he invited guests that he already knew. This was also why the invitations back then were only extended to artists who had good relationships with her.</p>
<p>This led to a situation where the audience, who really should be the guests of the show, never showed up. But now that her body had recovered, it was time to invite other people to participate in the show and welcome them to their home.</p>
<p>The club president was a very appropriate candidate for the first visitor. When he looked at the reward record of ‘Gentle Temper’ on the live broadcast platform, he confirmed that the id belonged to the president herself. Many of the fans’ managers in the entertainment industry were directly appointed by the entertainment company, so as to facilitate the management of the company and prevent crazy fans from doing things that were out of control. But due to Shen Yichong’s personal philosophy, Guangxin never dealt with such matters. The fan managers of its artists were almost all selected by the fans themselves.</p>
<p>Usually, Guangxin would only contact the fans manager to understand some basic background, character and provide support agreements after the contact. They would also provide the president some personal subsidies for support. Therefore, ‘Gentle Temper’ was someone he trusted. But all of these were handled by the people in the marketing department. Neither Shen Yichong nor Yu Yaoyao will participate in the process. With that, they had no prior contact with the president.</p>
<p>“Wow!” Yaoyao exclaimed happily. “Honey, all my fans seem to be super awesome!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled helplessly. He had already obtained the personal information filled in by the president from the marketing department. Physics major. Web Writer…</p>
<p>No matter how he looked at this information, it didn’t seem like she had great English skills.</p>
<p>His wife’s energy also seemed to attract odd people sometimes. This time, the person turned out to be a professional network writer. Her personal works were also noted in the information, and all the titles of her writing gave him a headache.</p>
<p>If he must point out something that was worrying about inviting the president to their house, it was about her instilling weird ideas inside Yu Yaoyao’s mind. If that happened, he bet that even Zhao Yu couldn’t control the situation while they were shooting the tutoring scene!</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>And when Shen Yichong was a little worried, Gong Xuechang, who just finished his lecture on English, walked out of the lecture hall.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, Gong Xuechang found that his phone in his pocket was vibrating. When he took it out, he stopped on the spot.</p>
<p><em>[Teacher, let’s go out on a date!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Teacher, I’m not playing. I just… want to learn English well!]</em></p>
<p>Gong Xuechang, “…?”</p>
