            <p><strong>Chapter 240 – Public Trial (1)</strong></p>
<p>When the car was halfway through, they received a notice from the crew of “Chaos” that the filming on one particular scene where Yu Yaoyao  jumps from the building was postponed until early morning of the following day. The shooting earlier didn’t go smoothly as planned which led to the postponement of the following scenes.</p>
<p>The crew informed Yu Yaoyao to join the group early and to have her hair and make-up at four o’clock the next morning. This means they must finish shooting before the sun comes out.</p>
<p>In the script, Sheng Ji faced the last afterglow of the sunset and then jumped off the platform and ended her beautiful life.</p>
<p>They were in a hurry to finish the shooting so as not to affect the progress of the show.</p>
<p>The scene can only be captured if they start shooting when the sun rises in the early hours of the morning. Anyway, the first beam of sunlight was about the same as the last one.</p>
<p>Although Yu Yaoyao was sad, she understood the misfortunes that had happened earlier.</p>
<p>And with her husband around, she had found comfort from all the things that had happened.</p>
<p>“I asked Chen Lin to find a hotel near the venue so that after picking up my son we can stay in the hotel for a night since I just need half an hour to get up and get ready early tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>Because the play was rescheduled, they did not join the group and decided to leave together.</p>
<p>After Shen Yichong joined her, they went away and picked up their son from school. On the way, Shen Yichong tried to console Yu Yaoyao while she was having her snack. She didn’t stop her little hand from eating but then she swam deftly to cling against his arms like she had mastered Quan Yin with a thousand hands.</p>
<p>But after hearing about waking up half an hour early, her lips twitched.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t that 3:30 in the morning? Huh!</em></p>
<p>“Honey, I certainly can’t get up that time, unless tonight. You…?”</p>
<p>“Tonight, I will watch you go to bed early.” Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows and his low tone and short words instantly caused the little hands that were laying on his chest to suddenly go limp.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but find it funny and felt amused by her small gesture. “There will be plenty of time in the future.”</p>
<p>He pulled her closer to him as she sat, her skirt fell messily around her as she sank deeper against him.</p>
<p>“Don’t be impatient, sleep for now, and then tomorrow you must only think of first accomplishing the task given to you by the director the moment you are on the set.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted her lips and quickly glanced at the red lights from cars passing by outside her window and immediately stretched out and covered her eyes in frustration.</p>
<p>“Even if I am being serious, others bully me. Oh, honey, I am miserable today. I haven’t suffered this kind of bad luck ever since I was a child. Oh, that man!” She shaded her eyes, bowed her head and sobbed for the second time.</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who was seated in the front seat, turned his head at the back to glance at the couple.</p>
<p>Honestly, Yu Yaoyao walked out of the studio today still in high spirits and without the slightest expression of resentment. Earlier, the boss was so mean to the people on set that he almost angered the marketing director of Excellent Diamond. But soon, Ni Yi heard the worried voice of his boss sweet-talking Yu Yaoyao in the back seat like a baby.</p>
<p>“I’ll teach them a lesson. Don’t cry, huh?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s usually calm voice seemed to be anxious today. He was not his usual gentle self, and as of the moment he seemed even more softer than when talking to his son.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen all the videos Ni Yi sent me. We’ll send them a letter from a lawyer. And how do you want to punish them? Will you let it slip away or do something about it? I know you felt like you were disrespected. Don’t be sad, just tell me what you want and I will let someone do it.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi can tell from his eyes that he was sincere and heartbroken. Sure enough, his boss was a good person.</p>
<p>Crocker can be regarded as a big group, otherwise Chen Jiao would not want that endorsement.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was rarely spoken pleasantly by Shen Yi, had her mouth curled up and it was clear that she wasn’t happy at all. She immediately buried her small face against his firm chest, and her small hand took the chance to pinch his firm muscles that were within her reach.</p>
<p>“Honey, everyone on the internet is talking bad about me.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Yichong gritted his teeth sharply, and held her little hand tightly inside his palms. He then rubbed her back as if to calm her unsettled nerves.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath before speaking, “It’s my fault… I put so much attention and most of my energy on the affairs of the company and didn’t pay enough attention to you. Chen Jiao joined the endorsement and had a conflict with you. I didn’t know about it until this morning.’</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was held tightly by Shen Yichong that she couldn’t barely move. She gently leaned and kissed him on his chin. “My husband, I don’t blame you, I blame the enemy for being too cunning!”</p>
<p>She Yichong took a deep breath, let go of Yu Yaoyao’s hand and then clasped her chin with it.</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate that we are still in the car,” Shen Yichong told her.</p>
<p>The sound barely came out from his clenched teeth.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao grinned and looked at Ni Yi, who was sitting completely straight, like a primary school student in front of them.</p>
<p>She let Shen Yichong go, but she moved closer to him and leaned over softly, and blew warm breaths in his ear.</p>
<p>“Then I will punish you later,” she told him, “when we get out of the car, you better be ready.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s soft voice almost broke Shen Yichong’ rational string of thoughts, but soon he found what he was going to say.</p>
<p>“Give me another night.”</p>
<p>One more night, just give it to her. The glory that belongs to her!</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s beautiful eyes lit up.</p>
<p>One more night, and she was ready.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong got Ni Yi’s video and soon asked Guangxin’s public relation department to contact several familiar navy companies and got the news to catch wind.</p>
<p>Soon, <em>#Unprofessional Yu Yao Yao Playing Big Brands?</em> was posted to the hot search on the internet.</p>
