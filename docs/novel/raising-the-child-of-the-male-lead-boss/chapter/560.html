            <h3>Chapter 197 – Kissing Scene (3)</h3>
<p>Lao Zheng was the first to rush over carrying the camera. There was even a cameraman who stopped Ni Yi from speaking and shouted: “The script is here!”</p>
<p>Like a primary school student, Yu Yaoyao’s messy graffiti on her homework was about to be caught by the class teacher. But she was one step late, Zhou Lin left the director’s seat and personally went to get the script.</p>
<p>Soon, the director was able to obtain Yu Yaoyao’s script, a handful of texts that Ni Yi wanted to hide.</p>
<p>Turning over to the first page, he saw a line of recipe-like text.</p>
<p><em>Ah! I didn’t know I went to a restaurant and got the menu.</em> And soon, Zhou Lin saw the essence of the notes in the script.</p>
<p><strong>Being married – #joy, get a small pudding (lobster is also good)!#</strong></p>
<p><strong>My beloved tea set was smashed – #was robbed of a small pudding (half lobster), should be mad and angry!# </strong></p>
<p>His mouth twitched.</p>
<p>Seriously, he had been in the industry for almost half of his life, and it was the first time he had seen someone put notes on a script like this. Before, he always thought that her actions when it came to drinking and crying were only because of the live props.</p>
<p><em>But how could she think of food when it came to her performance? When did a script turn into a food menu?! </em></p>
<p>He took a deep breath, looked at Yu Yaoyao, then turned his gaze back to the script. Once the director turned to the second page, he looked for the part where the kissing scene was. Zhou Lin wanted to see how she was going to perform that. He also wanted to know her doodles for that scene. But upon reading, his face twitched once more. And Lao Zheng, the cameraman who was filming him up close holding the script, was very excited upon the unexpected expression.</p>
<p>Soon, Lao Zheng gestured, ordering the other cameramen to focus their camera lens on Shen Yichong. And not long after, he felt their strange eyes and frowned because he knew that they knew that he had already read Yu Yaoyao’s notes.</p>
<p>On their first recording of ‘My Wife and I,’ he’d supervised her remarks. At that time, she forgot how to write a word and asked him. Although she was constantly helpless, she still performed excellently whenever it came to food – compared to the time she had read out the numbers in the script. Indeed, she had improved greatly.</p>
<p>“As long as her performance was excellent and that she expresses the right emotions, there will be no problem with the remarks, Director Zhou,” Shen Yichong said and looked at Yu Yaoyao, who was surrounded by people.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao desperately wanted to get the script from the director, but she could not get it back. Seeing her so, he felt a little bothered. Thus, he stepped forward, stretched out his long arm, and took the script from Zhou Lin’s hand.</p>
<p>Zhou Lin was astonished by the man’s actions. His expression turned even more bizarre than before. But Shen Yichong was unfazed by it all.</p>
<p>“I’m old, and I can’t joke around with you like this,” Director Zhou Lin said.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…?”</p>
<p><em>What’s wrong with writing pudding in the script? Was that joking around?</em></p>
<p>His face turned stiff, and his voice cold. “Zhou Lin, she is performing seriously, as a director you should know it better.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know.” Zhou Lin smiled bitterly. “Okay, that’s it. You can go home now. Come back tomorrow at the exact same time.” After he finished, he waved his hand and turned his back. He didn’t think of looking back at them as he felt embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Shen Yichong just helped his wife. He really cares for her… Coming to the set was the right choice.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, and his eyebrows furrowed. But his eyes were then fixed on the words of the script that had immediately caught his attention.</p>
<p>But when he looked down and read her notes on the script, his chest jumped all of a sudden, and a stream of heat rushed to his face making it red. He couldn’t believe what he’d just read.</p>
<p><strong>Yu Ji was thrown to the bed by Zhou Huang – # the feeling of being disturbed while eating pudding (crossed out). Like the feeling of being thrown to the ground by Shen Yichong’s firm arms, and he pressed his muscular chest on my chest (blush).#</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zhou Huang lowered his head to kiss Yu Ji – #(crossed out) feel being kissed by Shen Yichong’s mint-flavored lips, um, it’s really delicious, ughh! My heart beats fast!# </strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>In an instant, his heart was throbbing so fast that he felt like it was about to explode!</p>
