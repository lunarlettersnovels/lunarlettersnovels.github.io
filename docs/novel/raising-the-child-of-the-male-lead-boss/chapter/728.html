            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 23 – Her Cool Husband</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’ s face was pale in the amusement park. With a hand over her mouth, she bent over and heaved unto the garbage can.</p>
<p>A tall man wearing dark sunglasses was supporting her, with a classic pink coach small handbag in his arms. Behind them stood a lovely little boy in Doraemon suit, leaning back with sunglasses on his face. He pathetically pulled on the hem of her skirt, worried and a little scared.</p>
<p>Another man, who looked like an assistant, was busy handing over paper towels and trying to pull the little bun to his side.</p>
<p>A nearby passerby had snapped a photo of this and posted it online. Following her hot search from today, it was soon crowded by netizens and rose to the 5th hot search spot. And the former hot search, which was Yu Yaoyao’s crackdown on the rumored love letters has disappeared from the top ten searches.</p>
<p>After she was done vomiting a second time in the bathroom, she went out and sat down on the nearest bench. She took a deep breath to regain her strength back before she looked at her Weibo account.</p>
<p>“Oh? The collage I posted of my selfies dropped to the 20th spot?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao held a hand over her chest sadly. “How long did it stay…merely for two hours only?”</p>
<p>“What are these new topics occupying the hot search list?” Yu Yaoyao scrolled down, her heart at the pit of her stomach. “Gan Wei’s New Drama: Su Mingjun walks for coin…  infuriated to death…”</p>
<p><i>Pah! People get bored easily with the old and get quickly enamored with new things!</i></p>
<p>Chen Lin smiled. “The microblog is the central place for internet traffic, and many people peruse the hot search list daily.” He continued, “Many companies will also use this platform to promote their new dramas or upcoming artists.”</p>
<p>“The first hot search—we didn’t buy it.” He was merely implying that someone else had done media play, buying the spot for the hot search list and squeezing her out from the top 10.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, the news by Big Fish Entertainment, who had slandered the boss’ madam was also removed from the list.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed and drank the cup with warm water handed by the little bun.</p>
<p>She hugged him and gave him a loud smack on the cheek, “Baby, Mommy will work hard! One day, I will occupy the top ten hot search list. And no one would be able to make me withdraw from it, nor can they push me down!” she declared passionately.</p>
<p>The little bun’s delicate eyebrows wrinkled, and worry twinkled in his bright, round eyes. He looked back at his dad and poked him with his chubby fingers on the arm.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt that his arm was gently touched and lowered his sight to see the little</p>
<p>bun’s pleading eyes asking for help.</p>
<p>His eyebrows, too, wrinkled.</p>
<p>“First, grow up and take care of your body before we talk about other matters.”</p>
<p>He then said, “Let’s return home.”</p>
<p>The little bun quickly nodded and followed after Shen Yichong, like a chick after its mother hen.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao admits that she was quite the scaredy-cat this time. Initially, she had wanted to try the high rides to know how it feels how to ride in the wind. Snakes do not particularly fear heights, but at tens of meters, they can’t stand the suffocation of the suddenly weightless that comes with the drop.</p>
<p>She doesn’t want to play anymore, and she doesn’t want to go up there even for money!</p>
<p>She looked back at Shen Yichong, whose stoic expression hasn’t changed one bit. Her watery eyes couldn’t help but shine with a bit of admiration.</p>
<p><i>This man is really cool!</i> She silently praised the male lead in her heart.</p>
<p>While they were on the roller coaster, not only did he refuse to scream, but he also held the Doraemon mug with one hand and the little bun in his free arm, not even holding the railing.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong noticed her sparkling eyes sneaking a glance at him from time to time. “What?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao took the other hand of the little bun and grinned. “Husband, you are super handsome today.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong：“…”</p>
