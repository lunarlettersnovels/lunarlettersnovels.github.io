            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 143 – A Nimble Thief (2)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at the group performers in embarrassment as if it was a big and challenging task. She stretched out her two slender jade arms, her red lips beckoned as she fell on his arm and groaned.</p>
<p>“Two hours, 120 minutes… 7,200 seconds…” she mumbled. “Ah! God, he must be punishing me again… how could he be so patient, so cruel, so ruthless… Since I was born, I have never stood for so much time.”</p>
<p>“Oh my God… I don’t seem to feel my legs anymore…” she added.</p>
<p>Ni Yi desperately covered his mouth so that he won’t be able to laugh out loud.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shen Yichong frowned, thinking that this woman probably can’t ever learn. He glanced at her two thin legs outlined by jeans. As of the moment, she looked as if she really has a weak appearance, which can be easily broken with a little force.</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and said, “Ni Yi, find a bench.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was unable to say anything. But in less than a minute, he said, “Sister will be filmed and might become a target by the public.”</p>
<p>It would be a terrible cost for her even to divulge on sitting down!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was silent, but his gaze was sharp, “What else do you want to do?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi snapped, and he immediately searched for a bench with a grimaced look. And so they moved to a small bench he was able to scour in the area. Yu Yaoyao sat down happily, without any hint of embarrassment.</p>
<p>Yet, even if they were now sitting, she still looks pitiful.</p>
<p>“It would be nice to have a couch similar to that of the director. It looks more comfortable to lie down in that one.” Yu Yaoyao stated.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, “Shut up and read your script.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gave a loud exhale, and then she grabbed his trousers with one hand and pulled his thigh closer to her side.</p>
<p>“Let me rely on your thighs then husband~”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was left astonished. He finally knew where his son learned to pull so incessantly on his leg trouser.</p>
<p>Other players, staff, and even the director saw Yu Yaoyao almost lying on Shen Yichong. Some of them found it hilarious, but some also felt envy. How cunning she was! But it all made others squeamish with her husband, who is a big catch!</p>
<p>His husband has immense wealth. Even if he bought a vacant lot near the film area and moved a bed to the waiting area, no one would have the guts to say anything.</p>
<p>When it was time to act, Director Zhou Qiu slightly reprimanded,</p>
<p>“There will be no player lying down afterward!” the director exclaimed. “If you don’t give me a good performance, I will give you a scolding.” He added.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s small face had been painted with dark shadows as what the role demanded, which in turn made her look less dazzling as she usually was. After hearing the director’s threats, she was not furious at all, but instead, she responded with a smile.</p>
<p>“If I perform well, can I sit on your couch later?”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu was startled with her response. “Yes, if you perform the <em>best</em> today, the director’s seat will be given to you, and I’ll sit on that bench.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong suddenly felt as if he was being suffocated. He looked at them for a while before looking coldly at the assistant Ni Yi.</p>
<p>“Is this what you taught her?”</p>
<p>Starting five years ago, Ni Yi was the agent of the rookie Yu Yaoyao before she even debuted. The matters and rules governing seniority within the entertainment industry was supposed to have been explained in clear detail by the agent to newcomers at the beginning of their trainee days.</p>
<p>Grabbing a seat from the <em>director</em>?</p>
<p>Shen Yichong watched the set a few times, and it was evident to him that Yu Yaoyao was getting better… and also bolder every day.</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s legs instantly turned to jelly, with his buttocks almost falling onto the bench. “No, no, I… am wronged, boss!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who had wanted to lie down, was already calmly standing on her set position for the scene. Her body looked frail, on the verge of falling, and she looked almost like a phantom among the people. However, when the director gave an order to the cameramen to commence, her eyes began to flash.</p>
<p>Her nimble eyes stealthily looked around, as if they seemed to have been trained for many years. She was like a ferocious beast hiding in the grass who quickly and quietly searched for her prey, staring at the people close by.</p>
<p>There was nothing reflected on her little face, but her eyes held a trace of excitement and determined concentration at the imminent thought of catching prey. She molded one among the clamor of the busy folks engrossed in their own activities.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao quietly approached the object that was supposed to be taken. Nearing with silent footfalls, her dirty, little hands soon began to reach out toward the object. Her innocent face seemed to reveal a trace of purity that of a Boddhavista. Not until a gunshot was heard that she became stunned along with everyone, her movements halting.</p>
<p>But soon, amid the noise and panic of the crowd, she nimbly reached out. She grabbed the roll of tickets from the pocket of the person next to her at lightning speed!</p>
<p>After her success, her bright eyes widened, and the expression on her face quickly merged that with the anxious crowd. Her breath and panicked expression were one with the surroundings, as she soon sunk to look like one of those obscure, ordinary passersby.</p>
<p>While filming the scene, Zhou Qiu scrutinized each frame repeatedly from behind the monitor. He found he could not take off his eyes from her all the time!</p>
<p>She was like a wild chameleon!</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao…” All of them looked at the director, who had suddenly raised his voice. Zhou Qiu’s face twitched. “Come here and get your recliner!”</p>
<p><em>Pffft!</em> Ni Yi, who was drinking a sip of water, instantly spit it out.</p>
<p>And all the people on the set were only quiet.</p>
