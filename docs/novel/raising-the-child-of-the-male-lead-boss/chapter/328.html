<p><strong>Chapter 435</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao won the Best Rookie Award.</p>
<p>YY fans celebrated in various ways. As they were afraid that the public would have a bad impression on them for spamming the others in the comment section, most of them celebrated in the official group for YY fans. M</p>
<p>Most YY fans who were paying attention to the live broadcast also found that many fangirls in the group were in a state of madness. The group was being spammed with emojis of love, hugs, and kisses. Their post was not only about Yaoyao’s awards.</p>
<p>The fans who just came from the live broadcast room were dumbfounded looking at the posts.</p>
<p><em>[Guys, I just talked to Little Bun on the phone! Angel baby bun!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Little Bun is so heart-warming…He asked me not to be sad for falling out of love because I can definitely find a better one..Gosh, I want to marry my warm Little Bun!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I really feel like stealing Little Bun back~ He asked me to go to bed early and stop working overtime because it’s not good for my health. It was so touching! I almost cried hearing that!]</em></p>
<p><em>[My baby bun! I’ve also heard his voice. He even encouraged me to keep moving so I can learn more efficiently! I must listen to him and take the physical education class I hate the most!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Baby Rui is a really warm little guy~I’m so envious of those of you whose call got through! I called but the line was always busy…]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’m also envious! What else did our baby tell you, please share with us!]</em></p>
<p><em>[By the way, did anyone record it? Ahhhhhhh, I want to hear it! My calls can’t get through!]</em></p>
<p>The fans whose call went through were sharing their experience excitedly, while the other fans were envious and jealous. Everyone was basically not in their right mind. The people who just came out of the live broadcast room were also very regretful.</p>
<p>They were so stupid. They should have called just now! Now that more and more people were calling, it was obvious to think that the chance of being connected was low. Speaking of which, the organizer of the awards ceremony was also lucky, since their call was able to get through the phone among the crowd of fanatic fans.</p>
<p>Little Bun appeared in the organizer’s live broadcast once again. This time, the video call even allowed everyone to see the hospital wall behind him and the nurses coming and going.</p>
<p>Of course, Little Bun was still very sensible. He was sitting on a chair obediently thanking everyone. Unlike just now, he didn’t sell himself this time.</p>
<p>Since he received a lot of calls just now, that should indicate that all the uncles and aunties have written down his number.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhuan from ‘Chaos’, who received the award on Yu Yaoyao’s behalf took the call next. He had been close with Shen Yi Chong and had also met Little Bun and chatted with him. He had always had experience dealing with children given his age, and he had children who were about to attend college.</p>
<p>“Xiao Rui, how is your mommy?” Zhou Zhuan asked a question that everyone cared about, and YY fans were very grateful to him.</p>
<p>Little Bun shook his head, “She hasn’t come out yet.” He squeezed his mouth, looking like he was about to cry. His big black eyes were a little watery.</p>
<p>This look hurt the fans who were watching the live broadcast.</p>
<p><em>[Little Bun…. Aw, he’s so worried about Mommy, but he still comforted me just now.]</em></p>
<p><em>[I want to hold Little Bun and touch his head! Don’t be sad, all of us are here with you.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Don’t be afraid Little Bun! My mother is an obstetrician and gynecologist. If anything, I’ll seek my mother’s help!]</em></p>
<p><em>[My brother-in-law is also in obstetrics and gynecology. I’ll call him to ask!]</em></p>
<p><em>[ I have a sister-in-law who is the director of the obstetrics and gynecology department. I’ll go ask how long it’ll take to give birth to a baby!]</em></p>
<p>The group of fans were very helpful. Looking at the comments, it seemed like they had mobilized all the strength of the hospital staff in the obstetrics and gynecology section.</p>
<p>Little Bun couldn’t see the comment, but he was comforted by Director Zhou Zhuan.</p>
<p>“It’s normal. Xiao Rui, don’t worry. You can watch uncle’s movie while you wait. Maybe your sister will be born right after you finish watching.”</p>
<p>The award ceremony would last more than 2 hours, and a movie would last around 2 hours…</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wasn’t giving birth to her first child. The process should be faster theoretically.</p>
<p>If one movie can’t do the work, he also had several of them. Since his debut, there have been four or five nominations for his work. After doing quick calculations, Zhou Zhuan coaxed Shen Rui.</p>
<p>Shen Rui nodded immediately.</p>
<p>The phone was quickly hung up.</p>
<p>His face which was holding back his tears conquered the hearts of a group of old aunts.</p>
<p>The people who called Ni Yi before were all younger girls with hot-headed and bolder minds. The slightly older and more mature office workers and housewives did not call the number. But now… the situation was quite the opposite.</p>
<p>In the YY fan group, the topic of #callingLittleBun suddenly changed. The fans were all seeking guidance on how to appease children!</p>
<p>Even Ye Yun, the vice-president of the fan club, voiced out, “Please stop calling Ni Yi’s work number anymore. Are there any kindergarten teachers and preschool teachers in our group? Or do we have any experts in child psychology and early education? If yes, please call Little Bun. Please do so to soothe his uneasy emotions.”</p>
<p>There appeared to be people who were professionals in these fields. They enthusiastically signed up for the task. After some organization, a child psychology researcher with more than ten years of experience , who was also the mother to a pair of twin daughters, called Shen Rui.</p>
