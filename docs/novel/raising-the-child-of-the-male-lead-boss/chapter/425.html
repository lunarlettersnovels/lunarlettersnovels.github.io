            <p><strong>Chapter 338 – Shame Comes After Anger (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Now, many people on the internet were praising her acting skills. Even he himself had watched a few animated pictures and videos of her acting. He had to admit that she had made great progress. The emotions needed for the drama were now alive in her eyes.</p>
<p>But he never expected that she would come to shoot the cover of ‘Beauty’ when she had only just found her fame.</p>
<p>He and a few assistants had spent days preparing for this shooting. He had never expected her to be participating. When he’d gotten the news, he’d felt the fear and anger that his efforts of so many days would go to waste.</p>
<p>He had only been venting on his secondary account on Weibo. He never expected to be so harshly criticized by fans. He felt terribly wronged.</p>
<p>“Everyone, get ready. I will start adjusting my cameras now,” Hu Yiwei said as he forced himself to calm down. He clicked the shutter several times to take test photos of the sets, and looked down to check the results.</p>
<p>The theme of the first set was steel and cement.</p>
<p>He had personally found the iron fences and chemical tanks in some abandoned factories. The background wall was spray-painted in dark tones of gray, black and brown to further enhance the effect.</p>
<p>“That light goes a little further off to the right,” Hu Yiwei said as he examined the set for any last-minute adjustments.</p>
<p>It would have been a perfect fit if the supermodels he’d wanted for the shoot were here. They were nothing like the actresses who could only portray sweet or sexy… There were two completely different standards!</p>
<p>Photoshoots took a certain amount of skill that only models had! This thought irritated him.</p>
<p>“Is Yu Yaoyao not ready yet? Little Le, go inside and see if…” Hu Yiwei’s sentence dwindled off when he looked off to the side.</p>
<p>A group of people were crowding in the shooting area. But the woman walking in the middle was undoubtedly the most eye-catching!</p>
<p>From a distance, it was almost impossible to see Yu Yaoyao’s beauty and exquisite facial features. One could only vaguely see the bumpy curves of her beautiful body; her figure was near perfect with hardly a trace of fat. She was wearing a gray camisole that clearly showed off her curves. Over this, she wore a large white shirt into which holes had been ripped. This served to add a trace of laziness and desolation. The outfit was paired with black denim hot pants that allowed her to show off her slender, and surprisingly fair legs to the crew.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei squinted. He didn’t like that she was so beautiful. He felt that her beauty was so ordinary that she didn’t even stand out in a crowd. Even when they’d met earlier; he had been quite displeased by how fair her skin was. It was the total opposite of what he needed for today’s shooting. She would be more relevant to the theme if she had a honey-colored, healthy-looking complexion! However, her pale, bright complexion created a striking contrast with the pure black, gray, and white she was wearing.</p>
<p>The impact of the sight was so violent that Hu Yiwei felt his heart pinch.</p>
<p>“Good luck, Mommy!” a childish voice rang out as the group approached.</p>
<p>The shrill sound brought Hu Yiwei back to reality. As he came back to his senses, the look of desolation on his face disappeared to be replaced with snide sarcasm.</p>
<p>She had already been unprofessional five years ago, and now she was bringing her son to work? Clearly, she wasn’t serious about this at all!</p>
<p>Ni Yi had already spoken to Ken, the person in charge, beforehand. He had explained that they had no choice but to bring the child with them, because there was no one else at home. He had promised that he would not disturb anyone’s work.</p>
<p>But Hu Yiwei scoffed at this statement. Everyone had children, she was not special. The child was on holiday while his parents had to work. Which family was not like that? If everyone brought their child to work, how were people supposed to get anything done? They might as well have run a kindergarten instead of taking pictures!</p>
<p>“Be good. You wait here with Little Yiyi. Mommy will be done in a minute!” Yu Yaoyao said to her son before handing him to Ni Yi. One she was settled; she turned her head towards the camera. “Alright. How do you want to shoot this?”</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei snorted softly, “Go stand near the background, stick your face out from behind the barbed wire. The expression I want is that feeling of standing in an abandoned place, not in a backyard. Your face should be cold, but there should also be a trace of…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao walked over before he even finished speaking. She stretched out her hand and grabbed her hair. She tugged it back and revealed her smooth forehead then casually tilted her delicate face. She parted her red lips slightly and her large, watery eyes held the air of indifference and laziness. She looked like a laid back, sarcastic person who had experienced everything life had to offer.</p>
<p>Her stare was as cold as ice but as firm as a sword. And it was stabbing directly at Hu Yiwei.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei was taken aback, but he subconsciously pressed the shutter.</p>
<p>Her long fair legs looked like the last trace of purity in the abandoned place filled with heavy metal.</p>
<p>“Like this?” Yu Yaoyao lowered her head slightly and a strand of hair slipped from behind her ear.</p>
<p>She suddenly came alive with the aura of wild beauty.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei swallowed hard.</p>
