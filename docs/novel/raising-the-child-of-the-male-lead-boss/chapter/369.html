<p><strong>Chapter 394</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>“Let’s have someone as a back-up, just in case,” Ni Yi suggested. “After all, she’s a lady. Just in case she’s in her menstrual cycle during one of those scenes.”</p>
<p>“That works too.” Liang Yujie nodded. “I’ll get someone to look for a substitute with a similar body shape.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao couldn’t help but pout when they didn’t believe her.</p>
<p>When she got home, she clung onto Shen Yichong and told him all about her heroic deeds.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had many documents he needed to deal with. So, he listened silently to her talk as he worked. He even frowned from time to time.</p>
<p>“Did you have a fight with the birds?” he asked cautiously</p>
<p>“Yes, there were no birds that were not afraid of me! They all fled the moment I looked up!” she said excitedly.</p>
<p>“Oh… Impressive.”</p>
<p>“Of course! Today, Director Liang also asked me if I had ever killed a chicken. Hah! The bones of the chickens I’ve eaten can be piled up into mountains!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pinched his eyebrows, then reached out to touch her head. It was true, their supply of fresh and frozen chicken to their home had never been cut off.</p>
<p>“Right. Eat more. We have plenty.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded with a smile.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>That evening, the Public Relations Department of Guangxin announced Yu Yaoyao’s acceptance to join the movie ‘I’m A Killer’, which was expected to be released by the end of the year.</p>
<p>YY fans were very excited, although there were also some that asked if the plan to have a second child had been put on hold.</p>
<p>Chen Lin’s urgent call arrived just as the news hit the hot search. “Boss, several reporters approached me and asked about the divorce agreement between you and your wife back then. I suspect it’s Master Lee who sold the news…” Chen Lin quickly explained. “Although it’s not on the hot search now, someone has posted it on Weibo. It’s only a matter of time until it reaches there.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squinted his eyes and said he wouldn’t be spending money to stop the rumors from spreading. Then, he hung up the phone and continued to make a second baby with Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao put her arms around him and raised her hazy eyes to him. “Did Gangster Chen do this?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong kissed her. “I don’t know. But probably yes. Don’t worry, ‘Wife’ will be broadcasted tomorrow. You don’t need to think about this today.” Then, he turned off the bedside lamp.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chen Jiao was furious when he got the news.</p>
<p>He called Guo Li immediately, “He leaked the news to the others? Didn’t he say it’s going to be exclusive?”</p>
<p>He just threatened Shen Yichong with this, and Yu Yaoyao had overheard the entire thing. Now it was on the hot search only a few days after it had happened. Everyone was going to think it was him who sold the news to reporters!</p>
<p>This man was going to land him in huge trouble!</p>
<p>“Guo Li, get someone for me. Pay to stop the news from spreading. Don’t use our company account, and don’t use your own account! I don’t care how much it costs. Bring the hot search down. Now!” Chen Jiao seethed.</p>
<p>Guo Li had always been an efficient worker. Within almost half an hour, the steadily rising hot search was quickly silenced.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao breathed a sigh of relief. He prayed that Yu Yaoyao would not know about this so there would be no misunderstandings.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao woke the next day, she looked for the hot search but couldn’t find it.</p>
<p>When she learned from Shen Yichong that it was very likely Chen Jiao who was the one behind the disappearance, she laughed out loud. “Darling, do you think he’s going to be pissed off tonight?”</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth rose in a smile. “Most likely yes.”</p>
<p>They were not wrong at all.</p>
<p>That night, Chen Jiao deliberately watched the broadcast of the last episode of ‘Wife’. He wanted to verify that they were only acting as a loving couple, but he never could have expected the devastating blow he got.</p>
<p>In the first five minutes of the episode, the director team went to the gift-giving section.</p>
<p>During the filming of the first episode of ‘Wife’, every husband was secretly informed by the program team that they would have to prepare a gift for their wives to send out in the last episode. The gift Shen Yichong gave Yu Yaoyao in the last episode made Chen Jiao furious all over again.</p>
<p>“My wife once said on the show that many people misunderstood her, thinking that her livelihood revolves around me. And because of this, she has suffered quite a lot of criticism. But while recording ‘Wife’, I was criticized by so many people. She was the one who always supported me, and her smile brought so much joy and happiness to our family. I thank this show for showing me that my wife is irreplaceable. Taking advantage of the last episode, I would like to give her a gift that will deter any future criticism. And that gift is all the assets under my name. I’m transferring all of them to my wife, including Guangxin’s shares,” Shen Yichong announced.</p>
<p>The crew of the show got a close-up of the words written on the transfer agreement page. In addition, they showed the pictures of notarization by the lawyers and by the Bureau of Commerce.</p>
<p>It was not an act!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had become a wealthy woman literally overnight!</p>
<p>“I didn’t believe in her at one stage, and we did the premarital property notarization, just like many people do. I even made an agreement with her that if we ever got divorced, she would only get some of the assets. But from now on…If we ever get divorced, I’ll be the one to leave the marriage with nothing. I’ll be the one relying on my rich wife for my livelihood.” Shen Yichong gave a calm, gentle, happy smile to the audience.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s expression wrinkled in fury.</p>
<p>For him, this sentence was simply ironic!</p>
<p>Was he now a joke for threatening Shen Yichong with their divorce agreement before?</p>
<p>The real estate transfers and equity transfers were definitely not something that could be completed in a few days. That meant that Shen Yichong had been dealing with these for months already!</p>
<p>It was impossible for him to divorce Yu Yaoyao!</p>
<p>They did have feelings for each other!</p>
<p>He even spent money that morning to help them suppress the hot search regarding their divorce agreements!</p>
<p>Chen Jiao shot to his feet and kicked angrily at the coffee table in front of him.</p>
