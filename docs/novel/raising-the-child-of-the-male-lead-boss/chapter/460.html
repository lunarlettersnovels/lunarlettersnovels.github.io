<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 303 – Digging A Pit (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Yu Xinjie’s hand shook in anger, and she nearly flung the phone away. In the tabloid article, there was a photo of Yu Yaoyao sobbing into her hands. She had a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>There was no way Yu Yaoyao would reveal to the reporters about the money. Even if she did, she didn’t have concrete evidence to support her claims. She could never prove whether the money was given willingly, or she was coerced. And it would garner negative exposure for her as an actress. Yu Yaoyao wasn’t stupid. So, what was she planning? Was she adamant to drag them all down since she was going down?</p>
<p>Her sister had always been timid and afraid. She had always been high on maintaining a good image of herself as well as those around her. So how did she expose them to the reporters, knowing this would make jarring headlines everywhere? Could it be that they pushed her too much and too quickly that she caved under the pressure and babbled everything?</p>
<p>“Xinjie!” exclaimed Zhao Mei, “Is this from your sister?” She had seen the article too. Her voice was becoming shriller under panic. “Did she confess to the reporters?”</p>
<p>“Mummy,” said Yu Xinjie, squeezing Zhao Mei’s arm trying to calm her down. “Don’t panic. She has no evidence! The bank card that was given by brother-in-law’s secretary is with me. Only I know the PIN, there is no way they can extract the records.”</p>
<p>Yu Yoaoyao had been a third-rate actress, without a job. She had stayed at home, being depressed all year round. But Shen Yichong had taken care of her from the beginning of their marriage, to their quarrels to the possibility of a divorce. He had given her an allowance of 50,000 bucks. The money Yu Yaoyao didn’t spend, she transferred it to them. It had amounted to 600,000 bucks in a year and Yu Xinjie had been too happy about it. She had still been in high school and her father wasn’t well-off to give her much pocket money.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie and her mother had coaxed Yu Yaoyao into giving them the money. She had flattered Yu Yaoyao and made her feel guilty for not providing for her family. Yu Yaoyao eventually had grown so tired that she had given them her debit card to do as they pleased. At once, Yu Xinjie had changed the password. She had coaxed Yu Yaoyao to ask Shen Yichong for a larger amount of monthly allowance.</p>
<p>“Mummy, don’t panic,” said Yu Xinjie,  “Every time Yu Yaoyao asked brother-in-law for money, it was wired to the account that the debit card was attached to. That was Yu Yaoyao’s account and she didn’t know the password so she never could withdraw the money. So even if she had the transaction record, it would only show money flooding into her account and not really being transferred anywhere. So, it’s alright. She doesn’t have any concrete proof.” Yu Xinjie was trying to comfort Zhao Mei as much as herself.</p>
<p>The bank account requires a password to be accessed. Wait! Could it be that Yu Yaoyao already went to the bank with her identity documents and changed the password? But that couldn’t be! Yu Xinjie’s heart raced. She had just used the card to make a payment last month. The password was the same. Besides, when she used the money to buy properties or luxury goods, she never transferred it to her account but used it directly from Yu Yaoyao’s account. There would be no transfer records. She calmed herself and clicked on the link to the tabloid article:</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>‘The actress who married into a wealthy family is suspected of being sucked dry of blood by her maiden family all the year round!’</em></p>
<p><em>In the five-minute exclusive interview, Yu Yaoyao had broken down in tears. She couldn’t believe that her mother and sister, whom she had worked so hard to support over the past five years, would think she was unfilial.</em></p>
<p><em>She showed the reporter her ownership records. As a full-time wife, she had no financial resources except for her husband.</em></p>
<p><em>However, a large amount of expenditures occurred on her bank account, mostly for real estate purchases, beauty salon decoration, equipment purchases, etc., with an expenditure totaling to about 20 million.</em></p>
<p><em>At present, according to the reporter’s investigation, except for her husband’s house before marriage, Yu Yaoyao does not have any real estate or vehicles under her personal name. But her younger sister and her mother have private properties worth tens of millions of dollars. Five years ago, Yu’s mother opened a beauty salon spanning an area of ​​more than 200 square meters right in the middle of the city center. The payment for said properties shows indications of being carried out entirely through Yu Yaoyao’s bank account, and matches the records reflecting upon said account’s transfer records over the past 5 years. The amounts match. (It is reported that in the public financial turnover statements of Yu Trade, the profit in the past three years has been less than one million).</em></p>
<p><em>Attached below is an exclusive interview recording with the famed actress and wife of the reputed President of Guangxin, Yu Yaoyao herself.</em></p>
<p><em>Reporter: Why don’t you go home to visit your maiden family?</em></p>
<p><em>YYY: … (Crying)</em></p>
<p><em>Reporter: Is there more to the story, Ms. Yu.</em></p>
<p><em>YYY: Could you please not write about it? It won’t be good for me as well as my mother and my sister (muffled sniffles/noises)</em></p>
<p><em>The reporter asked again, but it was suspected that Yu Yaoyao’s husband, Shen Yichong, tried to put an end to the interview.</em></p>
<p><em>YYY: Honey, take our son and go to the next room for a while. I am fine, really, my dear. This is an issue with my mother and sister, I will solve it on my own.”</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yu Xinjie read everything till the end. Her hands were shaking. Her eyes and face was red. The glass in Zhao Mei’s hand fell to the ground and shattered.</p>
<p>“Xinjie,” she cried, “You said she had no evidence!”</p>
<p>Zhao Mei’s face seemed to age before her eyes. Her anxiety completely changed her demeanor. She pointed to the report with trembling fingers.</p>
<p>“Mummy, it’s alright,” said Yu Xinjie, “They don’t have evidence. This is just an article with speculations. Although it might be true that Dad had not made good earning in recent years, but we can still claim that whatever we bought, we bought from his savings from before. We can still claim it was his money we used.”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie kept her voice calm, but her hands trembled and squeezed her phone in panic. She took deep breaths and clenched her fist. “They are just making empty speculations, Mummy,” said Yu Xinjie, “Tabloid reports aren’t legal evidence. The article is only talking about the current market value of the house. The house price had doubled over the years. We didn’t use that much money; it was only a little over ten million yen….” Her voice trailed off as she remembered with more panic that the rest of the money was invested on Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>In order to frame Yu Yaoyao of being unfaithful to her marriage, it had been necessary to invest money on Chen Jiao. She had wanted to both destroy Yu Yaoyao’s marriage as well as steal Chen Jiao for herself.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie gritted her teeth, scrolled to the end of the article and listened to the recording again. After hearing it again, she became bitter and angry.</p>
<p>“Mummy, I will call her now,” she said angrily and dialed Yu Yaoyao’s number.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie took a deep breath as the call rang. Did she really dare expose everything? She just couldn’t believe it. She didn’t expect Yu Yaoyao to pick her call. Whenever she called, Yu Yaoyao had always ignored her calls but this time, the consistent ring of the call stopped as Yu Yaoyao picked the call on the other side.</p>
