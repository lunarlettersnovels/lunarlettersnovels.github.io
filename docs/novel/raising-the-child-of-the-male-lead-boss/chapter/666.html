            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 85 – Behind Closed Doors </strong></p>
<p>“Dad, help mommy take a bath and don’t forget to feed her meals!” The steamed bun anxiously poked his head from out of Yu Yaoyao arms, giving his father a pointed stare.</p>
<p>“Mommy must be hungry. I ate egg rolls this afternoon and now I’m also hungry.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong wanted nothing more than to massage his throbbing temples.</p>
<p>“Dad, hurry up. You fed mommy so slowly yesterday—do it faster today!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi opened his mouth in surprise watching this spectacle before him. He had always thought that his sister back on stage before was joking about her inspiration for her acting skills. She said she was able to perform well because of love, and not of talent…it turns out to be true!</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s eyes glanced at Yu Yaoyao, then secretly looked at the big boss Shen, whose face was like the arctic ocean.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but shudder. <em>It seems that the boss only looks cold on the outside, but is actually a caring man inside…so he is actually the slave of his wife behind closed doors?</em></p>
<p>This was too big of a secret!</p>
<p>“Okay! I will go now. Sister Yu, boss, call me if you need anything!” Ni Yi hurriedly fled in despair.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was still cuddling the steamed bun in her arms. She was in a good mood, as if her soul was about to fly. She momentarily turned to look at the profusely sweating Ni Yi.</p>
<p>Her manager also had it hard today. He stayed with her all the time, not even able to eat a proper meal since the start of the filming.</p>
<p>“Stay for dinner, so that your stomach won’t grumble on the way.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s body shook. He instantly felt a cold biting wind served with ice flakes, piercing his neck straight from behind. He sneakily cast a glance towards the hall where the big boss was ominously standing. With his legs like jelly, he made his was for the sofa, intending to take his bag.</p>
<p>“Eat? Oh, no, no…I won’t eat.”</p>
<p>Stay and watch the boss feed his wife? Or stay and watch the boss bathe her wife?</p>
<p><em>Am I asking for death?</em></p>
<p>Ni Yi did not look back. He grabbed the bag in a vice grip and ran away quickly, “Elder sister, I’ll send you a text message later. I’ll come to pick you up again the same time!” he said as he slammed the door shut.</p>
<p>The small steamed bun somewhat felt complicated, looking at the door. It was because he wasn’t able to tell his uncle Ni Yi to take good care of his mommy.</p>
<p><em>Ah, what a pity! </em>As he thought dejectedly, he bulged his cheeks and looked at his father, who was still standing on one side. His small shoulders drooped feebly at this sight.</p>
<p>His dad really doesn’t know how to get up and help. To even move at a fast pace is already a chore to him!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at his son’s resentful face and frowned. While Yu Yaoyao instantly cooperated with the steamed bun, lying on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Husband, I’m going to beg you today again…” Holding her right hand, she whispered pitifully, “I still can’t wash my hands before meals.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the little steamed bun immediately nodded his head and supplied, “Yes, you must first wash your hands before you eat. But mommy can’t wash hers. So, when dad is finished washing his hands, he should feed mommy next.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong only felt his blood rise to his temples.</p>
<p>“Dad, you promised me yesterday. Are you going back on your word? What a coward.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Yu Yaoyao was enjoying a treatment supposed to be on her pension in advance.</p>
<p>“I want to eat wax gourd–no onion. Also braised pork, one that doesn’t have fat in it. And then rice layered with some, um, braised meat sauce on the top.”</p>
<p>“Dad, give mommy some green vegetables too. You also forgot to serve mommy soup again today!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had his sleeves rolled up, carrying a rice bowl with a dark face. And while feeding, he was commanded by both mother and son.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ni Yi had suddenly received a notice from the program’s directors and came back to announce this new information. He was able to see this amazing scene as soon as he entered.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s side face was hidden under the dim lighting of the living room, but the spoon held in his hand was clearly feeding Yu Yaoyao’s small mouth. The movement looked slow and precise—almost even gentle. However, Yu Yaoyao held out her small tongue from time to time, liking the spoon clean of the sauce remaining.</p>
<p>The little steamed bun was sitting on the sofa, holding her right hand in his hand and talking, directing his father to operate the next feeding action.</p>
<p><em>This scene…is too spicy for the eyes!</em></p>
