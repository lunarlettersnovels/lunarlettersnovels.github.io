            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 146 – Start of the Family Reality Show (1)</strong></p>
<p>When Shen Yichong saw his son run to his mother’s embrace, he suddenly felt warm. Seeing how he tightly clung on to Yu Yaoyao, like he hadn’t seen his mother for so long, was indeed very moving. This picturesque family scene commanded everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>When the little bun darted towards Yu Yaoyao, many caught a glimpse of his cherubic face. He had fully inherited the characteristics of his father and the facial features of his mother. Young as he was, he was still a little plump around the face. But when he grows up, he might become the most handsome, stoic fellow who would leave a million girls yearning.</p>
<p>“CEO Shen, if there happens to be a parent-child variety show in the future, I will contact and invite you as soon as possible. You must consider it.”</p>
<p>“My drama is missing a child star. CEO Shen, would you consider letting your son make an appearance?”</p>
<p>“Oh, he’s so cute! Look at his small face…”</p>
<p>“Very beautiful genes, ah, I’m jealous!”</p>
<p>Although they were terrified of him, the production crew and staff bravely came closer and in an instant, surrounded them. The little bun raised his head slowly and gave everyone a shy glance.</p>
<p>He softly said his hellos to his uncle and aunt, and even though his face looked cute, Shen Yichong was still able to persuade the staff.</p>
<p>“Director, please leave us.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Yu Yaoyao and his son had already posed in front of the camera, waiting for the photographer to take pictures, Shen Yichong directly picked up his son, breaking the mother and son’s affection and pressed the little bun’s face against his chest blocking the angle of the shot.</p>
<p>The little bun looked up but was held down by his father. Even Yu Yaoyao who wanted to pose was grabbed by him with the other hand.</p>
<p><em>A big one and a small one, it’s just a matter of course!</em></p>
<p>“Don’t interrupt the crew’s next filming, you’re going to have time to participate in other programs again.”</p>
<p>After reprimanding the two, Shen Yichong escorted them directly to the car, leaving Ni Yi behind to manage everything. When they got to the car, he pulled the door and isolated themselves from the sight of the cameras outside. Shen Yichong then released the little bun. Looking at the mad face of his son, he couldn’t help but sigh.</p>
<p>“I thought dad told you last night that there are lots of bad people out there. You are young and I don’t want you to be seen by the public so early.”</p>
<p>“But… we owe you photos so we want to make it up to you in another way.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong furrowed his brow while Yu Yaoyao looked curiously at them without interrupting.</p>
<p>“Dad will take you and your mom to a family photoshoot and then we will frame the photos at home. Is it all right to hang them up in your room and in the playroom?” Shen Yichong said and patted the head of his son.</p>
<p>Little bun refused at first but when he heard him, his mouth rose slightly. As the saying goes, strive for the same target and you’re going to accomplish it. There may be struggles but hitting the target is worth it.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at his son and smiled. “We will take pictures this weekend and we will bring them home that day.” The little bun immediately closed his mouth and nodded heavily while holding the big, white snake plushie. But his dark eyes flushed and his small hand silently grabbed Yu Yaoyao’s clothes.</p>
<p><em>One day, I am going to be on TV! I will achieve that!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>“In the Limelight” was wrapped with the final three episodes getting done in one breath.</p>
<p>A new program had officially started filming at the beginning of the year, and the TV station had finally selected a group of cinematographers and staff for the large variety show “My Wife and I”.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who didn’t want to reveal his address directly asked the housekeeper to clean up a single-family villa in the suburbs to be used for the recording. He took Yu Yaoyao and his son in advance, as well as the especially taken family photos that were hung on the walls of each room.</p>
<p>On the day of the filming, the director’s group came at seven in the morning and greeted each other. The premise saw a deluge of photographers, drones hovering over the villa for aerial shots and whatnot. Mountains and lakes made for a scenic setting around this small villa demanding the extra effort to capture it all.</p>
<p>A tyrant, no matter which angle they look at, will always be a tyrant!</p>
<p>Everyone in the production crew knew that Shen Yichong was wealthy, this place was clear proof.</p>
<p>Director Zhou Qiu personally went to the door and knocked. Four cameramen were also waiting at the door, ready to record.</p>
<p>The main agenda of the variety show “My Wife and I” was to showcase the lifestyle of a star couple. So, they arrived an hour earlier than what was scheduled because they wanted to capture the most realistic, honest and private aspects of the couple’s life.</p>
<p>In the anticipation of everyone, the door finally creaked open revealing the very tall Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>He appeared to have just gotten out of the shower, his ever neat and meticulous black hair was slightly messy as water dripped from the tips. He wore a pure black bathrobe, and looked like he did not wear anything else than such color.</p>
<p>Director Zhou Qiu was stunned at the first glance.</p>
<p>During the weekdays, Boss Shen wore his suit and when he was at home he had a daily sense of a beautiful man.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, we arrived a little too early, uhmm, uhmm, I was just thinking about starting early and being able to finish the work ahead of time. Are you all up?”</p>
<p>Director Qiu was obviously lying. The cameras were all on, so it was obvious that they were already recording him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was at home and obviously didn’t want his morning ruined. But despite the abruptness, he held his cool and opened the door completely and let them in.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Director Zhou,” he greeted. “Sorry, my wife isn’t up yet. So please come in first and wait for a while.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong bent over and took the guest slippers for everyone. They were shocked.</p>
<p>“My wife is a light sleeper and my child is still asleep,” he explained.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu got the hint and nodded immediately, the production staff walked inside quietly.</p>
