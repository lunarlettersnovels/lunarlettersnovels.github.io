            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 16 – Let The Director Become A Little Clear-Headed (4)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wore a <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://m.lx-print.com/images/TB1gLrAJpXXXXa3XVXXXXXXXXXX_!!0-item_pic.jpg_360x360.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://m.lx-print.com/jingpin_521875070400.html&amp;h=360&amp;w=360&amp;tbnid=nYsBwYyT5AH12M&amp;tbnh=225&amp;tbnw=225&amp;usg=AI4_-kREtCoU9xC-e5o-I0uYqaH4pwpzIw&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=wWGPlZuXZjWyVM&amp;hl=en">Doraemon shawl</a> over her shoulders to partner with the little bun. Underneath it, she wore a reddish-purple, knee-length, side slit skirt that emphasized her curves and a shoulder-length, fit, black blouse to compliment it.</p>
<p>When she walked, she swayed her hips sensually. And as she walked over to the father and son pair, she took the other free hand of the little bun.</p>
<p>From behind, one would gush over this beautiful display of parent-child costume pairing.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked back at Ni Yi before they went out. “By the way, Little Yiyi, you send a message to my dear sister that I have been in poor health lately. I’ll get in touch with her soon.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi nodded and watched the three of them leave his sight.</p>
<p>They went inside a parked BMW. The little bun sat between Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao, playing intently a jigsaw puzzle game on his small tablet.</p>
<p>Chen Lin sat in the front before handing them the agreement in duplicate.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao took it, looked at it, and smiled.</p>
<p><i>— Gift Contract. </i></p>
<p><i>This agreement shall take effect only after 24 months following the divorce of Party A (Yu Yaoyao) and Party B (Shen Yichong).</i></p>
<ol>
<li><i>Party B shall present Party A with the villas no. 293 at Jianyu Road, no. 34 at the Western District and shop No. 34-37 in Dahe Road, with a license of **… and vehicles, with approximately total to 126 million.</i></li>
<li><i>From now on, if Party A has any incidents (i.e. rumors, cheating scandals, etc.) that are detrimental to both parties and their families, Party B shall be compensated for a single fee of 5 million after 24 months. </i></li>
<li><i>Within 24 months, Party A and Party B shall fulfill their parental responsibilities and maintain the image of husband and wife in front of their child and the outside world. </i></li>
</ol>
<p><i>In the event of a violation, the other party is compensated for a single fee of 5 million. </i></p>
<p>It was a bit of a struggle to read the complex words, but Yu Yaoyao still understood the basics. Therefore, she did not hesitate to pen her signature on the last page.</p>
<p>That day, in the ward, she and Shen Yichong had reached an agreement in front of a lawyer.</p>
<p>She got two years! Enough for her to take this man’s heart!</p>
<p>After signing the form, Yu Yaoyao handed it to the imposing man beside her with glistening eyes. “Thank you so much, dear.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stopped writing.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao accidentally touched him and quickly retracted her hand. She closed her eyes with a smile.</p>
<p><i>Oh, there is no human she cannot conquer.</i> <i>Just wait and see! </i></p>
<p>But who would have thought that her cell phone would ring as soon as the car was only five hundred meters away?</p>
<p>“Hey, Little Yiyi.”</p>
<p>“Sister, Sister! Oh, it’s over!”</p>
<p>She incidentally put the call on speaker and Ni Yi’s panicked voice immediately spread inside the car.</p>
<p>“You said you didn’t cheat and made me ignore the scandal threatened by that journalist! Now he became so angry that he just exposed the love letter you wrote for Chen Jiao! It’s been retweeted more than 10,000 times. I think it’s going to be a hot search!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao said, his face immediately flushed, “Is that really true? I’m going to be on the hot search again?”</p>
<p>However, in the next second, her voice took an ecstatic tone. “Did the journalist have a shot of me? Did he put it up with a beautiful picture of me? Be sure to ask him to add a picture of me!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “… What?”</p>
<p>Chen Lin: “…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong crumbled up the papers in his hand.</p>
