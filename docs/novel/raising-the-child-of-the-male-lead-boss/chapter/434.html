            <p><strong>Chapter 329 – Learning Experience (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Qi Hang pretended not to hear what Wei Ming said and continued shamelessly. “Our actresses are spectacular. I want you to look at yourselves. I always have to make you redo your scenes. Right? How does that make you feel?”</p>
<p>The male lead, Lu Cheng, frowned. He had obviously not heard a word that had been said. He was still immersed in his own surprise. “I have long heard that Yu Yaoyao’s acting skills are very good, not to mention her stunning appearance. Today, when I finally saw it for myself… I admire her. How old is she? No, how many scenes has she done? How many major roles has she had? How can she be so outstanding?” Lu Cheng was younger than Wei Ming, but his maturity and stubble made him seem like a man in his early forties.</p>
<p>He originally thought that his acting skills were outstanding, and that he was an underrated “best actor”. He thought that he just didn’t have the chance to compete against the actors who had many online fans. But today, he had finally learned that there were also exceptionally talented people among these actors!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was so amazing!</p>
<p>Lu Cheng shook his head.</p>
<p>Smoking scenes were very common in many male roles. Since his early twenties, he had played over a dozen roles in which he smoked, due to his mature look. Looking back, he hadn’t been able to express such layered feelings as Yu Yaoyao had been able to when he was her age! And he knew she wasn’t a smoker just by looking at the camera.</p>
<p>A young and beautiful woman who could make herself look like a decadent middle-aged woman just in one scene… She had an immense amount of talent.</p>
<p>Wei Ming understood his thoughts when he saw Lu Cheng’s dizzy expression. His old face relaxed a little and he seemed relieved. Finally, he wasn’t the only one in the crew who had received a blow.</p>
<p>Director Qi Hang usually treated men and women equally, though he especially admired powerful actors. Now, his preference was obvious.</p>
<p>“Go think about how to break your boundaries,” he said. “If you really can’t think of anything, take this as a learning experience. Even a wife from a wealthy family can perform such a natural and profound feeling of being pressured by life. What’s the matter with you guys? Wei Ming, Lu Cheng, go and ask her. Don’t be ashamed. We will fight for passes in one shot too.”</p>
<p>The two actors were sent directly to the actress’ dressing room. Wei Ming and Lu Cheng smiled sheepishly at each other. They both desperately wanted to play their roles better and were convinced of Yu Yaoyao’s acting talents. They cheered each other up and headed bravely to their destination.</p>
<p>As a person with more experience, Wei Ming had to lighten Lu Cheng’s mood. “Little Lu,” he said, “did you graduate from the Chinese Opera? Did you study acting?”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng was stunned, “I am actually more experienced in drama. I have worked with Director Qi before, that is why he asked me this time.” He wasn’t certain why Wei Ming was asking questions.</p>
<p>Wei Ming quickly patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>After they had knocked on the door, they entered. As a junior, Lu Cheng walked behind Wei Ming. When they entered, Lu Cheng was shocked once again.</p>
<p>Sister Cai, who was usually very reserved and cold, was chewing chicken feet in the room. There was even a chili flake on the side of her mouth.</p>
<p>He pretended that he hadn’t seen it, and he got straight to the point, “Sister Cai, Little Yu, the director sent us over. He asked us to learn more from you. He wanted us to learn how we can have the scenes passed in one shot. Well, especially from…” As Lu Cheng spoke, he looked at Yu Yaoyao, who was having her makeup removed while sucking Yakult. “Little Yu, you are so young. The director wanted us to ask how you acted so-”</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, a textbook with the fragrant smell of sunflower seeds was sent to him. “Here. Take it. You’re welcome. I have highlighted the important points,” Yu Yaoyao said.</p>
<p>Lu Cheng let out an ‘ah’.</p>
<p>Highlighted the points? What was this? An exam?</p>
<p>He absentmindedly took the book and looked down at the cover: <em>Basic Skills of Actors</em>. His hands fumbled and he nearly dropped the book.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao went back to sucking on her Yakult. “There are two more books about the lens and performance segment research. Today… the day after tomorrow, at the latest, I will be finished reading them. I will give them to you then!”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng once again felt dizzy.</p>
<p>Wei Ming patted him on the shoulder, “Little Lu, haven’t you been on Weibo for a long time?” He clearly hadn’t seen the hot searches. Wei Ming moved Lu Cheng aside and said, “Sister Cai, Little Yu, your lives are quite satisfactory. How did you interpret this kind of tragic role?” The question sounded extremely stupid. He quickly added another sentence. “Avoiding the director’s NG. What other experience do you have other than textbooks?”</p>
<p>That was the whole point.</p>
<p>Cai Fang blushed and put the chicken feet down. She glanced at Yu Yaoyao, “You can ask Little Yu, she has a better camera sense.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao tilted her head, thought about it, and shook her head in confusion, “Nothing special.”</p>
<p>When she shook her head, her script fell to the ground.</p>
