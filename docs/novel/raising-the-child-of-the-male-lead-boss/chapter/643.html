            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 108 – Man in the Footage</strong></p>
<p>The director felt even more embarrassed and did not dare to go near the boss but remained standing on the side.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, why are you here?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, with an expressionless mask in place, glanced at him. His voice cold, he said, “My wife’s reputation is <strong>not</strong> tarnished. I will not spare anyone who comes at her with malicious intent. I’m also asking the crew to take out the cameras from the room.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blinked at him and suddenly sighed in relief. If she had gone through a divorce, how could she have survived this backstage ordeal?!</p>
<p>The others could not help but look at her admiringly while only Meng Xinran shook in the corner like a malicious shadow and then revealed a twisted smile.</p>
<p><strong>Cameras? </strong><em>Yes, I will know when I look at it.</em></p>
<p>She forgot something so critical in her impatience! How could Yu Yaoyao resist a date-rape drug, it’s preposterous!</p>
<p>Maybe this is her last cover-up: for Shen Yichong to take out the footage.</p>
<p>The deputy director quickly accepted Shen Yichong’s suggestion and personally took the couple to the monitoring room. Since Shen Yichong had called the police earlier, the police also arrived at the scene. Meanwhile, Meng Xinran quietly followed at the back, her head down to hide her nervousness at the moment.</p>
<p>After a while, the staff brought up the video footage of Yu Yaoyao inside her room after leaving the party.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked when the video replayed with Yu Yaoyao returning to her room, taking a bath to put on some pajamas, and finally engaging with a video call with her son and husband Shen Yichong. Everyone began looking at each other. It was just a short while before they had stormed her room!</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s eyes flashed a trace of panic, but she consoled herself to continue watching.</p>
<p>Not long after, the voice of a man announcing take-out sounded in the video. The deputy director also sweated. It was indeed take-out, Yu Yaoyao didn’t lie.</p>
<p>The next moment, they placed the video on fast forward to find that Yu Yaoyao opened the door, where a man stood outside with a black cap. The hoodie on his jacket covered most of his face. Most striking of all was that he had nothing. No take-out.</p>
<p>“Look, he didn’t have any delivery with him!”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran exclaimed in both nervousness and excitement, her fingers poking at the screen. Her sweet face covered with the declaration of victory!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stood beside Shen Yichong, holding his arm as she secretly took a piece of biscuit to eat from the control room’s staff. But in the next second, her little hand was swatted by Shen Yichong with a stern face.</p>
<p><em>Hey</em>… Yu Yaoyao took back her hand feeling injustice and looked at him piteously.</p>
<p>Everyone looked to Yu Yaoyao with questioning faces at the critical information displayed on the video but found they didn’t want to intrude on the couple’s interaction. Similarly, the deputy director immediately turned his face away awkwardly and looked straight ahead.</p>
<p><em>Ha ha</em>, <em>Mr. Shen is quite fierce but still looks…very loving.</em> The deputy director secretly thought, when suddenly in the video, the strange man took a step inside the room.</p>
<p>The man looked to his left and right warily. When he found no one else was inside the room but Yu Yaoyao, he then turned around and unconventionally kicked the door shut.</p>
<p><em>‘What takeout? Aren’t you aware you never ordered a meal?’</em> He looked at Yu Yaoyao, licking his lower lip. Under the brim of his hoodie, he looked at Yu Yaoyao with dripping lewdness.</p>
<p><em>‘Beauty, don’t be silly, how can you still want it now?’</em> His eyes trailed down to her pajamas. <em>‘Do you want to make guys crazy? Huh, female stars dress like this too, that’s surprising…’</em></p>
<p>He rubbed his hands excitedly and pushed Yu Yaoyao into a corner.</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes bulged out of their sockets. <em>Isn’t there a problem? What kind of opening remarks are these? They are not what a delivery man is ought to say at all!</em></p>
<p>Their line of sight went back to Yu Yaoyao, suddenly full of doubts while Shen Yichong frowned and stepped forward, blocking all eyes.</p>
<p>The obscene voice of the man soon rang out from the video again. <em>‘Don’t worry, we reached a proper business agreement with the amount paid; I’ll make sure nobody knows of this after I leave the room.’</em></p>
<p>In the video, Yu Yaoyao’s soft voice quickly answered him. <em>‘Money? Is someone paying you?’ </em></p>
<p>The crowd was surprised again. <em>A transaction with money?</em></p>
<p>The corners of Meng Xinran’s mouth lifted, showing a smile of triumph. But in the next moment, that smile became frozen on her face.</p>
<p><em>‘Is this person paying you blind? Did you think such a pig head like you can put your hands on a woman like me?’</em></p>
