            <p><strong>Chapter 322 – Experiencing Life Together (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Little Shen Rui had wanted to make a request from his father the previous day. But after returning to his Mommy’s crew’s hotel, Yu Yaoyao had fed him chicken wings and soup. Then he’d watched the show ‘Wife and I’ with her.</p>
<p>Director Zhao’s show was grounded and funny, but rarely showed excessive intimacy between the husband and wife. In the show, the family had gone shopping and cooked, nothing was explicit. Shen Rui could safely watch it, and he did, quite happily so.</p>
<p>However, by the end of the show, the baby was jealous of his dad. The picture of Mom and Dad in the supermarket together was very beautiful. Mommy was extremely pretty, and Dad had looked very neat. Him… He was only the baby. His body was pixelated, and he was wearing a dog mask to hide his face.</p>
<p>At that time, he’d promised his dad that as long as he could be with Mommy, he would wear the mask, for the safety of his father. But there was no harm in noting the comparison!</p>
<p>Little Bun was watching TV. He was about Shen Yichong’s height. When he saw his pixelated body held in Yu Yaoyao’s arms with the dog mask covering his face, he felt a little sad.</p>
<p>Shen Rui had waited for Mommy and Daddy to go to bed, then taken out his tablet again. He’d watched a little pudding advertisement wherein Mommy was cast. There was a child about his age in it who acted as Mommy’s ‘son’. She had kissed his forehead on the TV…</p>
<p>And so, last night the baby had been a little upset. The more the child watched the advertisement, and looked back at his own pixelated body, the more uncomfortable he’d become.</p>
<p>“Shen Rui, Uncle Ni Yi is talking to your mother, come here,” Shen Yichong called. He’d always been strict with his son’s upbringing.</p>
<p>When an adult was talking, a child should not interrupt. It was out of the question. What’s more, they had discussed this issue many times before. Shen Yichong motioned for Ni Yi to continue and pulled the little baby, whose head and hands were hanging down, into his arms.</p>
<p>Baby Shen Rui pouted and opened his mouth to speak, but he quickly closed it and did not interrupt Uncle Ni. But he restlessly pulled at the ‘Welcome to My House’ plan in Ni Yi’s hands, his tender, white little fingers gripping the edge of the paper tightly. With his head drooping, he stuffed his small face into Shen Yichong’s chest.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, an old father who was always stoic and calm, was shocked when his son’s small face touched him. His son looked pitiful and depressed. It was obvious Shen Rui wanted to cry but because there were outsiders, he pretended to be strong.  Shen Yichong’s brain was cold and sensible when it came to outsiders and so he was unable to react quickly.</p>
<p>“Shen Rui…” Shen Yichong said hoarsely and patted his son’s small back stiffly.</p>
<p>His son did not require too much reassurance. He’d lacked paternal affection when he was young, and so he was more attached to Yu Yaoyao now. But as a husband and father, he could not ask his wife to stay at home and not go to work. As a father, he suddenly found himself in a dilemma, and he felt sorry for the child. Not to mention Yu Yaoyao, who couldn’t resist her baby.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, little one?” Yu Yaoyao, who was sitting on the sofa, noticed immediately that her baby didn’t look okay. “My dear, what’s the matter? Are you upset?” Yu Yaoyao’s gentle questioning was too much for the child.</p>
<p>Baby Shen Rui’s small mouth folded, and his clear eyes filled with tears. His long lashes fluttered, and fat tears rolled down his round, pink face. “Mom… Mommy,” he sobbed, “I want to be with Mommy.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui didn’t want to be in his father’s arms when he started crying. He stretched his tiny hands out towards Yu Yaoyao. Shen Rui rarely cried like this. Shen Yichong hadn’t said much, but it had been enough to make the baby’s mood collapse completely.</p>
<p>Distressed, Yu Yaoyao immediately took her child into her arms and hugged him tightly, “Don’t cry, don’t cry, Mommy is here… Did Dad scare you just now? Dad didn’t scold you, he was just talking to you,” she cooed. She thought for a while before she found the crux of the problem, “Why are you so sad? Is it because you want to go to work with Mommy?”</p>
<p>She’d hit the nail on the head. Shen Rui began to cry even harder. The little droplet of sadness in his heart suddenly overflowed like a big rushing river.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry, little one. If you have any words, express them and Mommy will work with you to find a solution,” Yu Yaoyao pulled out a baby wipe and dried her son’s tears. “Didn’t you tell Mommy two days ago that if you have a problem and meet a bad person, you shouldn’t hide and cry by yourself?”</p>
<p>But little Shen Rui narrowed his mouth, sniffed, and dropped his head in silence. In his fair right hand, he was grasping the copy of the announcement from the TV station.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao lowered her face and touched his forehead with the tip of her nose, “Is this Uncle Zhao Yu’s TV show? Darling, do you want Mommy to shoot this? Do you want to do this show with Mommy?”</p>
<p>The little baby suddenly bit his pink lips, pinched Yu Yaoyao’s sleeve with his left hand, and cautiously nodded his small chin. “Uh-huh,” he uttered softly.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stroked his little head lovingly, “Why did Mommy think it was a big deal? You want to be on TV with Mommy, isn’t that easy to say?”</p>
<p>She had watched many TV shows and movies that were child themed. There were even children in many reality shows. She sneered at families who used children as cash cows and had them desperately film movies that prevented them from going to school. But if it was just a small part that didn’t affect life and study… She thought it would be okay.</p>
<p>As soon as she’d spoken, little Shen Rui lifted his big damp eyes, his soft body shivered in her arms as though he couldn’t believe it. But in the next second, he turned his aggravated gaze on Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>His father clearly disagreed.</p>
<p>Shen Rui held back his words, but his thoughts were written all over his little face. The little guy held back his words and said nothing.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao moved her gaze over to the clearly big-headed man beside her. She felt her clothes pull tight. When she looked down, they were held in her baby’s hands. She smiled and patted his hand.</p>
<p>“Husband, I know you want to protect your child,” she said, “and you think that Little Ruirui’s exposure will endanger him. But, with your wealth today, even if Little Ruirui did not appear on TV, could you guarantee that no criminals would come after him? And me, with my current exposure, eventually it will be known that I have money, and you have money… the wealth of the family is enough to make people take risks,” as Yu Yaoyao spoke, she held the baby Shen Rui and opened the announcement he was tightly holding.</p>
