            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 177 – Yaoyao’s Biggest Fans (1)</strong></p>
<p>When Qiu Dajian came out of the black room after a series of challenges, he caused a wave of warm screams. All his fans, both teenage girls and mothers, were agitated, supportive, and continuously chanted his name.</p>
<p>“Elder brother, you are the best and the most handsome!”</p>
<p>“Elder brother, you will for sure bag first place!”</p>
<p>The originally well-organized support slogan for Qiu Dajian was very loud as of the moment. However, there were some objections among the crowd upon hearing what his fans said.</p>
<p>For example, Shen Rui, the little bun, who was sitting on his father’s lap, with his cheeks puffing and small eyebrows frowning, looked at the excited girl who was yelling in the seat next to him. That girl was obviously Qiu Dajian’s ultimate fan.</p>
<p>With a downturned mouth and clenched fists, the little bun couldn’t hold back his annoyance.</p>
<p>“Pretty sister, my Mommy will take home the first place! My mom is the best ~”</p>
<p>The Qiu Dajian fan girl sitting next to him was obviously stunned at what she heard. She slowly turned her head and saw the little bun looking at her in a huff, but still cute. She couldn’t believe a cute creature like him spoke to her!</p>
<p>The little bun watched the entire show all the way, with very few interactions with his father.</p>
<p>She’d overheard a few words from him the entire time and thought how cute he was. But the little bun was wearing a mask and a hat, making it difficult for her to see his entire face. However, she was able to catch a glimpse of the fluffy pink cheeks of the little bun! Now, she didn’t expect the cute baby sitting right next to her would speak, expressing his support to his mother and assuring her that his Mommy will win first place.</p>
<p><em>Whoa, whoa, whoa! I’m a big fan of Elder brother Qiu Dajian, I can’t be shaken by this cute baby!</em></p>
<p>But she thought that little bun was too cute, as well as Qiu Dajian… but then, she reasoned out that her elder brother was not as cute as a teddy bear.</p>
<p>The fangirl of Qiu Dajian was the one leading the fandom in hooting and screaming for support while holding the banner. However, as she glanced at the little bun, she saw a Shen Rui full of grievance; her voice turned lower and lower until she finally became very embarrassed to speak.</p>
<p>Well, it’s not that she didn’t have the power to fight, it’s just that the enemy was too strong. Just that look was too powerful!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s performance today had really touched her and the female fan, who looked at the Qiu Dajian on the stage, smiled insincerely and sighed. In addition, the same also occurred in other parts in the auditorium, and even in the live broadcast room. Many fans of different fandoms, as long as they were of a reasonable mindset, could see that Yu Yaoyao had performed wonderfully, displaying the most genuine and high-class acting.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian was still quite popular and slightly better with his acting skills.</p>
<p>But when the third placer was announced for the current ranking, Chen Ruixi, known as the Little Jade Girl, let our a few cries of happiness on the stage.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao came out of the black room and was announced that she had ranked 12th in the total voting results, a wild cry was heard among the crowd. Yu Yaoyao had everything, every bit of her acting was natural… even her character was genuine and not fake. All fandoms holding different slogans united, everyone was in favor of Yu Yaoyao at this point in time.</p>
<p>“Goddess Yu Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>“YYY is beautiful!”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Y is the most beautiful!”</p>
<p>“Oh, suck… her beauty is not worthy of this type of competition!”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Yu has beaten everyone in this competition!”</p>
<p>Even if most of them were not fans of Yu Yaoyao, they still gave her a round of respectful applause. For her performances throughout the competition deserved respect!</p>
<p>The comment section in the live broadcast room was flooded with a bunch of flowers and roars, wishing that they did not watch the show which made them fall head over heels for her.</p>
<p>And Yu Yaoyao did not disappoint anyone, especially her fans who were defending her from the very beginning. She stood there, even at the end, like a vivid oil painting with extremely heavy colors, bearing the most graceful and charming look. Even the casual dress she was wearing appeared like a limited-edition clothing collection of a well-known clothing-line.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Shen Rui, little bun, couldn’t help but feel sad.</p>
<p>The little bun who was looking at his Mommy on the stage struggled to shout. ‘Mommy cheer! ‘,’ Mommy is the best ‘.</p>
<p>His little buttocks couldn’t stay still, wanting to stand up and applaud for his Mommy! While Shen Yichong’s mouth turned upside down, still trying to focus his gaze on Yu Yaoyao who was standing on the stage, but his eyes were kept on being covered by the audience standing in front of him. Soon, knowing what his son had wanted to do, he couldn’t help but look warmly at him.</p>
<p>He held the little bun’s butt, turned back and said sorry to the audience behind him, and lifted his son up.</p>
<p>“Aw! Mommy ~ Baby Rui is here!”</p>
<p>Shen Rui desperately looked at the stage, waving his small hands holding the colorful glow in the dark sticks that formed virtual shadows. Yu Yaoyao heard his voice from among the screaming crowd and her beautiful eyes suddenly turned brighter than the stars, laughing charmingly.</p>
<p>She immediately waved to that part of the stage and formed a big heart with her hands, making him chuckle happily.</p>
<p>He was so happy that his Mommy saw him amidst the crowd!</p>
<p>Seeing Baby Rui cheer for his mother, Shen Yichong smiled and put his son down, letting him sit on his lap.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Daddy, ~”</p>
<p>The little bun looked up to his father and gave Shen Yichong a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pulled out a smile on his face and said, “You’re welcome, son.”</p>
