            <p><strong>Chapter 367</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao finished her filming for the day in a quick and timely manner.</p>
<p>When she returned to her longue, she found Little Bun sitting on the sofa, holding his tablet tightly and looking seriously down at it. He was sitting very far away from Shen Yichong, as far away as he could get in fact.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had his head lowered as he read over a document with an expressionless face.</p>
<p>It seemed like father and son were in the middle of some type of conflict. They were sitting on opposite sides of the sofa, refusing to speak to each other.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed when she saw the scene.</p>
<p>Although Little Bun was still very young, and he usually preferred to spend more time with her, his characteristics were very much like Shen Yichong’s. When he was angry, his small face became serious, just like a miniature version of Shen Yichong. Fortunately, the cold expressions on their faces melted away when they saw her.</p>
<p>“Mommy!” Little Bun exclaimed when he looked up. His eyes lit up at the sight of her, and he opened his arms for a hug.  “You’re back!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong also raised his handsome face, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth. He reached out to hug her around the waist.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao paused. She looked between the two of them, at their eager, outstretched hands; the sight brought on an immediate headache.</p>
<p>Little Bun looked at her expectantly, and Shen Yichong was looking at her affectionately.</p>
<p>Then, father and son glanced at each other, and silently looked away, still unwilling to look at each other.</p>
<p>Was this some type of cold war they were locked in?</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao touched her nose as she considered her options. Finally, she stretched out one hand to Little Bun, who couldn’t wait to rush into her arms, and took Shen Yichong’s hand with the other. “Aren’t you two tired of waiting? I’m done with work. We can go home now.”</p>
<p>“Mummy, have some juice!” Little Bun held her hand, kicked his short legs, and slid his chubby body slid off the sofa. He reached forward and picked up the strawberry juice they had brought from home.</p>
<p>“Drink warm water instead. Juice lacks fiber and will make you pick up weight.” Shen Yichong turned around and picked up the thermos next to him. He poured her a cup of hot tea and offered it to her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled awkwardly between the two cups.</p>
<p>Little Bun pouted again and looked at his father. At the same time, Shen Yichong looked at him. Their gazes locked.</p>
<p>Little Bun ended up lowering his hands. For the sake of his mommy’s health, he gave up and stepped back with his head lowered. “Mommy, drink the warm water.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was touched, but at the same time, she didn’t know whether she should laugh or cry at the secret rivalry between her husband and son.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had just had a confrontation on set with Chen Qiao, and now he was fighting with his son?</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao took the tea and took a sip. Fearing that they’d start fighting again, she quickly put her coat on and said, “Let’s go home.”</p>
<p>Little Bun and Shen Yichong both stood up immediately, each of them sticking close to their respective sides of Yu Yaoyao’s body. Little Bun wanted to hold her hand, and Shen Yichong wanted to drape his arm over her shoulders.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was speechless.</p>
<p>When they returned home, she sent Shen Yichong to the gym, telling him to go and exercise. She took Little Bun to the children’s room.</p>
<p>Little Bun was acting as if nothing had happened, and wanted to show her the block castle he’d built, but Yu Yaoyao patted the small bed and sat down. “Baby, come and chat with Mommy.”</p>
<p>Little Bun hesitated for a moment before he walked over. “Mommy, I don’t want to talk about Dad.” The man had spanked him yesterday. In front of a girl; his mommy. While the actual smack didn’t hurt, his father had damaged his dignity in front of a girl. He didn’t want to talk about his dad, and he wouldn’t want to talk about him for the next few days either.</p>
<p>Little Bun shared his thoughts with his mother. He even pursed his lips after speaking, expressing his stubborn resolve.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao couldn’t help but smile. She kind of understood the little guy’s way of thinking. It reminded her of the olden days. She’d ignored the breeder for three days when he’d forgotten to give her one meal. She refused to reconcile with him so quickly after that!</p>
<p>“Okay, Mommy understands.” Yu Yaoyao hugged her son and patted him on his soft back. “Baby, you have grown up so much. Mommy respects your opinion. Your father spanked you, and you’re feeling a little emotional about it. It’s quite normal to not want to talk about him. But don’t keep this up for too long and make him feel terrible. He’s your father, after all. Can you do that for me?”</p>
<p>Back then, she’d let her anger take over, and the end result of that was that she was starved even more.</p>
<p>Whether it be man or snake, one had to be smart. Lower your head when you have no other choice. When the other party lets their guard down, you can take everything back.</p>
<p>As soon as Little Bun heard what his mommy said, his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Most of the loneliness and shame that had been on his serious face before was now gone. He hadn’t expected his mommy to be so understanding. It seemed like she knew exactly how he felt. His mommy had really changed. Now, she not only loved and protected him, but she was also super cute, gentle, and nice.</p>
<p>“Mommy,” Little Bun said as he stretched out his hand and grasped her firmly. He hugged her tightly, refusing to let her go. “I understand. I won’t talk back to Dad again. But… I still feel a little uncomfortable…”</p>
