            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 189 – Matters of the Heart (1)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was quickly drawn to the crew. She did not know that she had already received a free meal on the set. As long as the director was happy and satisfied with her acting, he would always vote for her, ready to feed her every time.</p>
<p>At this moment, she was listening to the director’s monologue.</p>
<p>“Today, you will be the first to film. Right… in the beginning, Yu Ji travels with her maid and sees the emperor. As soon as she sees him, Yu Ji is attracted to him. Appropriate emotions and expressions should be portrayed in this scene.”</p>
<p>Last night, Zhou Lin had directly gone to the crew for initial preparations. And today, without a word, he’d brought Yu Yaoyao for a briefing. But for a moment, Yu Yaoyao was absent-minded as she had been thinking about her husband’s affairs. Nevertheless, she had read the script several times, so when she was called to play her part, she didn’t panic.</p>
<p>Yu Haiquan, an artist who had been acting since he was a child, played the supporting role of the emperor whose kingdom was subjugated. The young actor was a shy, handsome boy, blushing at the sight of Yu Yaoyao. However, on camera, he’d transform into an extremely different person playing his part to the T. His superb acting skills and instantly wowed the production team, he was anticipated to join the league of the new generation film emperors.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s start!” The director called out.</p>
<p>As soon as she heard the clapperboard, Yu Yaoyao immediately immersed herself into the scene, looking down at the comb in the stall, playing with them. However, hearing a noise behind her, she turned her head and looked bewildered. Soon, her misty eyes looked far away to the middle of the road… as if drawn by a stream of light that sucked people in.</p>
<p>But–</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>Zhou Lin looked at the camera with a slightly wrinkled brow. Pausing the filming, he waved to Yu Yaoyao, standing in front of the reflector.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, your eyes… they lack a girl’s temptation. There was no feeling at all. Just now, everything was good, the background, the atmosphere, and your beauty were in full bloom. But although you hook people with it, it doesn’t express the kind of love a girl expresses or the kind of feeling a person feels when she or he is attracted to someone…” Zhou Lin thoroughly explained to Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Do you understand what I said?” Zhou Lin subconsciously asked after patiently finishing his explanation.</p>
<p>In response, Yu Yaoyao just shook her head blankly. She could feel her heart beating all the time. But she didn’t quite understand what she should feel when in play. Soon, she turned her head to see the emperor and thought- ‘she had to feel attracted to him’.</p>
<p>Right at the moment, Zhou Lin froze. He took a step back and reconsidered what he had just said. Yu Yaoyao was already married and had a child. It was only natural that her emotions right now were indeed unlike those girls who were still in the first stage of falling in love. Moreover, she wasn’t trained.</p>
<p>He frowned trying to think of something else.</p>
<p>“It’s like you and President Shen. When you met each other for the first time, you may have felt some enchantment. That feeling of seeing him among the crowd as if everyone else in the world has disappeared. You both like each other, and you want to show him your true self, your love… your entire being.” Zhou Lin stopped halfway as he saw the female lead arrive.</p>
<p>But soon, he resumed. “Take your time and go over it, I will talk to them about the drama arrangement after that.”</p>
<p>After all, Yu Yaoyao was just a supporting character. Even though Zhou Lin valued her, he’s the director and had to pay attention to other characters, especially the male and female leads.</p>
<p>“The first time we met?” Yu Yaoyao stood there and murmured to herself. She had transmigrated into the book and seen Shen Yichong for the first time…</p>
<p>“Sister, what’s wrong?” Ni Yi came over hurriedly and offered her a bottled-water.</p>
<p>“Ni Yi, do you have any idea how the heart feels?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi froze for a moment. “Me? I… I did know when I was a teenager.” He blushed as he spoke.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao saw him touching his chest and turned to his face only to see him blushing badly.</p>
<p><em>Blushing, shy…? Why do people blush whenever they talk about feelings? </em>She was confused.</p>
<p>However, Ni Yi seemed to have opened up some memories. “I met my first love when on a desk. At that time, she was the only one who didn’t bother me with my fatness or poor grades. She was also willing to sit with me, and I fell in love with her.”</p>
<p>“Sitting next to her every day, my heart always beat fast. I couldn’t hear the teacher’s lesson as I always looked at her and thought that she was cute,” he said, inadvertently helping her by showing her emotions of falling in love with someone.</p>
