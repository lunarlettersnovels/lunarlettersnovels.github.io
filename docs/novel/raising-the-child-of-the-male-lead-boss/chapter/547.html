            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 213 – Untimely Visitor (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Come on in, I’ll go get my notebook,” she told her, and Yu Xinjie blinked. Notebook? Did she hear it wrong?</p>
<p>But before she could ask what it was, Yu Yaoyao had already disappeared inside the house, and she followed suit. As soon as she arrived inside, she saw a couple of cameras surrounding the open diner, with Shen Yichong and Shen Rui by the dining table.</p>
<p>Her eyes lit up at the sight of them!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was a smart guy, but in front of the child, he would usually hold back for the child’s protection. And she knew her sister, Yu Yaoyao, was a stupid person, but she longed for others’ recognition and care all her life.</p>
<p>Every time she came to visit with the whole family present, she just needed to agitate her a bit, which would make Yu Yaoyao act out in front of Shen Yichong, and that would just make Shen Yichong hate her more.</p>
<p>A situation such that her sister could not get any response, she repelled Shen Yichong even more and thought Chen Qiao was the real love of her life.</p>
<p>Although Yu Xinjie didn’t know what happened to Yu Yaoyao lately, she became more resistant, even smarter, she believed that what was inside a person would not change.</p>
<p>Stupidity, cowardness – nothing would change.</p>
<p>Rebellion, stubborn and disobedience were all temporary, even if she broke her brain, these unusual behaviors were all temporary!</p>
<p>Once she had something on her sister, she could make her listen to her again!</p>
<p>“Sis, what are you busy with?”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie was very confident and looked upstairs.</p>
<p>Then she smiled and looked at Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Yichong, long time no see, my sister keeps giving you trouble. Recently she changed a lot, probably because her emotion accumulated to the extreme and she can’t suppress it anymore.”</p>
<p>“She told me before, that if you like someone, you need to become a better person for him, too bad she could only stay at home and didn’t have a chance to do that.”</p>
<p>“Now she finally has the chance, she must work hard, doesn’t she?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao liked Chen Qiao and didn’t love Shen Yichong at all.</p>
<p>She could deceive everyone in the world, but not him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong knew it too well, from all her sister’s rebellion and resistance in the past five years.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie said, with a harmless smile on her face.</p>
<p>If Yu Yaoyao was trying to become a better person, certainly it was not for him, and he knew it more than anyone else.</p>
<p>Even if he didn’t love her, no man could stand being cheated on.</p>
<p>“Yichong, I heard your company is having a crisis, is my sister’s mood okay?”</p>
<p>She must have been crying and yelling at home.</p>
<p><em>Heh.</em></p>
<p>Yu Xinjie said and looked at Shen Yichong inquisitively.</p>
<p>Even in front of the camera, she was not timid, but talking and smiling naturally.</p>
<p>She already made a decision, that she would make Yu Yaoyao do something stupid in front of more people so that Shen Yichong could make up his mind to divorce her.</p>
<p>And whether Shen Yichong was doomed or not, she might as well test it.</p>
<p>If he still held some properties, she would instigate Yu Yaoyao to strive for more alimony, which at the end would all be hers!</p>
<p>“She is fine.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong showed no trace of emotion on his face, just wiped his son’s mouth, and cut the vegetable into small pieces for him.</p>
<p>“She is not giving me any trouble.”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie frowned, but suddenly understood when she saw the cameras on the side.</p>
<p>Surely, men needed their dignity.</p>
<p>However, Shen Yichong’s next sentence killed her smile.</p>
<p>“On the contrary, coming to visit late at night is making me feel a little troublesome.”</p>
<p>“Our kid needs to sleep early, there is no one to treat you, and the driver is not here. There are no street lights nearby, nobody would know if someone’s missing….”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie’s face got stiff, “Yichong, why do you say such terrifying things? Do you dislike me that much? I’m my sister’s only sibling, after all, I just came home, and heard about what happened to you, so I came to visit because I worried about my sister.”</p>
<p>“You two are sisters, but don’t have the same mother.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t even look at her.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie choked her breath, “But I lived with my sister for more than ten years, we are closer than twins.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong finally raised his eyes, with obvious coldness in his look.</p>
<p>Before he said anything, Shen Rui sitting in the children’s chair looked curiously at his auntie Yu Xinjie.</p>
<p>“Daddy, what do you mean not the same mommy? So do Auntie and Mommy have the same daddy?”</p>
<p>He asked right after he swallowed the steak in his mouth.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong adjusted his napkins and nodded, “Yes, they have the same dad, but not the same mom.”</p>
<p>The kid suddenly widened his eyes and put his fork down.</p>
<p>“Daddy, Mommy’s daddy married two mommies?” He exclaimed, with shock on his face.</p>
<p>“So, Mommy’s mommy, and Auntie’s mommy, how do I call them? Big grandma, small grandma?”</p>
