            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 221 – A Cunning Husband (2)</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong kissed his wife until she couldn’t breathe, her face flushed pink, lips red and swollen.</p>
<p><em>How could this be a show? Even an Oscar winning actor couldn’t pull off a role this well.</em></p>
<p>Unconsciously, Zhao Yu became this couple’s fan and just then, felt like he had settled a score on their behalf.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong belatedly realized that there were still cameras shooting them, so he straightened Yu Yaoyao’s clothes to cover her skin and patted her butt.</p>
<p>“Director Zhao is still here.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu, heard his name and felt awkward. He cleared his throat and asked something he was curious about.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, Qiu Dajian is in the second place of the competition, <em>In the Limelight</em>. Did you perhaps, foresee this and negotiate with him?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, in the first round, I saw the spark in him. He has great potential. “</p>
<p>Zhao Yu gasped, “What about Screenwriter Liu? I heard she is in her husband’s company.”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Liu is a writer who lends soul to her scripts. As a matter of fact, I’ve admired her talent for four years and have invited her to my company. She had always been busy focusing on her husband’s career, but earlier this year, she stated on Weibo that she would polish her scripts, and make her scripting career independent from her husband’s company.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nonchalantly continued, “So, this year, I approached her again, and she finally agreed.”</p>
<p><em>What ?!? </em><em><strong>How come he didn’t release the news until now !?</strong></em></p>
<p>Zhao Yu’s mouth hung open in shock.</p>
<p>He was now uncertain what to make of Shen Yichong, whom he had originally,  perceived as merely a businessman, who happened to be interested in the entertainment industry, and gained his position because of his foresight and wealth.</p>
<p>But now, he needed to reassess.</p>
<p><em>Had Shen Yichong prepared all this because he long expected this crisis of stock price decline, or did he already know that Chen Jiao would leave Guangxin? Were all these announcements premeditated?</em></p>
<p>This man did not only possess the foresight, but also the resolution that had undoubtedly made him who he was.</p>
<p>“And Director Zhou……”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu had invited Zhou Qiu in person, to be one of the judges on <em>In the Limelight</em>, for Zhou Qiu had always been popular in the business, having won the award for the best director.</p>
<p>However, a lesser known reason for inviting him was that he had established his own company and art brand, and didn’t align or associate with any entertainment company.</p>
<p>Therefore, he could be trusted to be objective and fair, by not favoring any actor in the competition.</p>
<p><em>But this……this was also pre-arranged?!</em></p>
<p>“Director Zhou was an old friend of my father’s, and wanted to work with me since last year, but I felt that Guangxin wasn’t big enough in the show business yet, so I turned him down.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squeezed Yu Yaoyao’s hands as he spoke.</p>
<p>“But Director Zhou gave me and Guangxin many precious suggestions in the film market.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu stared in speechless amazement.</p>
<p><em>Even Zhou Qiu was Shen Yichong’s man? So he was the hidden external help to Guangxin!</em></p>
<p>“No wonder, Zhou Qiu used a new actor from your company in his last movie.” Realization slowly dawned on Zhao Yu.</p>
<p>Just then, Yu Yaoyao started to grumble, “What the heck, so you had already invited them……I made all those efforts for nothing.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong chuckled, “Zhao Xiaomeng and Director Zhao were not on my list. They’re too hard to get.”</p>
<p>This made Yu Yaoyao glow with pride. She felt pleased that she had done something worthwhile.</p>
<p>“There’s no problem with Zhao Xiaomeng, she promised me already!”</p>
<p>“As for Director Zhao……”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was once again, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>She was really bold, trying to poach him right in front of the whole crew.</p>
<p>Although he felt sorely tempted, he waved his hands in refusal, “My contract is not terminated yet.”</p>
<p>“When does it expire? You can come then.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>At a loss for words, he didn’t want to say anything more.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Shen Yichong rescued him as he took Yu Yaoyao back to the house, saying, “It’s OK. You already brought Director Zhao’s niece into Guangxin; he is now one of us too.”</p>
<p>Both Yu Yaoyao and Zhao Yu stared at him in amazement.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>That night, Yu Yaoyao was explained the insider-intricacies by her husband on their giant bed.</p>
<p>“<em>In the Limelight</em> was a show with very high standards, many newcomers couldn’t get in. As an unaffiliated trainee, Zhao Xiaomeng had very limited experience, yet she managed to get into the show; this indicates that she is not as simple as you thought.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so she was like me, she has connections,” stated Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had put his son to bed, and had found his wife sitting up when he returned to their bedroom, so he concluded  the topic with one sentence.</p>
<p>“Right, she is the director’s relative, but many people don’t know about this. Zhao Xiaomeng made it to the final on her own; it was not easy for her.”</p>
<p>“But you didn’t fancy her…did you?” Yu Yaoyao turned to look at him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squinted at the sight of her.</p>
<p>She lay on the bed, her pretty white breasts almost fell out from her nightdress. She always had possessed the ability to make a modest and dignified dress seem like sexy, seductive lingerie.</p>
<p>The hem of her nightdress was already rolled up to her pretty skinny waist to expose not just her calves, even her waist. Her small white feet drove him wild.</p>
<p>“That day……you were the only one in my eyes.” He said, his voice hoarse.</p>
<p>He held her feet. Every single one of her toes was as white and tender as silky tofu, and her toenails were painted a delicate shade of pink.</p>
<p>“On the stage, I could see no one else but you.”</p>
<p>She sparkled on the stage; no other woman could compare to her.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng was pure and real, but she was still incomparable.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt a rumbling growl erupt in his chest as he slid his hands under her dress along her slender legs.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao turned and lost herself in  his sparkling eyes, burning with desire.</p>
