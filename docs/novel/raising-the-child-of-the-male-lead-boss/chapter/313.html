            <p><strong>Chapter 450</strong></p>
<p>Having his attention diverted, Little Bun also nodded his head, “It has to be washed, so we won’t cause trouble to others. Then, Uncle Gangster, we can write the self-reflection essay after washing this!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao “!” Just how many self-reflection essays did this child write at home? Was he addicted to it?</p>
<p>The two soon began to work together to remove the sofa covers. Then, they got together to discuss whether to put the covers directly in the washing machine or wash it directly. They squatted and looked at the thickness and size of the fabric. After looking at each other, they decided to just put it into the washing machine. And since it was raining, Little Bun suggested drying it directly as well.</p>
<p>“In this way, when the host aunty and uncle come back tomorrow, they’ll get to see a brand new sofa.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao also agreed. After setting the drying mode, he started to have to discuss with Little Bun.</p>
<p>“Some mistakes can be solved without writing a self-reflection essay,” Chen Jiao began. “The act of repentance is more important than verbal reflection.”</p>
<p>Two hours later, Chen Jiao took Little Bun, who was finally willing to give up writing a self-reflection essay, and went to the laundry room to get the sofa cover, only to find that the originally flat and beautiful cloth cover had become wrinkled and faded! Not only did it not return to its original state, it was completely destroyed!</p>
<p>Little Bun was so shocked that he couldn’t close his mouth. Chen Jiao’s face was also twisted.</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian, who was passing by, took a closer look and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, “Brother Qiao, Xiao Rui, this is cloth that can’t be dried with a dryer.”</p>
<p>When Chen Jiao turned around stiffly, he saw Shen Yichong’s mocking expression.</p>
<p>As his mind was not working properly, he blurted out, “I will take Xiao Rui to buy a new set and replace it for the host.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mocking expression was even more obvious now. “The car key is on the coffee table outside.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was about to take Shen Rui out as soon as he heard that. But when he was about to step out, he found that he had no money in his pocket as they were taken away by the production crew before he joined the program. Their family funds they had for the past two days were all with Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Little Bun also shrugged helplessly, “Forget it, Uncle Gangster.. Let’s just apologize to daddy. He’ll forgive us.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao gritted his teeth, “It’s okay. Uncle can also make money. The problem will always be solved.”</p>
<p>At this moment, he didn’t even notice what was wrong in Little Bun’s sentences. Originally, this was only a series of consequences caused by Little Bun’s mistakes. From beginning to end, it had nothing to do with Chen Jiao. Chen Jiao didn’t realize that he should not be included in Little Bun’s ‘we’.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao, who was stubborn and refused to admit defeat, would rather die than to apologize. As a result, he went to perform on the street. When he finally earned  five hundred Yuan, they were confiscated by Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“The economy in a mountainous area is bad. The winner of a best actor award and a kid who doesn’t lack pocket money at home, are asking help from the less fortunate. How shameful.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s heart, which was still feeling motivated when he came back, turned cold after hearing Shen Yichong’s words.</p>
<p>“Return all the money,” Shen Yichong coldly said.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s face froze. He really sympathized with Little Bun when he took him out again.</p>
<p>“Your father really… Little Rui…”</p>
<p>Originally, he always thought that he was miserable when he was a child, and that God was unfair. He was always wondering why some people get to be rich and enjoy their lives since childhood, but he couldn’t. But he didn’t expect Little Bun, who was born into a rich family and destined to have nothing to worry about, would be so unkindly disciplined by the cold-faced Mr. Shen every day.</p>
<p>He could no longer endure Shen Yichong’s bad temper after several years. Sure, Shen Yichong might be right at times, but his cold face was so annoying! Little Bun was destined to endure his dad’s bad temper for a lifetime!</p>
<p>“Uncle Gangster, I do in fact think what my daddy said makes sense. We shall listen to him!” Little Bun secretly pulled Chen Jiao and brainwashed him. “Since we’ve already tried uncle’s method, and it didn’t work. How about we try mine?”</p>
<p>Before Chen Jiao could react, he was directly dragged back to Shen Yichong by the Little Bun.</p>
<p>“Daddy, I’m sorry, Uncle Gangster and I disappointed you. We have already paid the money back to the villagers. Can you please help us with the money for the broken sofa? Daddy, we were wrong!”</p>
<p>After Little Bun finished speaking, he lowered his head and pulled Chen Jiao’s trousers vigorously. He looked at Chen Jiao with pure, dark eyes that were full of expectation.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao gritted his teeth, but he couldn’t resist Little Bun’s plea in the end. Children were always afraid of their father. If he kept fighting against his father, he might feel sad and scared deep down in his heart. Chen Jiao finally lowered his stubborn head.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, I’m sorry, we were wrong.” After finishing speaking, he seemed to be relieved, and his heart unexpectedly relaxed. All the pain he felt had disappeared!</p>
<p>And in just a second, the corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth twisted up. “Okay, I’ll forgive you. I’ve saved dinner for you.”</p>
<p>While eating the warm meal, Chen Jiao also had mixed feelings. It didn’t seem to be so difficult to admit one’s faults.</p>
<p>Before leaving the next day, Shen Yichong personally sent Chen Jiao away at the door. “Ah Jiao, you are right. Sometimes, the method of education is also very important,” he said. “But I’m not your father after all, you need to depend on yourself in the future.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was stunned. What was he talking about?!</p>
<p>Little Bun also waved goodbye to him at the door, “Uncle Gangster, best of luck! Next year, daddy and I are watching you to win the award!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao “…”</p>
<p>Something felt wrong! But what could it be?!</p>
