            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 61 – A Mukbang Session</strong></p>
<p>She’s never full!</p>
<p>“Only on weekends can I eat throughout the week, and the meal barely fills my stomach. Every night, I wake up from my sleep, hungry and delirious. But when I look up, I can only see the cold floor and an endless wall…the outside world is clearly separated from where I live with just this one wall. But it’s still so, so far away. No matter how far I climb, I still can’t climb out. No matter how much I crawled in desperation—crawling with my body full of injuries, I still can’t get out…”</p>
<p>Every time she tried to escape from the zoo at night, she always failed!</p>
<p>And when she tried to escape one last time, she was tragically killed by lightning!</p>
<p>As she said this, she tilted her beautiful face downwards with a small smile bearing the trace of pain and unbridled fear from the depths of her soul.</p>
<p>Her whole frame suddenly shook, and she hugged her shoulders in effort to lessen it. “My whole body is always empty with hunger…my stomach hurts every waking moment…”</p>
<p>She sniffed and her eyes filled with hunger for food. “I always want to have a hot meal in my dreams. Even just a little snack would do just fine.”</p>
<p>She had an embarrassed, little smile on her face, her cheeks slowly turning red. Facing the screen, she bit her bottom lip as her hands unconsciously made their way to her mouth where she tried to cover a big gulp.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, the snacks in this room…can I eat it?”</p>
<p>Her voice was eager and pleading, although she tried hard to restrain her gluttonous desire, there was an obvious joy at the mention of these snacks!</p>
<p><em>I want to eat! I want to gobble all of that snack! I want to taste it now!</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s begging eyes transmitted through the live broadcast, made the keyboard warriors in the channel look on, shocked silly.</p>
<p>538 people were currently viewing her live broadcast; her comment section was still again. They were not awakened from their second daze until they heard her mumble this imploring and unexpected question.</p>
<p>Only then did they find out that there were three packs of snacks next to the bed, easily seen at the screen of the live broadcast of her room.</p>
<p><strong><em>[Wait a minute, isn’t that LAY’S Classic Potato Chips? The cucumber-flavored </em><em>one? I’ve tasted it before too!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[Let this gourmet tell you what the flavors are: original, cucumber and tomato.]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[Goodness, you’re asking to have a mouthful of these potato chips? Go on, you poor thing!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[A scam! This is just paid advertisement, isn’t it? I’m not buying it; do I look like a slag? Can companies stop talking nonsense in Weibo? Even until here, they want to cheat me out of my money? Do you think I’m mentally handicapped?]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[This is intense acting; I can only bow down! Just now, I almost searched for the filming location of the program and wanted to rescue her from that cement wall!]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>[Previous commenter, you’re not alone!]</em></strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao saw the comments and immediately laughed giddily, her front teeth displayed like that of a hamster! She felt also thrilled looking at the screen and bowed her head respectfully, “Then I’ll go ahead and eat. Thank you, thank you everyone!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi confiscated the snacks she bought a few days ago, she wasn’t even able to eat everything!</p>
<p>After eating barely half a pack of barbecued potato chips, he caught her red-handed and banned her! But as soon as she entered the room today, she saw these three, big packs of potato chips at first sight.</p>
<p>She took a potato chip from red pack, “Ohhhh…it’s crispy…there’s a lingering flavor after you taste it. And when you try to bite it–what’s this exotic flavor? It’s sour with just the right hint of sweetness, and an underlying saltiness from the potato too. It’s really crispy…oh, it’s tomato-flavored!”</p>
<p>She moved on to the green-colored variant next. “Hmmm, the cucumber-flavored potato chip tastes so…fresh. It’s like a cool breeze blowing at the tip of my tongue. It’s as if my whole soul seems to have risen to the sky to feel the wind—this is probably how a spring wind would taste!”</p>
<p>“I’m going to eat another piece of the original flavored potato chips. I will only eat one…”</p>
<p>With that, she chewed a mouthful of potato chips in front of the camera as if they were treasure. Just as how she ate the steak from last time, she enjoyed eating the snacks very much and was reluctant to stop.</p>
<p>With every bite, her lips almost shivered at the delicious taste, tears gradually brimming in both her eyes…</p>
<p>The number of people watching her live broadcast soon rose in a flash, jumping instantly from 500 to 1000!</p>
