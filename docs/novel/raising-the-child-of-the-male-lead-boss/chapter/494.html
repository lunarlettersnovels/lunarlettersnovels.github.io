            <p><strong>Chapter 269 – I Found You (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>The viewers and fans alike had banded together to formulate a plan of action. Meanwhile, the unsuspecting Director Zhao let loose a very loud sneeze. He was also running through the park at the moment and had no time to check the screen of his gadget. Therefore, he was blissfully unaware of the viewer’s scheming and could only hear someone report that Yu Yaoyao was catching up.</p>
<p>He urged Shen Yichong to rush. “We will take the shortest road,” he said, “Hurry. Move your legs a bit more.” Director Zhao turned a corner and took another path at the last minute. This path wasn’t indicated on the map, so he was sure that Yu Yaoyao would take the longer road.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, in the meantime, had deviated from the road on the map and taken a different path. The staff were reporting it in a low voice to the director. The staff thought that both would clash, and the game would be over.</p>
<p>“Mommy, go slower,” said Shen Rui, who felt bad that his mum was panting as she ran carrying him. “Dad has long legs anyway. We can’t beat him by running. So, take your time.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright, baby,” said Yu Yaoyao, “We will be fine. We just need to reach the next destination soon. Mommy is a little impatient.” Yu Yaoyao took a look at the map. “As long as we follow this path, we will get there on time.”</p>
<p>“But mommy,” said Shen Rui, uncertainly, “Is this the right way?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at the map a while longer and nodded. “Yes, baby,” she assured him, “The arrow on the map tells us to go north, right?” She showed him the map. “We will be walking north from here so we will reach the destination ahead of time.”</p>
<p>The staff grimaced, hearing this. The viewers were unsure with Yu Yaoyao’s decision. They expressed their doubts in the comments but some fans who resided in the City B had good news for the others:</p>
<p><strong>【Sis, this seems to be wrong. This isn’t north…. 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Is my sis weak with directions? 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Haha! A native City B resident here. The path on the map should be a longer route that the program team chose. My sis is actually going in the direction that goes straight to the ticket booth in the Boat-Rowing Area! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 So, my sis got lost, and somehow landed on the right path! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Are my sis’ flaws always so perfect? 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【YYY: I can’t read a map, so I’ll just go the opposite way! Director, are you scared yet? 】</strong></p>
<p>This added to the already funny situation of the broadcast till now. However, Yu Yaoyao suddenly froze.</p>
<p>“Baby, I think I smell your dad’s cologne,” said Yu Yaoyao, sniffing the air.</p>
<p>Shen Rui was surprised. He raised his little head and looked around. This time, there was no mint candy. It was definitely dad! The next second, Shen Rui’s eyes went wide, and he hurriedly pointed towards the bridge nearby.</p>
<p>“Mom, I can see dad!” he exclaimed, “He is right there!”</p>
<p>The staff were startled. The viewers were aghast. Shen Rui slid off Yu Yaoyao’s back and trotted along with his little backpack bouncing. He jumped and clung to the staff’s legs. “Mommy, go save daddy,” he said hastily, “I will hold him in place. Go! Hurry!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes lit up. “Alright, baby,” she said, “You stay here and wait for me.” The next moment, she bolted out of there and ran at full speed towards Shen Yichong and the Director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Director Zhao was facing another problem. The number of people around and inside the park had grown drastically. Even the police and the security personnel were finding it difficult to hold them back. He had a bad feeling about all of it when he saw a familiar figure bounding towards them from meters away.</p>
<p>He tried to hurry from the place, but the people crowding around them blocked the way and refused to budge. He noticed that the throng parted to let Yu Yaoyao pass while holding them back.</p>
<p>“Sh*t!” Director Zhao cursed, frustrated on finding no way out. His head hurt. “Please move out of the way,” he said, “We are playing a game. Please and thank you.” It seemed to make a difference because the crowd parted a little, but many were still hovering around Shen Yichong intending to prevent him from leaving. Zhao Yu understood that this was cooked up by Yu Yaoyao’s fans to thwart his game. He tried to usher Shen Yichong through a small gap in the crowd when a crisp and stern voice rang out.</p>
<p>“Why are you still running?” Yu Yaoyao yelled, “Give me back my husband!”</p>
<p>This excited the gathered fans even more. Many whispered about how beautiful and formidable Yu Yaoyao looked. Others assured her that they had blocked Shen Yichong’s path. Director Zhao closed his eyes with the palm of his hands, feeling hopeless. He turned back to find Shen Yichong smiling affectionately as delicate hands found his waist from behind. “I found you,” said Yu Yaoyao tenderly.</p>
<p>Everyone present went uproarious with joy, and those who were still watching the live broadcast expressed their happiness by sending hearts and likes on the video.</p>
