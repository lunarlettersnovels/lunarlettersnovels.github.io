            <p><strong>Chapter 353</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>The original owner of her body had landed her in a huge predicament. The original owner was so dumb and pitiful. The story turned out the way it had partly because of the bad intentions of the others, and partly because of her disappointing character.</p>
<p>This trashy Chen Jiao hadn’t even wanted to look at her back then. Why did she stay so loyal to him? She even called him Brother Jiao…</p>
<p>Her mind was still swaying when she was already married. In the end, she got nothing in return. Now she had left her a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>“Darling!” Yu Yaoyao felt that even her wit couldn’t help her in coming up with a reasonable solution this time.</p>
<p>Bro Jiao… That was already a good enough name for Chen Jiao! Why did she have to use Brother Jiao? Was she afraid that the others would know that she had someone else in her heart? Was she not afraid that her husband would find out she was having a mental affair?</p>
<p>Oh God!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately handed her phone to Shen Yichong. “Darling, I swear to God that I have never contacted him! It’s him who sent a text message to me. He must be trying to get me on hot search again! He is just terrible!”</p>
<p>After looking at his mother and father, Little Bun finally realized he may have done something bad. He immediately covered his face.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squinted his dark eyes a little. He got up from the sofa, leaned over her, held out her phone and pressed it into her hand. “I’m not reading it.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her head and pouted.</p>
<p>In the next second, Shen Yichong pinched her pinkish cheeks. “I know there is nothing between the two of you. You don’t have to prove it to me,” as Shen Yichong spoke, his calm, deep, dark eyes glanced at her phone screen again. “I trust you,” his voice was unusually warm.</p>
<p>“Darling,” Yu Yaoyao felt so moved by his words. She reached out her hand, hugged him, and she gave him a loud kiss on the face.</p>
<p>Little Bun also wanted a kiss. He said, “I believe in Mommy too!” he put his face closer to her as he said this.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately turned her head and gave him a kiss. Little Bun squinted his eyes and gave a big smile.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stared fiercely at the text message. She wanted to delete the contact. But after giving it some thought, she clicked to change the name. She changed it from ‘Brother Jiao’ to ‘Gangster Jiao’.</p>
<p>If she were to delete his contact, his contact would show up as a stranger’s number when he sent another message or something. Then it would look fishy. Perhaps she should block him… But after some thought, she didn’t.</p>
<p>“Darling, this dude is a gangster. I think there is a huge chance he is trying to land us in trouble,” Yu Yaoyao said, stopping Shen Yichong from going back to reading documents. “I won’t block him for now, in case it backfires when he gets pushed to the extreme. It will still be under our control if anything goes wrong.”</p>
<p>If Chen Jiao knew all the facts, he wouldn’t continue to try and harm her. Yu Yaoyao felt this was how it should go, according to common sense. But who knew if he would be over-stimulated and suddenly go crazy? Who could she hold accountable for the ruin of her beautiful appearance, if by any chance, he got so angry that he splashed sulfuric acid on her, or begged her to die with him?</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched when he looked down at Chen Jiao’s new name on her phone and listened to what she said. “He is a man whose reason is greater than emotion. He knows what he wants most, but he won’t do anything to jeopardize his future.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted, “You think so?” She was unsure. Chen Jiao had very few scenes in the novel. He always created scenes where Ling Shuang would interact with Shen Yichong, over and over again. “I think he has a gloomy character, and his morals are a little bit corrupt. He seems to have no bottom line. All he has is bad ideas in his brain. He’s still trying to hook up with me, even though I’m married now! Though I must commend him on his taste, I won’t let his wish be granted! Does he think I am such an easy target who will fall for him because of his good looks? Ha! Trying to depreciate my personality! Only in his dreams. He would never get me in this life!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched again as he watched his wife getting excitable. He stretched out his hand, clasped it around her shoulder and patted her comfortingly. But halfway through the motion, he raised his eyebrows. “That sentence sounds a little familiar…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao giggled, “Darling, it’s my new line! It was a line that I came up with after I discussed the script with the screenwriter yesterday!” she proudly puffed up her chest. “My dear screenwriter said that I am super smart, and I will become popular if I become the writer of these kinds of plots.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pinched his nose, “Are you sure?” his usually calm voice pitched upwards, and he looked as though he wanted to frown.</p>
<p>She always said shocking things, even when she wasn’t planning on writing a novel. If she really did write one… He didn’t even want to think about it.</p>
<p>Though he never usually read those online novels, the investment department had always been looking to invest in decent romance dramas. So, he did know a few good pieces of work on the potent CEO theme.</p>
<p>He didn’t even want to listen to some of the worst ones; A storyline where a president of the company escaped with his pregnant mistress secretary was already outdated. Now, the character had to remove his kidney to save his sister…</p>
<p>Every time he heard these introductions at the meeting, he felt that the girl who was recommending these pieces was crazy. Her eyes would light up, and she would become extremely excited when she talked about them.</p>
<p>Last month, she had even proposed to invest in a drama with lesbians in a school theme. Both the female leads were both great in their own field. One was the smartest student in the school, and the other was the most powerful, popular student in the school.</p>
<p>He gave up the voting rights at the investment meeting.</p>
<p>He respected the girl’s taste, but really, he didn’t understand what about these ideas interested her much!</p>
<p>If Yu Yaoyao also wrote about such these things…Well, a CEO was acceptable, but if the theme was about gays and lesbians… Shen Yichong felt a headache coming on just thinking about it.</p>
<p>He grabbed her hand, that was about to start typing up her brand-new novel. “It takes a lot of typing to write a novel, and your hands will be sore and tired. I think… It’s like hundreds of thousands of words.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately dismissed the idea when she heard this. She was a person who wanted to be able to go lie down whenever she wanted. The screenwriter had also told her that she was losing a lot of hair, and she was going bald from staying up late to write scripts. It was scary.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao shrunk her neck between her shoulders when she heard this. “Forget it then. I’ll just read the stories other people write.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded, “Right. If you have an idea, just tell the screenwriter. Let them do the work.”</p>
<p>As a husband, he had no objection to his wife pursuing her own career and interests. But he swore to God that if she were to write a book, she would be so excitable every day and end up on the hot search. He wouldn’t even be surprised by it.</p>
<p>“Screenwriter Liu also has an idea for an urban romance drama. You can talk to her if you are so bored,” Shen Yichong said, betraying Liu without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Okay! Thank you, Darling!” Yu Yaoyao said as she grabbed Shen Yichong’s arm and shook it happily.</p>
