            <p><strong>Chapter 316 – Slave Husband (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>With the closure of the crew, and Yu Yaoyao’s outcry and refusal of any interview, her fans had absolutely no idea what she was doing. This struck up sudden activity from a group of YY fans. They started posting questions on social media.</p>
<p>[<em>Teacher Wei, have you seen our Yaoyao?]</em></p>
<p>[<em>Teacher Wei, could you please bring our Yaoyao along when you start getting back into work? Don’t let her stay at home anymore. If you see her, can you tell her not to cry anymore? We are all so worried.</em>]</p>
<p>[<em>Sorry, I really have no intention of mentioning someone else on your Weibo, but really… I too am worried about Yaoyao… May I ask how she’s doing?]</em></p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao wasn’t deliberately hiding from the public. She was just under the strict supervision of two men from her family after the incident. They had made sure she was taking care of her throat, sleeping more, drinking more water and resting. Whenever she was in a hotel during these two days, Shen Yichong would confiscate her mobile phone to prevent her from worrying about the Internet.</p>
<p>On-set, she was also working hard on filming. She would read professional books from time to time to help her and if she still didn’t understand, she would ask the female lead to help her out. With all of this going on, she completely forgot about the gold-diggers and disappeared from the Internet. And because of this, she became the center of everyone’s concern.</p>
<p>Wei Ming, who was resting among the crew, did not expect his Weibo that said ‘I want to be a changed man,’ to be such a hot search! He had always been a senior actor who didn’t have much traffic on his SNS. He also always kept under the radar, and his fanbase couldn’t compare to those of the younger artists. Now, he was feeling totally overwhelmed by the attention. Wei Ming was also fascinated. As he was an uncle who hardly interacted with fans, he got instantly excited when he saw all the fans who cared about Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>He ended up personally joining the thread. He wrote:</p>
<p><em>[Alright. I will convey the message to you guys. I have spoken to your Yaoyao. Yaoyao has inspired me to better myself and deepen my knowledge. She is very dedicated, professional, and strong. I have learned a lot from her.]</em></p>
<p>His post made her YY fans extremely excited. It didn’t take long before they started answering:</p>
<p><em>[@YuYaoyao, thank you so much. I wish to learn from you more in the future, if there is a chance!]</em></p>
<p>Before the fans left Wei Ming’s official blog, they thanked him personally. Then, they started a thread in which they highly praised Yu Yaoyao:</p>
<p>[<em>A strong queen!]</em></p>
<p>[<em>Angel-kissed face, the perfect body, and a heart of gold!]</em></p>
<p>[<em>Dedicated!]</em></p>
<p>[<em>Gosh, I really want to see my strong husband. I want to swim on Yaoyao’s collarbone!]</em></p>
<p>[<em>Yaoyao, keep focused on what you have to do. We will take care of the debt collection and apology!]</em></p>
<p>Reading through the thread, Wei Ming couldn’t help but think that Yu Yaoyao had some sensible fans indeed.</p>
<p>And just like that, YY fans on the Internet were happy again. Their perseverance in asking for an apology and debt repayment from the Yu family became ever more determined.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The only reason Yu Yaoyao knew about what happened online was from Ni Yi, who was there to pick her up when she finished work. She had originally planned to go online and chat with everyone, but in the end, she could only hurriedly leave a post that said, ‘I’m okay,” mostly due to the charming fragrance of chicken soup coming from her hotel room. The smell made her salivate.</p>
<p>Without waiting for Ni Yi to finish reporting on her work, Yu Yaoyao excitedly opened the door of the room and went in, leaving Ni Yi without an explanation.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was wearing a half-buttoned white blouse. Both sleeves were rolled up, revealing half of his stunning wheat-coloured arms. His expression was serious as he dealt with the pot of soup on the coffee table. Next to the pot was a plate of her favorite chicken thighs and wings.</p>
<p>“Darling! Chicken!” Yu Yaoyao blurted, enchanted by the smell.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his head and saw her excited expression. With a loving smile he said, “Go wash your hands and come drink some soup. This is a hen, not a rooster.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gave a quick nod and rushed to the bathroom. She quickly cleaned her hands and returned to sit obediently on the sofa next to Shen Yichong like a chick waiting to be fed. She kept staring at the pot on the coffee table as if her eyes could see through it and to the contents inside. Her mouth kept salivating.</p>
<p>She couldn’t really be blamed for her temptation. She had only been eating boxed lunches ever since she’d started filming. She used to think that the ribs and chicken thighs in the box lunch were a delicacy. But recently, she no longer felt that way.</p>
<p>In addition to having so many NGs from Qi Hang, the boxed lunches were already cold when it reached her. When the food was cold, the flavor suffered. She was now a little more picky with food after being fed by Shen Yichong. She no longer said yes to just any food that had meat.</p>
<p>“Darling, you are so good to me!” Yu Yaoyao said, “I thought I was in heaven the moment I opened the door… I’m so happy,” she had never expected Shen Yichong to make chicken soup in her hotel room. It was a super surprise.</p>
<p>“Just drinking chicken soup can make you feel like you’re in heaven?” he said with a smile on his thin lips. He opened the pot, scooped a bowl of soup and handed it to her. He watched as she sipped at it.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was never disappointed by good food and a hard working chef.  She parted her red lips, blew the spoon carefully and drank it. Her eyes brightened instantly. The tiredness that had shown on her face after a whole day of filming disappeared.</p>
<p>“It’s delicious! Superbly, perfectly delicious! Darling, you’re amazing!” Yu Yaoyao said in one breath. Then she picked up the small bowl and drank the rest of the soup.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stretched out his hand to help organize her scattered bangs and push them behind her ears. “Yu Xinjie transferred 3 million to the account today,” he said. “And Yu Jianghai also contacted me. He said he would transfer another 2 million over tonight,” he’d stopped addressing Yu Jianghai as his father-in-law, “For the remainder of the money, he is intending to sell the beauty salon, but he has not found a buyer yet. If you like, we could take over it first, if you want all the cash. He hopes for a grace period of two days.”</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao had finished drinking her bowl of warm chicken soup, she felt content and her mood had also improved. She laughed when she heard that only one-tenth of the 30 million was paid back, “Darling, what do you think?”</p>
