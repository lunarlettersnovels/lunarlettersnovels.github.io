            <p><strong>Chapter 440</strong></p>
<p>Ye Yun’s eyes widened. Maternity leave? Mr. Shen will be taking maternity leave for a month?! He was really a wonderful man who would take good care of his family! For the sake of his wife and daughter, even making money was put in second priority!</p>
<p>Guangxin really didn’t care about earning money, huh?</p>
<p>After Ye Yun came to this conclusion, she hesitated again. Changing jobs was not an easy decision. In particular, several key issues such as company strategy, boss character, self-development, and remuneration need to be slowly measured and considered. But after starting paying attention to this issue, Ye Yun had increasingly discovered that Guangxin was really remarkable.</p>
<p>Before, she was just a fan of Yu Yaoyao. But now that she paid more attention to the company, she found that many film and television dramas invested by Guangxin had basically achieved good results. Although Chen Jiao had left the company, there were still many well-known rookies and experienced artists that belonged to Guangxin.</p>
<p>Even the winners of the best rookie award, best supporting actor and actress awards were all from Guangxin. If it continued to work well next year, it was very likely that the best actor and actress awards would go to Guangxin!</p>
<p>It was almost impossible for several other large domestic entertainment companies to compete with Guangxin. Shen Yichong started his entertainment career relatively late, and he was not the first to make a fortune, but she couldn’t deny his good foresight.</p>
<p>Many pillars that were supporting Guangxin today, as well as popular films and music works were discovered by him, along with the investment department and strategy department. With such a boss, she could definitely learn a lot. She might even be able to do a big business without being tied up at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ye Yun originally thought that Shen Yichong was not very capable of managing the company. But after researching, she discovered that he had all the professionals helping him with the management. Several department leaders in the company were very well-known in the industry. In addition, the company not only had experienced seniors, they also had new entrants. This ensured that the company’s strategies would have innovative breakthroughs without losing a steady pace.</p>
<p>Ye Yun could only admire how the company functioned.</p>
<p>During Yu Yaoyao’s confinement, Shen Yichong did not even go to work for a day.</p>
<p>But Ye Yun, who paid attention to the new developments in the entertainment industry, found that Guangxin had invested in four or five works during this period. They also had investment intentions in more than a dozen works. In addition, it also cooperated with several TV stations for variety shows. The company’s performance was not stalled just because of Shen Yichong’s rest.</p>
<p>Ye Yun finally sent a private message to Chen Lin on the day when Yu Yaoyao was out of her confinement.</p>
<p><em>[I’m willing to give it a try.]</em></p>
<p>However, when she was free, Shen Yichong had no time. He decided to accompany his wife for another month of confinement. He even had to record a ‘Welcome to My Home’ program for his wife who could not go out.</p>
<p>Chen Lin arranged an interview with the HR supervisor for her and took her to meet with the leaders of several departments. The interview with Shen Yichong could be done virtually.</p>
<p>Ye Yun really surrendered to Mr. Shen.</p>
<p>If Mr. Shen could help his wife give birth to a baby, he definitely would!</p>
<p>The doubt in her heart could only be answered when he came back.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the other side, Shen Yichong, who Ye Yun considered a model husband of the century, took his son to a beautiful and unknown town next to the Grand Canyon. The father and son took their luggage and lived in the small thatched house arranged by the program team.</p>
<p>‘Welcome to my house’ suddenly became ‘Dad Where Are We Going’…</p>
<p>As usual, Shen Yichong has to conduct a live broadcast according to the requirements of the program group. However, his goal this time was obviously not high and was far less aggressive than before.</p>
<p>“There’re only the two of us for lunch. We’ll have scrambled eggs, chicken wings and rice. In the evening, we’ll boil noodles with vegetables. A budget of 100 Yuan should be enough.”</p>
<p>He was now different from the person who was working hard to be able to buy steak for his wife. Little Bun Shen Rui had no complaints either. He didn’t care anymore since his mommy was not there.</p>
<p>If the guests wanted to eat, they could cook their meals themselves. Having chicken wings was enough for him. Since he was tiny, he would get indigestion from eating too much.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu had a headache looking at the father and son. He couldn’t think of a way to deal with the two. He didn’t knew that the father and son would be so incompetent in Yu Yaoyao’s absence. He thought they would show their lavish lifestyle, but it was going to end with boiled noodles with vegetables?</p>
<p>How would such a show be attractive?</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was going bald!</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao had just been released from her confinement, and her second baby was still an infant. It was impossible for them to join the show. Shen Yichong agreeing to bring his son with him already showed him his respect. But without Yu Yaoyao, the father and son weren’t even funny anymore.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was sweating profusely. He had no choice but to intervene as the director. Separated interviews were conducted on the father and son who were doing their own things as soon as they arrived at the cabin.</p>
<p>“Little Rui, why don’t you play with your dad?”</p>
<p>Little Bun looked up and gave him a blank look, “Uncle director, my daddy is much older than me. We can’t play together. My dad would surely find the games I like boring, and I don’t understand the stuff that my dad thinks is fun.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was speechless.. But this was a family show! How can there be no warmth at all?! Were they so realistic? Zhao Yu didn’t know what to reply!</p>
<p>“Then you are often alone at home? Are you looking forward to having a visitor later?”</p>
<p>Little Bun shook his head with a small smile on his face, “There is a mommy at home, and now there is a little sister. I’m not alone. I don’t look forward to having a guest, my sister is cuter.”</p>
<p>“Uh, then who do you think your little sister likes best?”</p>
<p>Little Bun gave Zhao Yu a complicated look, “It must be my mom, who has milk.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>This show couldn’t even be recorded! Zhao Yu felt so tired.</p>
<p>“But of course, I’m her second favorite.” After finishing a building block, Little Bun straightened his chest. “My younger sister likes me the most after my mommy.”</p>
<p>On the other side, Shen Yichong, who was also asked the same question by the director, had just raised the corners of his mouth. “Of course, my baby daughter likes me more. There’s no doubt.”</p>
<p>Sparks from both father and son exploded fiercely across the wall!</p>
