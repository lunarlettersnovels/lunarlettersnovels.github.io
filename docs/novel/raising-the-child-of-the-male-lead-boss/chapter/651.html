            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 100 – Video Call</strong></p>
<p>As soon as the little bun saw the call flash through the screen, his dimmed eyes suddenly turned bright with delight. The previous bleakness in them became unseen; the sad, abandoned expression was completely gone as if It had never been there before.</p>
<p>Excitement and joy were all that came to his little face as he thought, Mommy’s calling!</p>
<p>The little bun was on all fours, his belly on the soft mattress as he prepared himself. He pulled on his wrinkled clothes and checked himself all over. But halfway through his inspection, his grin disappeared as he fixed his father an unexpected mourning look.</p>
<p>“I didn’t wear the dragon pajamas mommy bought for me…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, “You need to change your clothes always and have it washed. Dad will go to the mall and buy new sets for you.”</p>
<p>The little bun still felt forlorn, especially since it was a gift from his mother. With his father’s promise to buy him new ones, he wasn’t quite interested. Quickly after, he still managed to perk up and soon moved to fix the hair on his head.</p>
<p>“Dad, am I cute now?” the little bun asked as his big eyes looked eagerly towards his dad.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth dropped further! His son is developing a vain demeanor, perhaps learning a little too much from his mother, who is only concerned with her appearance when she goes out and takes selfies. Did this woman even teach his child something good?</p>
<p>“You are a boy. You are okay.”</p>
<p>Of course, the little bun was not satisfied with this taciturn answer from his dad. After all, this was his first time talking to his mother-no, video chatting! If he’s not cute enough, he won’t be able to leave a good lasting impression on his mother. So, will his mommy still call him tomorrow if this was the case?</p>
<p>He held the tablet down and quickly perused the mirror on the bedside drawer to look himself, caring to pose for imaginary selfies. Only after a while was he then satisfied with the way his hair looked. He also checked that his pajamas and face were clean. Finished with his grooming, he finally pressed the answer button with his short, stubby fingers.</p>
<p>Upon accepting the invitation for a video call, Yu Yaoyao’s small, v-shaped face immediately appeared on the screen. She looked like she had just come from the shower with some wet black hair still scattered on her shoulders, like the fascinating seaweed floating in the sea. Her skin was also translucent like water, water which, too, was bright and glistening. Most importantly, she was wearing the dinosaur pajamas she specially brought to the set.</p>
<p>The pink, one-piece thick pajamas did not ooze with her usual sexiness, instead, it added a bit of childishness, making her seem youthful and cute—it was quite the playful charm.</p>
<p>And when Shen Yichong took a glance at the screen, his tight nerves became wholly relaxed. This dinosaur onesie is more pleasing to the eye than her usual…silk pajamas. It looks like after she went out, she was still low-key with the way she dresses. She didn’t proudly show off her assets, or revealed her long legs…</p>
<p>He could not help but breathe a sigh of relief. But with a sudden, intrusive thought, he felt a wave of ridiculousness wash over him. Why was he so concerned with the way she dressed? There was a secret hidden deep inside his heart… he doesn’t want other men to see the curves under her clothes. This thought utterly surprised him.</p>
<p>After all, he had never been so concerned with Yu Yaoyao before.</p>
<p>But soon, the little bun’s surprised cry and shy, but blaming voice pulled him back from his reverie.</p>
<p>“Mommy, my dragon pajamas are still dirty because of my father, so I had it washed first…I will wear it tomorrow!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao giggled, a sincere smile suddenly appearing on her delicate face as she listened to the little bun turn his father into a scapegoat. But soon, eager eyes looked towards Shen Yichong; the former playfulness now held a flirtatious light. It was a soft provocation, like a gentle wind that slowly entangled him.</p>
<p>“Baby, you shouldn’t blame your daddy.”</p>
<p>With an unexpected reprimand, the little bun’s fat face turned red. “I… dad took me outside to play with mud. It’s dirty, but dad just washed now…” Beside him, Shen Yichong touched his nose in tense silence.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at the discordant father and son in the video and laughed, rolling on the bed.</p>
<p>“Mommy, is your hand still hurting? Is it still bleeding?” the little bun smartly changed the subject.</p>
<p>“It’s all pretty good, my baby, it’s just a little itchy.” While she amicably chatted, there was a knock that came from the door. Afterward, the voice of an unknown man floated through her room.</p>
<p>“Hello, takeout.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s smile faltered a bit. Takeout? She hasn’t called for any.</p>
