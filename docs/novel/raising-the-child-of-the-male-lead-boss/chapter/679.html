            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 72 – Green Tea or White Lotus (2)</strong></p>
<p>Ni Yi wanted nothing more than to audibly swear at this! In front of so many people, Meng Xinran brushed a wave of goodwill, while ironically, by the way, insidiously reminding that his elder sister depends on her husband, who is the head of an entertainment company.</p>
<p><em>This girl is too poisonous!</em></p>
<p>“Sister Yu, you are the first-place contestant, naturally you will choose first among everyone. I will be last.” Meng Xinran’s beautiful face didn’t break from its façade of sweetness and respect. Therefore, no one could see anything unusual.</p>
<p>But Ni Yi’s blood continued to boil all the more! <em>This is too much, ah!</em></p>
<p>If the event that she gave up the second place and his sister, who is all the top contestant, refused, wouldn’t she be painted in a negative light, as a heartless person, unworthy of her spot?  Yet ultimately, if they lose this round, then it is equivalent to losing face as well! On the other hand, if they give up the first choice, then they will choose the last prop out of the 68 contestants–the difficulty factor has risen straight up.</p>
<p>As if the advantage from the preliminaries was kicked to the curb.</p>
<p>If they are eliminated, there will be no gratitude from these new talents. They would only feel that his sister only followed behind Meng Xinran so that she could show a modest face. And in the end, with her loss, it would mean that her skill was truly inferior to them and that she had only survived by holding the golden thigh of her CEO husband.</p>
<p>Ni Yi could only look pale and perspire with anxiety.</p>
<p>Everyone stood still, not knowing what to do when a clear voice sounded out, “Little Ran, you are breaking the rules of this round and making it very difficult for the director group.”</p>
<p>Dressed in a hip-hop sweatshirt, Qiu Dajian unexpectedly took the initiative to voice out his stand.</p>
<p>“You’d better listen to the director. Whether you get to choose first, or the way around—everything should be followed according to the rules of the program. You don’t want to be special by yourself.” Qiu Dajian, ranked third, belongs to a rival entertainment company. They never expected he would speak out against Meng Xinran.</p>
<p>Ni Yi finally wiped his sweat happily!</p>
<p>“Brother Dajian, what do you mean—are you saying that I’m doing this for my own benefit?” Meng Xinran smiling face slightly changed colors.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sister Ran is doing this for us.”</p>
<p>“Brother Dajian doesn’t want to choose last, does he?”</p>
<p>“I support sister Ran, and I am willing to give up the fifth place.”</p>
<p>“I also give up seventh place!”</p>
<p>There were nearly five or six top-ranked girls who stood together with Meng Xinran.</p>
<p>Seeing this brewing fiasco, the director group had to urgently negotiate between the contestants, “Then let’s settle it with a vote. If one agrees with the sequence, go over to the left side, otherwise, stand in the right side if you ant it reversed.”</p>
<p>The more conflicts and drama happen in the program, the more buzz it creates around the internet and raise their ratings, therefore the director is naturally happy with the unfolding situation.</p>
<p>After a while, almost everyone came to Meng Xinran’s side or took a neutral side. Whereas, only Qiu Dajian stood with Yu Yaoyao together with a little nervous girl. This girl was ranked 46th, and it was Zhao Xiaomeng, who was given the 88th position by Yu Yaoyao on the very first day.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng saw that most people had gone over the other side and her face became a bit ghastly. Only then when she looked at Yu Yaoyao’s serene face, did she stood stiff and refused to move her legs.</p>
<p>“Okay! Then according to the majority, props will be drawn at the reverse order,” the director group concluded.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was extremely calm. “I don’t care,” she uttered in reply.</p>
<p>In fact, she did not move from her seat from beginning to end, only watching the scene before her. She was too lazy to partake in something too…worthless–all done by a shady girl.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s eyes wanted to breathe fire for an instant, but she swallowed her rage and looked at Yu Yaoyao again with a sugary expression. “Sister Yu, you are very generous.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao merely shrugged her shoulders. She looked at the people standing around Meng Xinran and shook her head regretfully, leaving them confused and in a daze.</p>
<p>“Some people probably don’t know how wild animals hunt.” As she spoke, she chuckled, “Even a powerful tiger always hunts patiently, crawling on the grass and trees, out of sight from his prey. He waits for the moment when the prey he sees today relaxes…before he moves forward and <em>bites</em> the other party’s throat!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pursed her lips up, looking like a gentle spring.</p>
<p>However, the girls around Meng Xinran felt their flesh suddenly erupt into goosebumps, as if at this moment, a tiger was truly eyeing them!</p>
<p>“In nature, the most lethal thing is to relax our vigilance. The one who eats you is never the one who openly shows his teeth in front of you, but the one who lets you…relax!”</p>
<p>Yu yaoyao’s eyes swept over the crowd of young men and women. The girls opposite of her finally looked at Meng Xinran at a different light, trembling, their eyes showing their naked suspicion at this crafty plot.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, what are you talking about?” Meng Xinran’s face was stiff. “I just want to give everyone a fair environment!”</p>
<p>“Oh, it turns out that the director group was being unfair,” Yu Yaoyao bit back a second later, nodding solemnly.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran suddenly looked up, “No, that’s not what I meant!” Otherwise, she would have offended so many directors on the spot.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled and retorted, “Since you think the director group was actually fair, why then did you propose to change the rules?”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran ground her teeth, caught in a surprising dilemma. “I-I…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi, who was watching, clenched his fist instantly, and his fat face squeezed out a triumphant look!</p>
<p><em>Elder sister is right! Come on, slap her face! Suck the blood out of this shameless, little poisonous flower–let the scheming b*tch have it!</em></p>
