            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 153 – A CEO’s Hidden Talents (3) </strong></p>
<p>After her self-appraisal, she looked at Director Zhao Yu in admiration.</p>
<p>“This handsome and amazing director is incredibly good at seeking talent as he was able to find such a beautiful female artist for the show.”</p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu was left dumbfounded. For a moment, he was on cloud nine… just for a moment.</p>
<p><em>She is so cunning!</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong clutched his chin and took a deep breath. Soon, he also looked at the screen as he was attracted to the enchanting beauty of his wife.</p>
<p>He had happened to see a clip of this before, but because he was busy dealing with company shareholders and mergers, he had no time to focus on watching that scene. At that time, he was also full of worries, she was sick and had a cold and the child was around during the business meeting. This was also the first time he saw her performance on the big screen and noticed that even upon zooming in on her face, no imperfections were seen.</p>
<p>She was beautifully flawless!</p>
<p>She was also able to display the highlights and complexion of her whole body, for instance, her pair of shining eyes spoke more volumes on the big screen.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong did not stop her from enjoying her performance.</p>
<p>“Watch it closely and see if there are any shortcomings that could be improved in the future.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was sitting next to him and holding the cushion, raised her head in protest.</p>
<p><em>Why is it always not enough for him?!</em></p>
<p>Soon, she turned her head towards him and looked at his handsome face, who was watching the scene as well.</p>
<p>“Well, my husband, you are also watching carefully.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was thrilled by the exchange.</p>
<p>In this reality show, it was, of course, the best to be able to promote her previous show. Moreover, Mr. Shen had never commented on his wife’s performances ever. From the beginning, no one knew his opinion because he wouldn’t accept any interviews.</p>
<p><em>Today’s recording is absolutely exclusive!</em></p>
<p>Zhao Yu immediately ordered the cameraman next to him to take a close-up of Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>This time, the scene on the TV had gotten to where the film emperor Chen Jiao appeared. On the screen, Chen Jiao looked sour, he grabbed Yu Yaoyao’s arm and questioned her.</p>
<p>Everyone suddenly sensed a change in temperature inside the room. An extremely icy drop!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face obviously turned black. Even his fists were clenched, momentarily, and his lips pursed as if he was tolerating some kind of clamoring displeasure.</p>
<p>This was akin to subjects fearing their king seeing something unpleasant!</p>
<p>Then, Yu Yaoyao’s delicate voice was heard from the TV.</p>
<p><em>‘I like Chen Jiao? But I am already married to you.’</em> Her voice was inherently soft, with a trace of grievance, and she definitely had that power to stir people’s hearts.</p>
<p><em>‘I have given you the most precious and most beautiful things in the world… but why?’</em></p>
<p>Complaints of resentment and reluctance rang out clearly in the living room as the staff was also engrossed in that scene.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who has been watching the scene with cold eyes, finally moved his lips and looked at Yu Yaoyao with a gloomy expression. However, his expression turned gloomier the moment the behind the scene photoshoot of his wife during makeup session was flashed when the episode was finished.</p>
<p><em>‘If you start an entertainment company, I will become the queen of that entertainment circle and will accompany you to the highest peak!’ </em>Her sweet delicate voice had become unusually sonorous, like a boiling magma inside a volcano erupting into his relaxed yet cold heart.</p>
<p>His cold-heart was stirred, making his chest snap with indescribable numbness. He squinted to her side and saw her small, fair face and her misty eyes look the same as usual.</p>
<p><em>But… to speak that way? She could not even do that five years ago.</em></p>
<p>Even though he had watched the program once and heard it again, he couldn’t help but reach out to her and venture to kiss her as he felt warm inside. However, he came back to his senses, and eradicated those thoughts.</p>
<p>“Wow, husband, what a precious and dependable wife this is!” Yu Yaoyao, who wanted to be a queen, held her chest and was stunned at that emotion.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was speechless and only scrunched his eyebrows together. But before he could overcome his mood, another young and tender voice, that came from behind him, was heard.</p>
<p>“Precious Mommy! My Mommy is the best~ Yehey! How come there is such an excellent and amazing Mommy in the world~” Little Bun loudly cheered for his Mom.</p>
<p>“Mommy is the queen, Ruirui is the prince!” From behind the sofa, a hairy little head popped up, revealing a small and cute face, looking shyly towards the front row of the cameras.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a deep breath and began to rub his temples, attempting to ease away his new dilemma.</p>
