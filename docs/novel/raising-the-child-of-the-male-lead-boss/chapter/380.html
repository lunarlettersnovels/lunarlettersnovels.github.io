            <p><strong>Chapter 383</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>The producer released the trailer of ‘Allure’ for marketing purposes that morning.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao hadn’t bothered to pay any attention to specific details about the project. The main investor was Wansheng, and he had personally invested 20 million Yuan into the project.</p>
<p>When he received news earlier this morning that said Yu Yaoyao would be filming, he couldn’t wait to visit her. He also wanted to invite her to star in ‘Emergency Moment’. He could think of nothing but her. And since he was so confident in his major investment in ‘Allure’, he didn’t bother paying any attention to the feedback on the trailer.</p>
<p>But just before Yu Yaoyao started filming, the person in charge of Wansheng sent him a message saying that the situation was looking grim.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t everyone excited and looking forward to it?” Chen Jiao said in a high, frantic voice.</p>
<p>His assistant hesitated and did not dare speak. He just passed his phone over to Chen Jiao so he could see for himself.</p>
<p>The internet was almost exploding.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao quickly singled out a criticism comment at the very top of the thread:</p>
<p><em>[Holy shit. What a dumb screenwriter! Return my brother Qin Mu to me! He’s a soft gentleman. Who is this fat, greasy man in the trailer?]</em></p>
<p><em>[My brother Jin has a calm, indifferent personality, but now he is being forced to play a cool, proud character? Is that really such a mild edit? Are you sure you didn’t rewrite the script entirely?]</em></p>
<p><em>[I really wanna beat the director to death after watching this trailer! Stupid director! What was supposed to be a fantasy movie has now become a romance! I’ll kill you!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Are you serious about the dress and headwear of the heroine? She looks like a pink sand sculpture!? Do you think this is a Disney fairy tale? Do you?!]</em></p>
<p><em>[What the hell is this! I find the changes too drastic after watching the trailer. As a big fan of the novel, I wouldn’t accept it!]</em></p>
<p><em>[On behalf of myself, I will never watch this. I don’t want it ruining the classic for me.]</em></p>
<p>Cold tickled up Chen Jiao’s spine when he saw the comments. It felt like someone had thrown a bucket of freezing water over his head. He scrolled down, flipping through dozens of different apps and screens. All the comments were bad reviews and curses.</p>
<p>The trailer of ‘Allure’ was on the hot search with more than 20,000 comments; all of them were criticism. There was nothing good.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao quickly went to check his fan page, only to find that there was more criticism there.</p>
<p>He froze, staring down at the picture of Gu Jin, one of the characters from the show that was being criticized. The fans were even picking on him. Many of his fans were also fans of the book, and they were all protesting.</p>
<p>Some of his fans were blaming his manager for picking out such a trashy script. They were asking whether his manager had just picked the role at random without reading the book first.</p>
<p>Some loyal fans and movie veterans who admired Chen Jiao’s acting skills criticized him for being unprofessional.  Even the manager of the fan page wrote a long paragraph criticizing him.</p>
<p><em>[Brother Jiao, I have always admired your acting skills, but what I have always loved about you the most is your seriousness and passion. Since when have you changed? The word ‘disappointed’ couldn’t even begin to sum up my feelings.</em></p>
<p><em>As an actor, shouldn’t you first do some research when you get the script? If it is a book that has been adapted, shouldn’t you also read the original book to get a better understanding of the characters?</em></p>
<p><em>I have to say that this remake is completely messed up. The screenwriter is guilty, the director is guilty, but aren’t the actors guilty as well? Brother Jiao, you have really failed this book and the characters. Anyone who has read the book knows the characters would never act like this!</em></p>
<p><em>I can’t believe the image I had of this work has now personally been ruined by my favorite actor! The pain in my heart cannot be put into words!</em></p>
<p><em>I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to threaten anyone or scold anyone, but I really can’t help it. Brother Jiao, I have grown up, but you haven’t. With this, I am now officially announcing that I am leaving the fandom.</em></p>
<p><em>Goodbye, Brother Jiao, the man I have admired for the past six years.]</em></p>
<p>This passage was the start of a larger movement. Many more fans announced that they were leaving the fandom.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao angrily threw the phone onto the car seat.</p>
<p>“Brother Jiao…” his assistant said softly.</p>
<p>Only then did Chen Jiao come back to his senses. His handsome face twitched. He tried his best to calm himself. “I’m sorry. There just so happens to be a new phone at the supplier. You can go and get it later.”</p>
<p>The assistant smiled awkwardly. “Thank you, Brother Jiao.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao gave his assistant back his phone and then immediately used his own to call Xu Hong.</p>
<p>In a low, anxious voice he said, “Have you seen the hot search on the Internet? What the hell is going on? What did Shen Yichong say when he withdrew his investment? I thought he withdrew because he knew he couldn’t beat Wansheng!”</p>
<p>‘Allure’ was considered one of the biggest projects of the year, especially considering the investments into the special effects lineup. It was a project based on one of the most popular books on the Internet. It was supposed to have an innate audience advantage.</p>
<p>In the beginning, several entertainment companies, famous film companies and companies from the general economy wanted to get a share in ‘Allure’. There was no way it could fail!</p>
<p>Guangxin and Wansheng Realty Group had competed to be the main investor in this project. The one with the biggest share in the project would get the largest benefit. The main investor also had the right to speak out in any aspect of the project. It even had the right to screen to other investors who wanted to participate.</p>
<p>As Chen Jiao thought about this, his eyes twitched.</p>
<p>When Guangxin withdrew its investment, he always felt that it was because of the strong assets Wansheng Realty Group had. Shen Yichong was a very clever man with a strong territorial consciousness.</p>
<p>Seeing that he couldn’t be the main investor, he had rather withdrawn his investment for other small projects that would give him higher returns. That is what Chen Jiao had always thought!</p>
<p>“Xu Hong, what exactly did Shen Yichong say at the investment conference! Did you not give me the full message?” By now, Chen Jiao was covered in cold sweat.</p>
<p>Guangxin hadn’t pulled out the investment because they had no money, it was because Shen Yichong had no faith or interest in the project!</p>
<p>Xu Hong hesitated before he spoke. He knew what this was about, he had also seen the hot search. The investment project he’d had so much faith in, and had encouraged Shen Yichong to invest in, was a total failure. “Brother Jiao, I asked you to invest two million Yuan into the project for me! Why would I hide anything from you?” he said in one breath, barely able to breathe by the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>His words weren’t enough to express his pain. The project he had been so confident in was trash… Just as Shen Yichong had said it would be. Now he understood why Shen Yichong had scolded him at the meeting. “I told you everything Mr. Shen mentioned in the meeting. He was worried about the script and the characters. Did you say something to the director after that?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s heart raced at Xu Hong’s words. He had mentioned it to the director.</p>
