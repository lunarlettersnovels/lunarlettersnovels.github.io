            <p><strong>Chapter 375</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong thought that his wife was acting a little strange the next morning.</p>
<p>The previous night, he’d arrived home at around midnight. Not wanting to disturb Yu Yayao’s rest, he’d slept in the spare bedroom for most of the night.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, he found Yu Yaoyao and Ren Sitong sitting close together, whispering, and casting strange glances at him from time to time. They’d talked more over breakfast and kept looking at him repeatedly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong usually kept his emotions in check when there were strangers in the house. He also supported the fact that Yu Yaoyao kept making new friends. Since there was a possibility that she was going to a take a 1–2-month filming break, Shen Yichong knew he wouldn’t be able to stay at home with her every day.</p>
<p>So, he didn’t interrupt their whispered discussion. He even did what a good nanny dad would do; he made sure the children finished their breakfast, and then wiped each of their mouths clean.</p>
<p>Once the kids were settled, he was about to head up to the second floor to change into a work suit, but he stopped when Ren Sitong called him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, please will you help my kids get changed as well? Thank you!” she said in a casual tone.</p>
<p>“Okay.” The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>He usually changed Shen Rui’s clothes when they were at home. Changing two more kids shouldn’t be that hard. Like an adult duck followed by three ducklings, he and the children went up to the second floor.</p>
<p>Since Ren Sitong’s youngest daughter was only a little over a year old, she struggled to climb the stairs with her short legs. Once she reached the landing of the first staircase, she looked like she wanted to start crying for her mother.</p>
<p>Ren Sitong didn’t do anything; he obviously didn’t want to intrude in what was happening.</p>
<p>Shen Rui stopped and immediately went over to the little girl. “Little Huahua, don’t be afraid. Walk slowly with me. Grab the railing and lift your left leg. That’s it!” He pushed butt from behind, even helping her to lift her leg up.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong quickly picked the little girl up when he noticed the Shen Rui accidently almost pushed her over. He looked down at his son and pursed his lips before saying, “You can’t push her like that. Her legs aren’t as strong as yours, and she can’t hold onto the railing. It’s difficult for her to stand firmly if you push her.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui was shocked. He quickly apologized to the little girl.</p>
<p>Followed by Ren Sitong’s eldest son and Shen Rui, Shen Yichong headed upstairs with the well-behaved little girl in his arms. He found the clothes Ren Sitong had left out on the sofa and first changed the sweet little girl.</p>
<p>Shen Rui already knew how to put his pants on by himself. With his buttocks bare, he hurried to help brother Ren when he saw he was struggling to put his jumper on.</p>
<p>After helping each other out, the four- and five-year-old little boys were finally dressed for kindergarten.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong had gone upstairs, Ren Sitong leaned forward and whispered in Yu Yaoyao’s ear. “Your husband seems to like my daughter. He’s very good at taking care of children. I think he can handle two children alone. He’s much better than the dumb man in my family.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded. “My husband is quite capable. He is better than me at taking care of children.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong squinted her eyes for a moment. “Let him spend more time with my two little ones. Just leave them alone today. Let him take the kids to kindergarten later. Let him experience the joy of having two young children in the home. When he realizes that it isn’t that scary to have more than one child, he will be more cooperative with you in having a second. He might even become more anxious than you to have another kid.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao found she had to agree with Ren Sitong. She thought carefully about what her friend had said, and she realized that Shen Yichong had never asked to have a second baby. She was the one who’d been talking about it the entire time.</p>
<p>She would go to the hospital for an examination that day. If there was no problem, then she would want to send him for an examination as well. But if he refused to go and see the doctor, it would end up in a very embarrassing situation. So, just like Little Sisi had said, it was better to make him want another child.</p>
<p>“The man in my house wanted a daughter after he saw the little girls in other people’s houses. He said they were cute, no matter how many times he looked at them. Then he kept showing me pictures of all kinds of little girls, and he kept saying baby girls are adorable…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was even more persuaded to listen to her friend when she heard this. She could just imagine the stoic Shen Yichong becoming a sucker for having a daughter, and pestering her all day long to have one… It would be amazing.</p>
<p>“Okay, Little Sisi, I’ll take your advice,” she said.</p>
<p>Ren Sitong’s youngest daughter was indeed very cute. The pink dress she was wearing made her look like the soft petals of a lotus flower. It made her little cheeks seem pinker and more vibrant.</p>
<p>But not only was Shen Yichong taken by her, Shen Rui was utterly fascinated. Before he’d met her, he’d wanted a little brother to play with. But after seeing how soft and tender the little girl was, he’d changed his mind. Additionally, Ren Sitong’s oldest son had never captivated his interest, even though they were about the same age. When they were on good terms, they were friendly with each other, but as soon as their relationship turned sour, they’d fight over toys.</p>
<p>Shen Rui had fallen for the little girl’s cute, chubby cheeks.</p>
