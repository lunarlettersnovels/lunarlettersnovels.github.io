            <p><strong>Chapter 417</strong></p>
<p>She was still denying it strongly when Shen Rui said she was afraid of the hospital the day before. But the truth appeared immediately the next day!</p>
<p>Ever since Yu Yaoyao got up in the morning, her entire face was looking gloomy. She even seemed a little nervous.</p>
<p>“Do I have to draw blood again today, darling?” she asked timidly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded affirmatively, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Um…But I have just done it last time. Everything is good, there was no problem…”</p>
<p>“The situation is different every month. You can only learn about the subtle changes in your body if you draw blood. It has to be drawn.”</p>
<p>To Shen Yichong, there was no room for discussion on this matter. Yu Yaoyao’s sorrow was all written in her eyes. In the morning, even her favorite sunny-side-up egg couldn’t bring any excitement. It tasted like she was chewing wax. Shen Yichong’s expression softened a little. At the dinner table, he tried his best to think of a joke that could cheer his wife up.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole process, Ren Sitong and Da Fu had almost gotten internal injuries from the laughter they got. It could already be considered a horror story when Mr. Shen told jokes expressionlessly!</p>
<p>After Little Bun had a few bites of his food, he comforted his mommy, “It’s okay. It’ll be just a mosquito bite. I’ll sing to mommy by the side when the time comes.”</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room finally knew why Little Bun had to go accompany his mommy for the check-up. Yu Yaoyao, who seemed to not be afraid of anything, was really afraid of going to the hospital. She was afraid about everything that was related to needles.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Shen really couldn’t handle it. When his wife was afraid, Shen Yichong would also become extremely nervous, although he seemed calm. When Yu Yaoyao had to do a check-up, his appetite also deteriorated, as if he also had to go for a checkup himself. On the way to the hospital, Shen Yichong spent the whole process trying to divert Yu Yaoyao’s attention.</p>
<p>What was funnier was that even Ren Sitong and Da Fu had followed. Da Fu said that he knew a local doctor. If he was on duty today, they could request him to act softer when he drew blood from Yu Yaoyao. Ren Sitong, on the other hand, was comforting Yu Yaoyao as someone who had been through it.</p>
<p>“Darling, my legs are soft,” Yu Yaoyao complained. “Sigh…I really want to just give birth to the baby right away. I didn’t know being a mother would be so hard…It’s so tired being a human~”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao threw herself on Shen Yichong’s chest for a while before she got out of the car.</p>
<p><em>[Sigh, even I feel distressed! Everyone, please don’t call Yaoyao squeamish. A friend of mine is really afraid of needles. Every time she got shots or had her blood drawn, her heart would race, and her face would turn pale. They’re really scared!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Fear of hospitals, fear of injections.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Pregnant women really get their blood drawn all the time. I really didn’t want to even see the hospital during that period. I will choose to be a man if I’m reborn!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I could understand Yaoyao. When I gave birth to my son, I was also very strong. But when my second-born was a daughter, I became sensitive and fragile at that time. I heard it was because of the hormone imbalance? If you were already afraid of injections before, you’ll feel it stronger in this period.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao is still very brave. Although she is afraid, she still wants to give birth to another baby, super good mommy!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Every time I go for a physical examination, my heartbeat would go higher than 100!]</em></p>
<p>The live broadcast room was very lively today. People could rarely witness the daily life of idols; let alone the daily life of the idols they like. Moreover, Yu Yaoyao’s family was really funny.</p>
<p>After being comforted by her husband and son for a while, she had obviously succumbed. She knew it herself that she had to do the check-up. She quickly bargained as stepped out of the car.</p>
<p>“Darling, then I’ll have two potato chips later.” AS an afterthought, she added, “Original taste.”</p>
<p>“…Ok,” Shen Yichong agreed.</p>
<p>“Bigger ones.”</p>
<p>“…Then you have to walk 30 minutes more in the evening.”</p>
<p>“Okayy~”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong almost fainted from too much laughter. “Yaoyao, are you a puppy? You want a reward every time you do something right?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the audience in the live broadcast rooms were all laughing.</p>
<p>They soon entered the hospital. It wasn’t convenient to broadcast in the hospital because there were too many patients and medical staff. Shen Yichong put the live broadcast device in his pocket during the whole process, so everyone could still hear the sound.</p>
<p>After the doctor issued the blood test list, everyone heard the father and son comforting her again. Little Bun was busy diverting his mommy’s attention.</p>
<p>“Mommy, let me tell you a little secret.” He mysteriously lowered his voice. “Xiao Qing and Da Qing at home already know me. They seem to know my smell. They don’t bite me even when I put my hand in.”</p>
<p>As expected, Yu Yaoyao was distracted, “That’s because they are in a good mood, and they get delicious food every day. If they’re left hungry for a day or two, your little finger…hisss.”</p>
<p>Halfway through, she hissed. Her blood was obviously being drawn by that time.</p>
<p>“Mommy, do you think my sister would be afraid of snakes when the time comes. We shouldn’t let her get close to them, right?”</p>
<p>“By the way, mommy, can we have a puppy? Then I will play with it along with my sister~”</p>
<p>“I think big dogs are good-looking, majestic, and they can protect my sister. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Mommy, you can name it…”</p>
<p>Little Bun was talking all the time, while Shen Yichong was also talking to her.</p>
<p>“I’ve bought the potato chips.”</p>
<p>“Every time you come to the hospital, I’ll get Chen Lin to buy you a new flavor and store it at home.”</p>
<p>“He also bought other flavors and snacks. You can have them after you give birth to the baby.”</p>
<p>Even if the audience couldn’t see the picture in the live broadcast room, they were amused by the conversation between the family.</p>
