            <p><strong>Chapter 387</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Chen Jiao wanted to see Yu Yaoyao again. He was selfish last time, but this time, he wanted to speak to her as a fellow actor. He was so moved and attracted by her authentic, pure acting skill.</p>
<p>Compared to other famous, young actresses, Yu Yaoyao always showed such sincerity in her acting that the audience didn’t even realize she was acting. Such sincerity immersed the audience unknowingly into the plot.</p>
<p>As an actor who stood out from so many others, Chen Jiao had a clear vision; he wanted to work with her. Seeing her perform gave him a sense of excitement he hadn’t felt in a long time.</p>
<p>But as soon as Chen Jiao picked up his phone up to call her, he awkwardly put it down again. He was nervous. He knew Yu Yaoyao would more than likely turn him down.</p>
<p>Just as he was hesitating and thinking of giving up, his manager, Guo Li, called him, “Brother Jiao, I am here with an update regarding your instruction for me to contact Sister Yao’s side. I just found someone who quit his job because he is moving. I wanted to ask for the contact of the new person in charge, but I got big news instead.”</p>
<p>“Big news?” Chen Jiao raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Yes. I think he thought we were a media reporter. He asked for one million Yuan before sharing news with us,” Guo Li reported.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was stunned as he listened. “Such a large number? Why not rob a bank instead?”</p>
<p>Actually, there wasn’t much news in the industry that was worth spending a million Yuan on. It would be a hefty loss for any business to spend money on things like that; unless it was news that could ruin a top celebrity that had spent years building a reputation.</p>
<p>“Brother Jiao, the party seemed to be very confident in their news. It’s said that it won’t only ruin Sister Yao’s image, it will also affect Mr. Shen’s reputation as well. The one million is for exclusiveness. He is only selling the information to one party.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao narrowed his eye as he thought this through. Since it was something that could affect the couple so badly… Could it be that Yu Yaoyao was having an affair?</p>
<p>He clenched his fist. “Tell him one million is fine. But if the news has no value, no where on earth will hide him from my wrath. Send him the money right now and get me that news!”</p>
<p>Guo Li immediately did as he was told.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao walked up and down in the room, unable to settle down. He was filled with sorrow and joy at the same time.</p>
<p>If Yu Yaoyao was having, or had, an affair, she would definitely end up divorcing Shen Yichong and being single again.</p>
<p>But who was she having an affair with?</p>
<p>Chen Jiao frowned.</p>
<p>If she had cheated, that would mean she wasn’t only sleeping with Shen Yichong, but the other guy as well…</p>
<p>Panic gripped him as he thought of this. If that was the case, he would have to abandon her, since she was no longer the good girl he knew from before.</p>
<p>With his mind running wild, he wandered back and forth around the living room for more than an hour.</p>
<p>When the news from Guo Li finally came, he couldn’t help but be ecstatic with what he heard.</p>
<p>“What did you say? They have an agreement to divorce in two years’ time? It was signed last year, before she participated in ‘In the Limelight’?” Chen Jiao’s voice changed drastically as he spoke. He was so agitated that his voice became hoarse.</p>
<p>Guo Li’s voice came over the phone again, the words like beautiful music to Chen Jiao’s ears. “Well, he said that not long after she refuted the rumors of her suicide scandal, she made a deal with Shen Yichong. The two signed an agreement on the division of property. She took some real estate worth around 100 million Yuan, but she was asked that they maintain the image of husband and wife for two years. If some unfavorable scandal about the couple is exposed, she would have to pay a huge amount of money in compensation to Shen Yichong.”</p>
<p>“Then why don’t they divorce?” Chen Jiao asked.</p>
<p>“I think they chose not to divorce because of the child. Our source only heard a few words of this in the car. Whether or not it’s true…”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao had already lost focus on what Guo Li was saying. He could feel his adrenaline rising and his heart pounding wildly.</p>
<p>God was finally giving him a break! He always gave him hope whenever he felt like giving up!</p>
<p>It turned out that all the affections between Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao had been fake!</p>
<p>The interactions between her and Shen Yichong in front of the camera were just a show, and they were only trying to maintain the image behind the camera.</p>
<p>She didn’t love him. It was all just acting.</p>
<p>It made sense. Why had Chen Jiao not thought of this before?</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s mind was so clear at the moment that it felt like he had been enlightened.</p>
<p>How was the interaction between husband and wife in ‘Wife’ different from the interpretation in her TV series?</p>
<p>With just a simple bowl of ramen, Yu Yaoyao could acutely act out her thirst for love, and her warm heart with that large pair of watery eyes. How hard could it be for her to maintain the image of a husband and wife with Shen Yichong, or to occasionally have some intimate relations with him?</p>
<p>He was sure she would have no difficulty at all in acting out such things.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao patted his forehead as he thought of this. “Why didn’t I think of this before?”</p>
<p>She and Chen Jiao had met during ‘In the Limelight’. She was playing his wife at that time. When he mistrusted her, she had managed to make herself seem sorrowful and sad. She even managed to make herself look nostalgic, as though she missed his love.</p>
<p>If she could act like that when she was with him, she could definitely act when she dealt with Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Alright. I got it!” Chen Jiao hurriedly hung up the phone.</p>
<p>He tossed and turned all night, glancing at the time every so often. It wasn’t until the next morning that he finally overcame his fears and called Yu Yaoyao.</p>
