            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 142 – A Nimble Thief (1)</strong></p>
<p>After going out, Shen Yichong desperately wanted to send Yu Yaoyao to the film crew. Unfortunately, right now, he was confronted by the raging gaze of his son that seems to come from the deepest corners of his soul.</p>
<p>He pressed his eyebrows, knowing that he isn’t able to do anything about it and said, “I’ll wait for your class to finish, then let’s go see your mother together.”</p>
<p>The little bun’s mouth twitched and instantly formed a small radiant smile. Be that as it may, Shen Rui reluctantly nodded. Although he felt he had been incredibly wronged, he agreed to settle for the best.</p>
<p>“Okay,” he replied.</p>
<p><em>Oye~ </em>The little bun shyly turned around, covering his face as a sudden broad grin appeared.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Shen Yichong sent Yu Yaoyao to the ‘<em>In the Limelight</em>’ set and personally stayed behind to watch it. The appearance of the CEO of Guangxin Entertainment placed the whole crew under a lot of pressure. Even the great film emperor Chen Jiao, who serves as a judge, had to greet him with a smile and say hello. Shen Yichong faintly nodded his head in response.</p>
<p>The film emperor was not able to gain the CEO’s attention. From the beginning until the end, his focus was only fixated on Yu Yaoyao, who was not far from the front of the cameras.</p>
<p>It was another day and another filming location.</p>
<p>The on-the-spot production crew and staff simulated a shooting practice to improve film technicalities. The assistant director, on the other hand, was already holding the megaphone and explaining the new set of tasks to the contestants.</p>
<p>“Today marks the day of the birth of many notable films and television dramas. Specifically, we have contacted the cast of “North and South of the Great River,” which is currently coming to an end. The chief director of this film is Zhou Ying, a well-known judge.”</p>
<p>“All the players today will be extras in this movie,” the assistant director added.</p>
<p>“You will experience performing for vital scenes on the spot and be graded by director Zhou Ying himself with our other two judges,” he further included.</p>
<p>As soon as he was over with his direction, all the players competed with each other. Each tried to show their varied skills in acting. And after a few rounds of competition, there were only twenty players left.</p>
<p>“Everyone, let’s draw lots first.”</p>
<p>Compared to when he was a judge in the program group, Director Zhou Qiu was much more severe in the shooting scene.</p>
<p>“I will briefly talk about the show first. Everyone is going to act in the big scene where the Japanese entered a teahouse to search for people.” Director Zhou Ying stated.</p>
<p>“All of you will have his or her specific roles. Some are tea guests, some are servers, some are pedestrians outside the teahouse, and some will have distinct identities such as businessmen, Japanese soldiers, etc.,” he explained further.</p>
<p>“Everyone needs to make a performance in line with the characters and the plot in this scene. For example, a tea guest must demonstrate that era’s style of tea drinking. The tension and forbearance when being searched should be present, and the relief and anger of the Japanese after leaving.” As the director finished his statements, everyone had already completed the draw.</p>
<p>“Everyone! Pick up your clothes in the dressing room and then prepare. Wait for your part in the scene and then act.” The deputy director and the field manager said as they were also preparing the filming location for the scene.</p>
<p>After a while, Yu Yaoyao took a small note and separated herself from the rest of the crew and returned back to Shen Yichong with confidence.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t ask her for the role that she had drawn.</p>
<p>Ni Yi did his job directly as an assistant, and while attending to Yu Yaoyao, he nervously asked, “Elder sister, what role did you pick? Tea customer?”</p>
<p>The director just gave a detailed explanation, and the difficulty factor dropped in an instant.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao did not answer his assistant. Instead, she put the note directly in his assistant’s hand and left. Ni Yi looked down onto his palm. His face changed and shrieked inwardly while saying the role Yu Yaoyao, unfortunately, picked,</p>
<p>“<em>Thief</em>?!”</p>
<p>The role that Yu Yaoyao had picked is too unsuitable for actresses! And it is complicated for ordinary girls to act. Shen Yichong accidentally heard Ni Yi, which made his eyebrows furrow, and then he looked at Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Seeing her relaxed face but somewhat solemn eyes, he said, “If you feel like you have difficulties playing the role, you can communicate with the director before starting the scene. Don’t stress yourself.”</p>
<p>While in the set, it was reasonable for the directors and actors to talk in advance in order not to waste time, but to also allow the actor to get in character more appropriately.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao shook her head and said this with a determined face. “It’s not difficult, I can do it.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows in surprise. A thief was a role she had never played before. But by the next second, his shoulder suddenly became heavy as Yu Yaoyao’s soft body instantly fell to his side.</p>
<p>“The field attendant said that I have to wait at least two hours …. Husband, I’m so tired standing~.” Yu Yaoyao’s delicate voice drifted into his ears.</p>
<p>“My legs are sore… I want to lie down…” She added.</p>
<p>Standing next to the couple was Ni Yi, who wanted to search for a thief’s acting video to aid Yu Yaoyao in her role, but he suddenly bolted and fled to the other side.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took a deep breath. He reached out to Yu Yaoyao, grabbing her by the arm and lifted her soft body that had leaned on him without warning.</p>
<p>“Stand still.” Shen Yichong said firmly, “Waiting for one’s part on the set is an actor’s basic courtesy,” and sighed as pointed to the side.</p>
<p>“Look at the other players, and then at other group performers.” Just like teaching his son, he did not reason with her but added examples for comparisons instead.</p>
<p>“Persevere for now. You’ll have a therapeutic massage afterward when you go back to the hotel.”</p>
<p>But as soon as he finished talking, he lowered his head and saw Yu Yaoyao’s body leaning even deeper in desperation towards him as the pain and sorrow was reflected on her face.</p>
