            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 225 – Don’t Disturb Us At Night (1)</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, this villa was located at the foothills that had some distance from the downtown, and is not easily accessible to the public. Otherwise, this scene would make headlines by  tomorrow!</p>
<p>Chen Lin was sweating profusely, and he was clearly preoccupied to the point that he even forgot to open the door for Shen Yichong, who remained sitting in the car. It wasn’t until Shen Yichong who carried Yu Yaoyao on his back and stood next to the door and was looking at him coldly, did he start to notice his unfinished task. He then jumped out of the car and opened the door for them. He didn’t dare to say a word as he did so.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong got in the car, his eyebrows were scrunched together and looked at him worriedly, “Did all the reporters arrive?”</p>
<p>To be honest, the reporters did more than just “arrived”, they basically encircled the entire company, and their downtown villa which was easily accessible by the public was also surrounded by curious bystanders too.</p>
<p>Chen Lin answered immediately that everything was ready and that they were just waiting for Shen Yichong. After he told him this, he heard a dissatisfied scolding from his companion.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao turned Shen Yichong’s face to her directly, “Chen Jiao, it’s Chen Jiao again! Are you sure he is my rumored lover, not your secret lover?” She asked in an annoyed tone.</p>
<p>Chen Lin remained silent. He didn’t dare to look back, so he just closed his eyes and handed over the answered document that he previously prepared to the people seated at the backseats. He didn’t dare to turn, not even one glance as he drove.</p>
<p>When they arrived at Guangxin, the paparazzi that had been waiting in the cold ran to them as if they were in a race! They hadn’t even opened the door yet but the paparazzi came in front of them, placed their microphones against the door and blocked their way.</p>
<p><em>“Mr. Shen, why are you so late in dealing with urgent situations?”</em> A reporter started to ask them.</p>
<p><em>“Is Chen Jiao not considering a lethal strike for Guangxin</em>?” Another one queried.</p>
<p><em>“What do you plan to do to overcome this crisis? Will Guangxin withdraw from the market?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Are all the investments in the first quarter going to be withdrawn?”</em></p>
<p>Many people kept throwing questions at them.</p>
<p>However, after the door opened, the owner of the leg that stepped out surprised them all! And the next second, camera flashes lit up like crazy and the area was filled by shutter noises.</p>
<p>The person who was covered in a large men’s suit was in fact, a petite and pretty woman.  It was Yu Yaoyao who stepped out of the car first! But she only managed to get one leg out, for someone quickly pulled her back and kept her inside the car.</p>
<p>Then, Shen Yichong stepped out with a gloomy face.</p>
<p>The flashing of lights went crazy, clearly the paparazzi got excited instantly by the sight of him.</p>
<p><em>“Is Madam Shen coming along too?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Are you trying to break the rumors of disharmony, and prove that you two will stay together?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Is the company going to put more strength in Madam Shen, and give all the resources to her?”</em></p>
<p>While the paparazzi were busy throwing questions, Yu Yaoyao who was kept back inside the car looked annoyed, it was clear that she wanted to step out and speak. However, it was Shen Yichong who stepped forward and completely took over the paparazzi’s eyesight and their microphones. He stood like a flame that attracted moths.</p>
<p>Chen Lin also got out of the car quickly and guarded in front of him, then they were joined by the security guards who had pushed their way over to block the paparazzis from coming closer.</p>
<p>“Everybody please don’t remain calm, we’ve prepared Guangxin’s reception room on the first floor, and we have time for everybody to get an interview! Please don’t push!” The security guards told the press.</p>
<p>“Everyone will be able to ask questions, now please follow the security into the building!”</p>
<p>But not many people listened to them. They took a few steps back, and allowed the company to take a few steps forward before they started taking shots crazily at Yu Yaoyao who by now managed to get off the car right after Shen Yichong!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was wearing a wool dress, and her shoulders were covered by a small knitted home jacket. The same material was also draped around Shen Yichong’s suit. He was probably wearing it because of the cold and not because it was fashionable.</p>
<p>It was clear that the couple came out here directly from their home. Yu Yaoyao wasn’t wearing any makeup, even her hair was randomly tied and was falling haphazardly down to her waist. But when she stood next to Shen Yichong, held his hands, and walked into the entrance with her head held high, almost all the paparazzi surrounding then had only one thought…</p>
