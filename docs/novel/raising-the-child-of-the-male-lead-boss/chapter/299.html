            <p><strong>Chapter 464</strong></p>
<p>The takeaway show finally ended without a hitch. The advertising sponsors all sent an apology to Director Zhao, claiming that their previous doubts and evaluations were a bit excessive. They also sincerely apologized to the program team and Yu Yaoyao. The crisis of the program group was solved efficiently.</p>
<p>But after Yu Yaoyao cooked meals for ten people and fed Little Sweetheart several times, despite being tired, she was still faintly excited. Especially when she saw the compliments of her cooking on the Internet. She felt an unprecedented joy in her heart!</p>
<p>It had seen so long since she last interacted with everyone. In this period of time, she didn’t feel needed, nor did she receive praise from everyone. Every time after a movie was filmed, there was a waiting time for editing, arranging, and broadcasting. Thus, feedback from everyone was delayed. Doing a live broadcast was different. She felt the pleasure and satisfaction of receiving feedback on the spot.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was ecstatic. “Thank you all.” At the end of the show, she bowed to the camera.</p>
<p>“The food I’m eating lately have all been less salty and less greasy. My taste has become simpler than before… But being able to watch you eat and reading everyone’s comments, I feel like I was eating delicious food again,” she began sentimentally. “I’m very satisfied. It’s perfect. Thank you Director Zhao for giving me this opportunity. I also thank my husband and my son for their support. Lastly, thank you, Xiao Yunyun for the ideas and all the planning.”</p>
<p>The fans all typed on their keyboards more frantically as she expressed her gratitude, <em>‘Sis, I’ll eat them for you! ‘, ‘Yaoyao, I’m going to register a live broadcast account now and show you how I eat’…</em></p>
<p>When Director Zhao looked at the live broadcast room, he felt that he had found a treasure when he saw the number of viewers and rewards were still increasing when the show was clearly about to end. The wisest thing that he did in his life was probably taking on the job of ‘In the limelight’ and getting to know Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Little Bun was pursing his lips and pulling Shen Yichong’s sleeve. He was feeling very depressed. “Mommy is so pitiful,” he said. “She must miss the taste of pudding.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked down at his son, and then at his wife. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He hired the most professional confinement staff and a professional confinement cook, so as to ensure the taste and nutrition were all guaranteed. In the end, his wife preferred heavy food and some pudding.</p>
<p>“Can you give mommy one when my little sister is a little older?” the little bun pleaded. “It wouldn’t matter if she just had a little bit, right?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned deeply, lost in thought.</p>
<p>On the same day, a lot of eating show accounts were added on the live broadcast platform.</p>
<p><em>#Watch me eat, Sister Yao</em></p>
<p><em>#I eat snacks for Sister Yao</em></p>
<p><em>#I eat what Sister Yao feels like eating</em></p>
<p><em>#I eat all the junk food for Sister Yao</em></p>
<p>Although the names of the rooms were strange, they were unexpectedly neat.</p>
<p>Even the platform that aired ‘Welcome to My Home’ was happy. The operators were able to find and sign contracts with a few fans that they thought had the potential for an eating show.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After ‘Itch of the Year’ won the award, it was also released in overseas markets one after another. It even won a lot of praise throughout Asia.</p>
<p>It seemed that the career and family problems faced by modern women were not unique to China. In particular, many housewives in Japan and South Korea were facing even more serious problems. This film also helped some housewives who were hesitant and vulnerable towards certain extent.</p>
<p>After the film was released overseas, Yu Yaoyao also found that she had miraculously gained some foreign fans. Unfortunately, her foreign language skills were extremely bad. It was already not easy for her to understand and speak her current language.</p>
<p>“This wouldn’t do. How can I not understand the compliments from my foreign fans? This is such a shame,” she complained.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao thought this was a very troublesome issue. She wanted to read the praised from ehr foreign fans.</p>
<p>“Darling, I think I need to learn English,” she announced.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, Yu Yaoyao decided to learn a language that was used more widely. Although she also had Japanese and South Korean fans, they were the minorities among her fan population, and those weren’t the languages that were used as much. On top of that, her assistant used to major in Japanese language, and she could be a translator for her.</p>
<p>But the main reason why she wanted to learn English was because she heard that Shen Yichong spoke good English, and even Little Bun had recently attended an online English class.</p>
<p>The hardworking Yaoyao resurfaced. “In the future, can you teach me something every night before we go to bed?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked up at her from the pile of files and documents. He did some recall and remembered that his wife seemed to have poor grades when she was a child. It was on rare occasions that she wanted to study. Doing that would also keep her from having nothing to do and overthinking, which was also worth encouraging.</p>
<p>“Okay,” he agreed easily.</p>
<p>Then Yaoyao clung to him. “Darling, how do you say in English, ‘I’m so pretty. What do I do with my beauty?’”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
