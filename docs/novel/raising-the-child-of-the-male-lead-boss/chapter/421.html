            <p><strong>Chapter 342 – The Male Lead’s Regret (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>By now his small face was bright pink as he fumed with anger. Dad told him that Mommy was the only girl in their family. He was to listen to her and always be humble. It was also his job to never anger her, and to make sure she never got hurt in any way. Shen Rui immediately turned into a knight in shining armor, protecting the damsel in distress.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao looked awkwardly at the little boy in front of him. He shook himself out of his reverie when he realized he had acted rashly in front of so many people. “Um… that… Sorry, I lost my sense for a moment there. Child, I found out that your mother looked a lot like a friend of mine from when I was younger, and wanted to make sure whether it was her,” Chen Jiao said as he hurriedly stepped back and distanced himself from Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>As he was explaining himself, he found himself locking eyes with Yu Yaoyao. The deeper he looked into her eyes, the more he felt that she looked like the little girl he had met when he was a child.</p>
<p>Even though the little bun had received an apology, he refused to relent. Taking hold of Yu Yaoyao’s hand, he puffed up his tiny chest and stood in front of her, protecting her from Chen Jiao. “My father said that except in kindergarten and elementary school, boys and girls should stand at least 1 meter apart. As a boy, you can’t touch Mommy’s hands or approach her,” he proudly repeated his father’s words. It seemed that as well as paying a visit to Yu Yaoyao’s work, he was also tasked with being a small valet, protecting her and exposing wrong doings in his father’s stead.</p>
<p>When Chen Jiao heard this, his face morphed into something even more awkward. He hurriedly took a few more steps back.</p>
<p>“Big brother, you say that I look like a childhood friend of yours?” Yu Yaoyao said once she had recovered from Chen Jiao’s assault. She finally noted just how strange Chen Jiao’s words were.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s heartbeat quickened in anticipation.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao shook her head decisively, “I’m afraid you’ve got the wrong person. By having seen me before, don’t you mean that time we filmed together for Director Li’s movie five years ago?” as she spoke, she had a look of deep contemplation on her face, “And before that, though we hadn’t officially met, I may have seen you on TV.”</p>
<p>With that single sentence, all of Chen Jiao’s hopes were crushed. His handsome face subconsciously fell in disappointment and his mouth twisted into an uncomfortable smile. “Then it seems I’ve recognized the wrong person,” he said humbly, “I thought… I apologize, my mind went haywire,” Chen Jiao hurriedly shook his head. It wasn’t Yu Yaoyao, it was Lin Shuang all along. After all these years, he hadn’t recognized the wrong person.</p>
<p>Without quite knowing why, his heart squeezed painfully, and a sense of disappointment dragged his spirits down. It felt as though something had been dug out of his chest, and he felt empty inside. “Then before… you, towards me…” Chen Jiao smiled bitterly and lowered his voice, so that his words were contained between the two of them, “Was your appreciation only that of a fan towards their idol?”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie, that woman, had she been toying with him like a monkey since the very beginning?</p>
<p>“Huh? Like a fan? Nah,” Yu Yaoyao said with a shake of her head as her gentle face turned fierce, “The only one I’m a fan of is my husband. He is the only one I’d kiss and star-chase. Stop with your nonsense! Is this another attempt to discredit me and push me back into the hot search?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s handsome face twitched in discomfort. Then the next thing he knew, a round head butted him in the stomach with the courage and ferocity of a tiger.</p>
<p>“Uncle, the only star Mommy likes to chase is my dad! Don’t break them apart with your words!” Shen Rui refused to allow a bad person to meddle and break his parents’ relationship again. He could still accept it if his dad hugged his mommy, but for other men to do the same was unacceptable!</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s bitter smile grew more anguished, and he shuffled further backwards. “I made a mistake, I’m really sorry…” he said with a nod at Yu Yaoyao. He quickly turned around and walked back to his assistant.</p>
<p>But the moment he started walking away, a cry of excitement sounded from the child behind him, “Daddy!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s body stiffened, and he jerked his head back so he could watch the door.</p>
<p>Sure enough, at the entrance to the studio, stood a man he hadn’t seen for many days now. And despite all the time apart, he could still sense the tall, upright man’s dignity and arrogance. Just by standing there, his aura lowered the warmth in the studio by a considerable amount. Even the sounds of gossip from the onlookers immediately quieted at his presence.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was dressed in a straight, well cut suit and had a cold temperament, one that made it hard for strangers to approach him. But upon hearing the little bun’s exclamation, he strode in without hesitation.</p>
<p>As he got closer, he saw how his son was gripping onto Yu Yaoyao’s hand, guarding her like a small tiger. His youthful face was etched with anxiety and nerves, and anticipation for praise in his dark, watery eyes. He looked like a determined little soldier. Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows at the sight. Shifting his gaze, he squinted towards the direction his son held a strict guard and vigilance against.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen… What an unexpected meeting,” Chen Jiao greeted stiffly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong grunted lightly in response, but his sharp eyes pierced the actor’s peach blossom gaze. “Ah Jiao, were you reminiscing about the past with my wife?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s jaw tightened. He gritted his teeth and grinned widely, “It was a misunderstanding. I still have work to do. I will be taking my leave now,” he turned away to block Shen Yichong’s chilly gaze.</p>
<p>But he could still hear that delicate voice behind him, “Husband, are you here to pick me up? I was thinking of you just now, and you magically showed up. Did you get off from work early today?”</p>
<p>“Not because I was worried about you, but because I wanted to drop by to see you,” Shen Yichong’s voice was laced with a warmth never seen before.</p>
<p>“Dad, this uncle thought Mom was his childhood friend, but it turns out he mistook her for the wrong person and apologized,” the little bun’s voice held the promises of a cheeky tattletale who couldn’t wait to spill all the beans.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s steps faltered. He quickly sped up and climbed the spiral staircase to the second floor. He caught a glimpse of the warm family of three holding hands as he made his way up.</p>
<p>There was an inexplicable sting in his eyes.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie… He wanted to investigate further. Spreading all those disharmonious rumors before; what on Earth was her intention?</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>The YY fans were busy that day. They were cursing the staff from ‘Beauty’ magazine who had dared mock their family’s Yaoyao. They wanted to buy copies of the magazine, not to support the company, but to verify his allegations. Then, quite suddenly, the small account from earlier made another post:</p>
<p><em>[Old Iron Art: Three days of goodbye to all scholars. In all due respect, I am ashamed.]</em></p>
<p>The fans who had been fuming earlier had the flames of their rage quenched with this single post.</p>
