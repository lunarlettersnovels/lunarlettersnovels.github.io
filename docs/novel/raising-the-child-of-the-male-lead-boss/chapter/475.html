            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 288 – Crushed By Jealousy (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>The scriptwriter, Kai, perked up at her performance. His eyes lit up. Director Ma looked on, enraptured. There were a lot of lines that were not said, which were in the script, but the essence of the emotion that the character felt was communicated without hindrance.</p>
<p>“I will just find a rich man, then I will have a good life, wouldn’t I?” said Yu Yaoyao as Summer, sounding dejected and sarcastic, mocking the way people thought life would turn out easy. She turned and her eyes were rimmed with tears.</p>
<p>Director Ma was stunned, so was Ling Shuang. She had underestimated Yu Yaoyao. She had read the script a thousand times to prepare for this role. And Yu Yaoyao, with just one under-prepared performance, had swayed everyone in the room. The bright, radiant Yu Yaoyao was so quickly replaced by this despairing and frustrated high school girl!</p>
<p>Ling Shuang felt the heat of embarrassment on her cheeks as she looked at Yu Yaoyao performing the scene. Every line that Yu Yaoyao uttered was like a slap on her. She had graduated with a major in acting, and Yu Yaoyao hadn’t even a professional acting background. So, how was this possible? Ling Shuang was seething in rage and defeat.</p>
<p>“Those are useless,” rang out a low voice, “You deserve better than that, and you know it.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang looked to see Shen Yichong uttering Meng Haoran’s lines while he looked at Yu Yaoyao with warmth and tenderness in his eyes. All his love and gentle comfort was for her. Only for Yu Yaoyao. Ling Shuang felt her heart shatter.</p>
<p>She tried to calm herself down and not cry as the performance ended. Her jealousy made her unable to look at them in the face. Shen Yichong extended his hand towards Yu Yaoyao and they walked back to their seats. Hand in hand.</p>
<p>While Ling Shuang looked on venomously, Director Ma praised Yu Yaoyao. “Ms. Yu,” he said, “Your performance is certainly extraordinary. It indulged me in the story and I wanted to see more. Mr. Shen himself isn’t bad in acting as well.” He chuckled.</p>
<p>“The look in Ms. Yu’s eyes truly showed the essence of Summer. The desolation that she felt,” said Kai, “You demonstrated it exceptionally well. Could I request you to be the lead of my drama?”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang blinked, not believing her ears. She wasn’t sure whether she was hurt because her acting had been unacceptable or jealous that Yu Yaoyao’s acting skills surpassed hers.</p>
<p>“I would have been honored,” replied Yu Yaoyao, “But I really cannot. My manager takes care of my schedule, and it is very full at the moment. I am so sorry. If you have any such opportunities in the future, please feel free to contact my manager. I would be happy to oblige. Thank you so much for your kind words.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang knew why Yu Yaoyao refused the role because she had heard them talking before. Shen Yichong discouraged her from taking this role. She had assumed that it was because he thought she was old for the role, but now she wondered if it was because he wanted her to take greater roles, not a minor role like this in a small production. Ling Shuang’s tears threatened to spill over.</p>
<p>She quickly lowered her head. “Thank you for the performance,” she said, “I won’t waste any more of your time. I will inform the next candidate on my way out.” She turned to leave. She gathered what was left of her broken heart and her dignity and walked out the door of the audition room.</p>
<p>“I hope I wasn’t too harsh,” said Yu Yaoyao as Ling Shuang left.</p>
<p>“Kids these days barely go through any challenges in life,” said Director Ma, “They collapse whenever they encounter one.” He shook his head.</p>
<p>The casting director took out his phone. “Ms. Yu,” he said, “May I add you on WeChat? Or could I perhaps have your manager’s contact details? I would love an opportunity to work with you in the future.”</p>
<p>Even the screenwriter requested for her business card to get into contact next time. It was a pity that he felt they couldn’t work together this time. Yu Yaoyao had no business card with her at the moment, so she added them to her WeChat and also gave them Ni Yi’s ID so they could get in contact with him. Shen Yichong looked at her with pride in his eyes.</p>
<p>The audition lasted the whole afternoon. A perfect candidate was found for the male lead, but the role for the female lead was still empty. The Director and screenwriter looked at each other, both knowing what the other was thinking. They couldn’t find anyone remotely close to portray Summer’s character. After Yu Yaoyao had demonstrated her acting, everyone else seemed bland.</p>
<p>At six o’clock in the evening, Shen Yichong seized the moment and left with Yu Yaoyao from the auditions. “Director Ma, I will leave it to you to do the follow-ups,” he said, “If there is any suitable candidate in view, I will be present to watch the auditions again.”</p>
<p>He took Yu Yaoyao’s hand in his own and walked to the car park. As they walked to the car, she realized that she had forgotten something important in his office. “Darling, are we going back to your office?” she asked.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong opened the car door for her and helped her into the back seat. “Not really,” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said, “Could we swing by your office? I left something there.” She had forgotten about the red wine that she had taken with her to have some romantic time with him.</p>
<p>He took her hand in his. “Let’s go to the hospital first,” he said, “The driver can get your things from the office later.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was surprised. “Why the hospital?” she asked, “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled. “It’s not me,” he said, “It’s you. You said you were feeling nauseous in the afternoon. Did you have your period this month?”</p>
