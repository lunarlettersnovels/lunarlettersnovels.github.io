        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 434</strong></p>
<p>In the next quarter of an hour, he received about 20 or 30 calls, and his notifications told him that he had roughly 70 missed calls! There were also hundreds of text messages sent to his mobile phone. They were either looking for Little Bun, or they were asking if Yaoyao had given birth to her second baby…</p>
<p>Ni Yi was really getting bald!</p>
<p>“Damn it. The person who leaked my number better be hiding well!” he exclaimed. “This is ridiculous! It’s okay if he only gave it to a few relatives, but what the hell is happening here!?”</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but curse. But in the next moment, someone pulled his sleeve. When Ni Yi lowered his head, he saw Little Bun’s dark eyes. They looked pure, beautiful, and innocent.</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s heart suddenly softened. He immediately hugged this little guy who was only as tall as his thigh.</p>
<p>“Xiao Rui, don’t be afraid. Your mommy will be fine, you will see your little sister soon.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao must have scared the little guy just now when she shouted in pain when they were on their way. Now that both his daddy and mommy were not around, he must be terrified although he looked calm.</p>
<p>Ni Yi comforted and patted little Shen Rui on the back. “Don’t worry. By the way, Xiao Rui, are you hungry?”</p>
<p>“I’m not hungry, Uncle Ni.” Little Bun shook his head obediently. But he quickly pointed to his mobile phone. “Did anyone call for me just now? Uncle, I can pick the calls up. Can you give me the phone later?”</p>
<p>“…Huh!?”</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Ni Yi learned the truth from Chen Lin, who was trying very hard to contain his laughter.</p>
<p>Ni Yi cursed. He immediately grabbed Chen Lin and lowered his voice, “Does it make sense that you didn’t even stop him?”</p>
<p>Shen Lin touched his nose and laughed immediately, “What Xiao Rui leaked was not even the phone numbers of our boss and lady boss. The boss told us before entering the delivery room that Xiao Rui might be afraid, and we shall chat with him more often. He could do anything as long as it’s not excessive.”</p>
<p>As he said, the smile on his face grew larger.</p>
<p>“Anyway, it was your work phone number that was shared. It’s not a big deal. Just change the number later.”</p>
<p>“…just change the number!?”</p>
<p>Chen Lin, seriously…he had no principle!</p>
<p>Soon, he couldn’t help sighing. Mr. Shen’s face was paler than Sister Yao just now. HIs face was sweaty and even his hands were trembling in panic. He could tell at a glance that Mr. Shen had completely lost his reasons. Putting himself in the family’s shoes, Little Bun would not be any better than his father at this time. The little guy even can’t go in to look at his mommy yet.</p>
<p>If chatting could divert his attention, it would be a good thing too. After all, he and Shen Lin were two rough guys. How would they understand what the child was thinking?</p>
<p>“Fine.” Ni Yi smiled bitterly. “Xiao Rui, I’ll pass you the phone if there’s any call later.”</p>
<p>As expected, a faint smile appeared on Shen Rui’s face. Hence, Little Bun who was waiting in the hallway kept holding the phone while Yu Yaoyao was giving birth.</p>
<p>“Hello! Yes, I’m a little scared~ Sister, have you ever given birth to a child? Does it hurt? Is it dangerous? Do you know?”</p>
<p>A lucky fan was chatting with Little Bun. But after a few words, he was already exposing his deep concern for Mommy. However, since most of the callers were unmarried and single, they could not provide him with valid information.</p>
<p>“Ah, sister, you are single and just broke up?”</p>
<p>Little Bun felt a little regret that he couldn’t get a more specific experience of giving birth to a baby, but he still didn’t forget to comfort the fan.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, big sister. My mommy kept saying that you don’t have to be afraid when you’re young, since you’ll have more opportunities in the future. As long as you take care of your skin and exercise every day, you’ll have the perfect face and body figure. There are so many men out there, don’t just dwell on one of them.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was dumbfounded after hearing what he said.</p>
<p>Little Bun quickly finished comforting and said goodbye to the person on the call.</p>
<p>Then, he answered the next call skillfully.</p>
<p>“Hello, sister. Are you calling to introduce work for me, or introduce work to my mommy, or you purely wanted to chat with me?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi, “…”</p>
<p>This child was even more proficient than him when he was in the mood!</p>
<p>As a result, most people who called were purely asking for a chat. The topics even got weirder as the conversations go. In the end, Little Bun became a love line master specializing in teaching them how to not be sad and how to become beautiful quickly…</p>
<p>“I saw my mommy applying water on her face after washing it every day.”</p>
<p>“Mask? Well, she doesn’t put that on every day. My mom said that felt slimy and uncomfortable, so she rather sleeps to keep her face beautiful. By the way, don’t look at the phone and the computer for a long time. My mommy’s skin was fair and shiny when my daddy was in charge of keeping her away from her phone. !”</p>
<p>“Hmm, my mummy doesn’t really watch her diet. She doesn’t like to eat rice, but we’ll still have her eat a little bit of that at dinner so she would be healthy.”</p>
<p>“She would do yoga every day after dinner..Yes. She did it too when she was pregnant.”</p>
<p>Little Bun thoroughly revealed the secrets of Yu Yaoyao’s life.</p>
<p>In less than half an hour, he was on the hot search! But before ten minutes passed, there was another call from the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>Sheng Ji, a character played by Yu Yaoyao in ‘Chaos’, won the Best Rookie Award!</p>
<p>This time, instead of calling Yu Yaoyao’s mobile phone, the organizing committee specifically called Yu Yaoyao’s manager, Ni Yi, for fear of accidents. As a result…Little Bun who was occupying Ni Yi’s phone appeared on the scene again.</p>
<p>He even got on a video call with them.</p>
<p>“Hello everyone, I’m here again.”</p>
<p>Everyone in the live broadcast room was laughing. The host at the awards ceremony also couldn’t help but laugh on the spot.</p>
<p>“Hi, Baby Rui! Congratulations to your mommy, she won another award!”</p>
