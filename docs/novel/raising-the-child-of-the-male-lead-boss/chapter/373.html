            <p><strong>Chapter 390</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao pouted as she listened. They had to pay to have the hot search taken down? Not even the King took people’s money like this!</p>
<p>It suddenly felt like someone had ransacked her nest and stolen all her carefully hidden treasure; she just couldn’t understand how any of this worked.</p>
<p>Only humans would be this greedy and sly.</p>
<p>She was quite upset and immediately shared her thoughts with Little Sisi over the phone. “I’m pretty sure it was Gangster Chen’s doing. All this started when we hung up on him. We also met the boss of the other company when we went out for dinner that one night. I could tell by his sly eyebrows and sunken cheeks that he is the type of person to hurt others.”</p>
<p>By the time Yu Yaoyao was finished on the phone, Shen Yichong had already taken down the hot search. All the rumors about the drama that had brought down the rating were dispelled.</p>
<p>The account that had defeated Meng Xinran back then, ‘My wife is doing pretty good recently’, appeared once again! This time, he wrote a conscience analysis after Guangxin’s official PR post.</p>
<p><em>[#My wife is righteous!#</em></p>
<p><em>1. The plot contains positive energy. The character is tough and righteous!</em></p>
<p><em>The drama, ‘Youth With You’, hasn’t been fully broadcasted yet, but the general idea is that Qian Duoduo is admitted to university (trailer of episode 10), thanks to her diligent studying day and night after admitting her mistake. After she graduates from university, she studies hard to be a good chef. She even tackles the issues with the suppliers of waste oil and diseased meat.</em></p>
<p><em>2. There is no intention to have a bad influence on minors. The school in the drama has punished all the students who were in the wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>While there are scenes of skipping school and fighting, the heroine, Qian Duoduo, was punished accordingly for all her wrongdoings. She almost lost her qualifications for the college entrance examination because of this.</em></p>
<p><em>Later, the school agreed to offset these punishments, because of the effort she made to correct herself, her attitude, and her commitment to helping others.</em></p>
<p><em>The core idea of this drama is to be admired: It’s never too late to fix your mistakes.</em></p>
<p><em>I hope there will come a day for everyone when they finally realize their mistakes and correct them, like Qian Duoduo did in this drama.</em></p>
<p><em>3. There are other, more relevant issues to think about on the Internet these days.</em></p>
<p><em>Compared with this online drama that conveys a positive outlook, energy and direction, the anonymous people who hide behind their screen spreading rumors are the ones who are actually evil. They are the ones responsible for steering young girls in the wrong direction.</em></p>
<p><em>In conclusion, my wife is good and has chosen a script full of rightness. The title ‘Youth Without Regrets’ is the wish of the director, screenwriter, and all the actors.</em></p>
<p><em>Even if our youth was difficult, I hope that our next generation and all the children in the future will be able to have a youth without regrets!]</em></p>
<p>The post was quickly spotted by some YY fans who liked and commented.</p>
<p>It was easy to read and understand and carried a clear logic that just made sense. The arguments perfectly captured their thoughts; even better, in fact, than Guangxin’s PR team.</p>
<p>Their Dayaoyao was righteous, a righteous Yao!</p>
<p>The post also reminded them of Yu Yaoyao’s deeds in the past.</p>
<p>For example, she had taken care of the baby snake the crew used as a prop and had even asked if she could take it home and raise it. The crew always praised her for being down to earth. Furthermore, she was worried about her fans being hit by a car while they were blocking her way to the set. There were so many good deeds that the fans simply couldn’t list them all.</p>
<p>All the fans started to share the topic: #My wife is righteous!#</p>
<p>Many of Yu Yaoyao’s friends from the industry also came to support her. From lighting engineers to photographers, and many other smaller roles that showed their support:</p>
<p><em>[She even prayed for a chicken she had to kill during the shooting of this film. She told the chicken not to be scared and promised to do it quickly so it wouldn’t hurt. She was so gentle!]</em></p>
<p><em>[She was reading books even when she was in the crew. When she acted as a candidate for the college entrance examination, she asked me how to solve the problems on the question paper while she was resting.]</em></p>
<p><em>[I accidentally used someone else’s foundation on her, but she was not angry at all. She even bought me milk tea. I have been in so many crews, and she was the only one who ever asked me how much sugar I wanted in my milk tea. And she told me which pudding was the best!]</em></p>
<p>Soon, everyone was sharing little behind-the-scenes stories that had happened.</p>
<p>YY fans and the drama fans were happy and sad at the same time. How could such a kind person be accused of being a bad example to the kids?</p>
<p>This topic quickly found its way onto the hot search.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Wansheng team had collected their manpower and was ready to put their money forward and wage war. But before the battle had even begun, they had lost.</p>
<p>#There were 9044 new accounts backlashing others for no reason!#</p>
<p>#After tracing the same IP, we found a team of 500 backlashers!#</p>
<p>#Whose cake did ‘Youth With Regrets’ move?#</p>
<p>“Sis, that fan of yours has reappeared!” Ni Yi called quickly to tell Yu Yaoyao the good news. “This person really is a loyal fan of yours! He’s so amazing that he took on all your enemies on his own!”</p>
