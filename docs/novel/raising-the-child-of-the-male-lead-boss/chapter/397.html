            <p><strong>Chapter 366</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>“Oops… What a poor choice of words. How could I have said that? Guess I’ll have to read a few more books then…” Yu Yaoyao covered her red lips as she smiled. “I didn’t really like reading in the beginning.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t help but smile. He added onto what Yu Yaoyao was saying. “Then I suppose Actor Chen has to star in the movie, and we will make sure he gets good results.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao really was getting sharper and smarter. She’d just turned Chen Jiao’s desire to build a closer relationship with her down in the savviest way.</p>
<p>News that the two of them were at odds would be widely covered by the media  as soon as they found some evidence. Now that they were openly confronting each other on set, the paparazzi would no doubt be only too happy to report it.</p>
<p>But she’d solved this problem in an easy way.</p>
<p>Of course, Shen Yichong wouldn’t even consider the fact that Yu Yaoyao’s wit was only sharp so she could avoid having to write a self-reflection essay.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao only had two thoughts:</p>
<p>If the famous actor wanted to shoot, it wouldn’t be bad for them either. Given how popular he was, he’d no doubt attract more viewers. Which could help her husband save up some money to employ some other actors.</p>
<p>And, she was of course, was not his sister. She refused to be backhanded with what she’d said a few days ago. If her husband realized that she was the ‘sister’ Chen Jiao was talking about, she would end up pulling out her own hair trying to explain herself in her self-reflection essay.</p>
<p>This freaking gangster!</p>
<p>She might have been in deep trouble if it weren’t for her cleverness just now!</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao finished speaking, she glanced at the staff and Director Zhu Junfei, all of who’d been watching the show. “Let’s get to work early today. Director, brief me about today’s play.”</p>
<p>Director Zhu Junfei breathed a sigh of relief and looked at Yu Yaoyao gratefully. If it weren’t for her, today would have been awkward.</p>
<p>“Sure. Have a seat first, Teacher Yu. Today, we’ll be shooting the scene where you try to escape school over the wall but are caught red-handed by your senior.”</p>
<p>“Senior?” Yu Yaoyao looked at Chen Jiao keenly.</p>
<p>The director wiped his sweaty forehead and said, “Yes, because Brother Chen Jiao joined, we changed the class monitor to senior at the last minute… We’ve also changed two lines accordingly. I have printed them out. You can take a look at them.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao frowned. What a gangster! But she said, “Okay, let’s get to it!”</p>
<p>After she’d changed into a fresh, youthful school uniform, she walked back to stand under the cameras.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao had also changed into a navy-blue suit-style school uniform. In his eyes, there was already a glimmer of appreciation for her girly appearance.</p>
<p>With an ‘action’, Yu Yaoyao slapped her palm twice, put her foot on the wall and bravely started to climb. Her movement was smooth and neat. She didn’t look weak or waver in any way.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao looked like a noble’s son. He looked up and he frowned when he saw her climbing the wall. A trace of pain flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Xiao Shuang. Do you have to act like this? If your mother was still here, she would wish for nothing more than for you to pursue that dream of yours… Just like when you were younger…”</p>
<p>According to the script, the senior was her past brother next door.</p>
<p>He tried to awaken her memories before she sank further into her degenerate state. He wished that she would quit being a gangster and stop disappointing her deceased mother.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao felt that this sounded disgusting. She rolled her eyes and said in a low voice, “In the past? When I was younger, my ass! Eat shit!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s face paled. That was not in the script.</p>
<p>She should be saying that she wanted to be herself because the person who used to care for her was no longer here. Then, he would say, “No. There must be someone else in this world who cares about you.”</p>
<p>But now she wasn’t even giving him a chance to say his line!</p>
<p>When he refused to leave after she’d finished speaking, Yu Yaoyao waved impatiently down at him from the wall. “Don’t act smart. Get the hell away! If you attract people’s attention, I’ll twist your head off your shoulders later!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao stood there in a daze.</p>
<p>Although they were both absorbed in the play, he couldn’t believe that the good girl from the past had become so rude. But he knew it was Yu Yaoyao who had caused his heartache.</p>
<p>She had changed. She was no longer his girl, and she didn’t even want to look at him anymore. She wasn’t even trying to hide her disgust and impatience towards him. It was breaking his heart.</p>
<p>Was it time to let her go?</p>
<p>He’d let her go once, but after so many years, he’d found her again.</p>
<p>This was God giving him a second chance!</p>
<p>How could he let her slip away again!</p>
<p>Chen Jiao put one hand in his pocket, and his gaze became strong and invulnerable, covering up the pain he felt.</p>
<p>The director cried out excitedly, “Ok, Teacher Yu, Teacher Chen. The scene is over. Your expressions were very good.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao cried out happily and climbed down from the wall.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong came over and personally took her down when she was halfway down.</p>
<p>Speakers blared when his eyes collided with Chen Jiao’s as he turned around.</p>
<p>“You will only head towards destruction if you keep being so stubborn. I was able help a person up back then, I could just as easily throw him down again.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t specify who the person was, but Chen Jiao understood.</p>
<p>“I am no longer the same person I was back then; the person who had nothing. See you, Mr. Shen.” Chen Jiao quickly left the crew after filming the clip. He remembered to ask for the screenwriter’s autograph before he left.</p>
<p>But as soon as he walked off set, he threw the autograph into the trash can.</p>
<p>Back at the crew, Yu Yaoyao hugged and kissed her gloomy-faced husband. “Darling, think of how bloody it would have been if the two of you kept on fighting. Ignoring him is the best revenge we can get.”</p>
