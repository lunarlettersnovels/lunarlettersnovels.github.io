<p><strong>Chapter 365</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who had originally planned to stay in the car, frowned and got out with Little Bun held against his chest.</p>
<p>As a family of three that consisted of a handsome man, a beautiful woman, and a cute baby, they quickly attracted the attention of everyone around them.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao had been talking to his assistant, but he turned around when he sensed that someone else had just arrived. His previously bright eyes, that had been glittering under the sun, suddenly dimmed when he saw how affectionately Yu Yaoyao was holding onto Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Teacher Yu, Mr. Shen, you’re here,” Director Zhu Junfei greeted them enthusiastically. Then he turned and waved in Chen Jiao’s direction. “This is Brother Chen Jiao; I think you all know each other. His sister is a big fan of the screenwriter. He begged me to arrange a temporary group role for him, and he wants to get the screenwriter’s autograph for his sister before he heads home later. He really does dote on his sister…” Director Zhu Junfei explained to Yu Yaoyao with a smile. But as he reached the end of his explanation, he suddenly realized the atmosphere was dark and unpleasant.</p>
<p>Usually, when Shen Yichong accompanied his wife to set, he’d simply sit quietly in the corner and watch the filming. He never aired his pride of being an investor, and the people around him didn’t feel pressured to act a certain way because he was present. If someone were to greet him, he was polite and put a warm smile on his seemingly indifferent face. He always tried his best not to make people feel alienated.</p>
<p>But today, Zhu Junfei felt a chill creeping down his neck even before he’d finished speaking. He turned his head and looked over at Shen Yichong. He was shocked to see that his dark eyes were eerily cold.</p>
<p>And Yu Yaoyao, who was always friendly with everyone, no longer had a smile on her beautiful, delicate face.</p>
<p>Zhu Junfei’s heart skipped a beat. He had a feeling that something bad was going to happen. “Um, Brother Chen Jiao is a group performer. He’s only got one or two lines for today.” That oppressive atmosphere only got worse after he said this.</p>
<p>He was doomed!</p>
<p>He’d seen the news that Chen Jiao had left Guangxin. At one time, he’d felt that Chen Jiao’s relationship with Mr. Shen would be broken, and that they would never work together again. But then he’d seen Shen Yichong’s interview with the reporters. He said that he was neither surprised nor angry to see Chen Jiao set up his own company, given his characteristics… It was Chen Jiao who’d taken the initiative to request a chance to do a group performance. He’d wanted to show his face and have a few lines as his way of supporting the screenwriter, as well as the lady boss of his old company.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao also said that he was willing to cameo for free. They wouldn’t need to pay him a penny.</p>
<p>It was no wonder Zhu Junfei thought he was still on good terms with Guangxin after he left. Chen Jiao had even gone so far as to thank his old company. But now it seemed that Shen Yichong and Chen Jiao were at odds.</p>
<p>“The famous actor seems to have a lot of free time of late.” Shen Yichong shifted his sleeping child in his arms and went to stand in front of Chen Jiao, staring coldly down at him.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao didn’t try and avoid his stare, and his dim eyes once again danced with light when he saw Yu Yaoyao. “Even the busy Mr. Shen has time to accompany his wife. Of course, I will make time to do something for my sister.”</p>
<p>His words made Shen Yichong tighten his thin lips. “I trust you know who the main investor in this drama is?”</p>
<p>As an investor, he had the right to veto the director’s selection of the actor.</p>
<p>Director Zhu Junfei started sweating bullets when he heard this. Never had he expected Mr. Shen to object so harshly.</p>
<p>This was just a group performer role. Yesterday when Chen Jiao had contacted him, he’d felt flattered. Especially since he was a new director. Since the role had very few scenes, he hadn’t told the investors beforehand. He’d only given the screenwriter a heads up.</p>
<p>Zhu Junfei stammered for something to say. Surely it would be more merciful to beat himself to death. How was he supposed to fix this awkward situation?</p>
<p>On one side was the main investor. On the other was a famous actor.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao never interrupted once, but she was covering her face in surprise. Her cheeks had even turned a little red.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao had looked at her when he’d said he wanted to help his sister.</p>
<p>She’d told Shen Yichong a few days ago that no one ever called her sister… She’d even made a fuss about it with Little Bun and asked Shen Yichong to write a 400-word self-reflection essay… This was awkward.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was such a wicked man… That single sentence felt like a solid slap on her cheek.</p>
<p>She blushed in embarrassment, and carefully glanced at her husband’s gloomy expression. Then she noticed that more and more people had started gathering around them. As a famous actor, Chen Jiao’s arrival had already caused a bit of a scene, and now the possible conflict between the actor and the investor made the staff even more curious.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s brain quickly got into work. “Darling, since the actor is so free and loves his sister so much, just let him be,” she said as she hurriedly stepped forward and shook Shen Yichong’s arm.</p>
<p>There was a flash of ecstasy in Chen Jiao’s eyes.</p>
<p>“His sister has been so miserable recently. Wasn’t she just on the hot search? She has gained so much weight, and she has been dismissed by several crews. Gosh, I wonder how much she had to pay for breaching her contracts. And I know gaining weight is like falling into hell for a girl.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s words suddenly shattered Chen Jiao’s newly raised joy to pieces. It felt like his eyes were going to bleed as he watched her lean coyly on Shen Yichong’s shoulder, looking cute and weak as she pleaded with him.</p>
<p>“Darling, just forget about it. Since his sister is so miserable, we should let Comrade Chen Jiao act this role. Later on, we could let the director edit the piece for him, so he can bring it back for his sister. I’m sure she’d like to watch it as a break from her crying and grieving. It might help get rid of her depressed mood and get her to stop thinking about doing extreme things,” Yu Yaoyao said as she waved to the screenwriter next to her.</p>
<p>“Xiao Xiang, come here! The actor’s sister wants your signature! Did you give it to him yet? I’ll give you pen and paper. Now, the name is Ling Shuang. Sounds like a name that belongs to a pathetic person, ripe for execution…”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s body started shaking. It felt like she was plunging a knife into his chest over and over again.</p>
