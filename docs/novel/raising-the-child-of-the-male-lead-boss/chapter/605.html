            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 147 – Start of the Family Reality Show (2) </strong></p>
<p>As soon as they entered the house, they saw the exquisite two-storey interior design with a rather fresh blue and white dominant colors.</p>
<p>Fearing this golden opportunity would slip away any second, the cameramen wildly tried to capture everything, including the layout of the entire room.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong led them into the living room “Have you already eaten breakfast?” he then asked.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu was stunned and immediately felt ecstatic.</p>
<p>At first, he was worried that Mr. Shen was not an entertainer and that he would not be fit for a variety show. Yu Yaoyao hadn’t gotten up yet and what they could only do for now was film the entire house as an appetizer.</p>
<p>But he did not expect that Mr. Shen was actually a warm person who even valued cooking at home.</p>
<p>“I haven’t eaten yet!” Zhou Qiu quickly bit on the opportunity, he then closed his eyes and asked something. “Mr. Shen, do you often cook at home? Do you often cook for your wife?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stepped in and gave him a subtle expression. “That’s what the maid does.”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu was left speechless by his response.</p>
<p>“But since we are filming today, I can give the maid a holiday.” Shen Yichong touched his nose, appearing like he was considering it. “If you like I can give your assistants a takeout.”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu still didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>Since only Shen Yichong was still available, they followed him as he went to his study to work.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu took two cameramen with him to take pictures and record Mr. Shen’s daily activities. And as expected, it was as boring as what was imagined… but the public would be able to see that Shen Yichong was very strict when it came to his profession.</p>
<p>Ten minutes into work, and he’d rejected more than a dozen investment plans for different dramas and artists.</p>
<p>And during that time, Zhou Qiu missed the opportunity to see Yu Yaoyao who looked like an ancient monster.</p>
<p>In this extremely boring part of the recording, he became more aware of the CEO’s devotion to his career. It may be that his adherence to his work was too strong that he was only able to hear the back door being pushed open with a squeak until a sweet and soft but sleepy voice drifted inside.</p>
<p>“Husband, where is the housemaid? I’m so hungry~”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu’s eyes brightened at once and motioned the cameramen to turn at the door and film Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>He saw her squatting at the front of the door wearing a pale pink pajama dress paired with rabbit slippers. At this moment she also reached out and rubbed her eyes, her face still displaying her sluggishness and was unaware of the lens in front of her.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu looked at the cameramen in excitement.</p>
<p><em>Yu Yaoyao get up! Go to your husband as soon as possible!</em></p>
<p>And obviously, she forgot that they were filming today, since she was still thinking about the housemaid who was supposed to prepare the food.</p>
<p><em>What does this situation mean? This indicates that at this moment, she is unpretentious and is giving the most realistic daily reaction!</em></p>
<p>She got up, her eyes were still squinted and her cheeks were tender and red, just like a cute little bun when looking for his dad. Shen Yichong who was working behind the desk, hung up the phone. She walked over to him and hugged him from behind and then squatted again. She was merely squatting behind his back.</p>
<p>A moment later, a growling sounded.</p>
<p>“I’m starving… Little bun also wants to eat…” She hung onto him like an octopus and her feet on the ground were almost tiptoeing.</p>
<p>In an instant, Zhou Qiu had already come up with a hundred headlines suitable for this scenario.</p>
<p>Looking back at Shen Yichong, he found that he had already processed the documents. His chilly eyebrows were already looking gentler and his wheat-colored handsome face turned into crimson.</p>
<p>At this moment, even his thin lips squeezed and a trace of arc formed. He pulled out an arm and pressed her shoulder from his back and slightly bent down, as if afraid she would fall.</p>
<p>It was still early in the morning, there were two cameramen inside the study room who recorded them and this posture of the couple would definitely become a hot topic!</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu did not anticipate that Mr. Shen, who was a cold and reserved person, with a net worth of over one hundred million yuan, would spoil his wife silly behind closed doors.</p>
<p>He had always assumed that the two of them were more or less pretending in front of the public.</p>
<p>After all, Yu Yaoyao was publically known as a wayward mistress. Additionally, no one had an insight into the elusive Shen Yichong, who was mostly taciturn. In the view of the people, the two said that it was love. Well, it was easier to assume that one side took a look at the beauty of the other party, while the other was persuaded by the wealth.</p>
<p>But now, Zhou Qiu had seen the natural intimacy between the couple, he instantly felt that there was definitely the element of true love between them! He was thinking about it but suddenly a low voice was heard in the study room.</p>
<p>“Get dressed!” Shen Yichong said with a gloomy face despite the camera rolling.</p>
<p>As soon as he reached out, he touched the soft arms wrapped around him.</p>
<p>Looking over his back, he noticed that her dress was steadily lifting higher up her thighs as she tiptoed to wrap her arms wrapped around him. In an instant, his mouth sank and he took her away from his back, his arms around her shoulders as he took her out of the room.</p>
<p>“Go and put on your new clothes.” He walked to the door and pressed the camera lens that was following them and pushed it to the side.</p>
<p>Then he turned to the other patrons to the room. “Don’t film this,” he spoke two words in an authoritative and cold tone.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu was startled at Mr. Shen’s command and the cameraman whose lens was being pushed to the side was even more frightened.</p>
<p>They all looked at Yu Yaoyao’s pajamas. Quite conservative, nowhere exposed… Wide and thick, the sensitive parts couldn’t be seen at all.</p>
<p><em>This can’t be filmed?</em></p>
