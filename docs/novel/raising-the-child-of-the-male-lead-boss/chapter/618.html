            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 134 – My Gentle Husband</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Family.</strong></em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt a tremor in his chest—it was a word he hadn’t heard for many years.</p>
<p>As a child, he grew up without a mother; she had run away after he was born, and his father was devoted to his business, sparing no quality time for him. He can hardly remember a time in the past that he ate with his family together. When he got married, his wife seldom spoke to him; she even developed postpartum depression and always strayed far away.</p>
<p>The word family is almost unfamiliar in his vocabulary.</p>
<p>But with the birth of his son, he did what his parents lacked–he significantly reduced the frequency of his business trips and returned home on time, every single day. However, his son is still young, and naturally mischievous. He is at an age where he doesn’t know how to understand his pessimistic father.</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed in the dim light of the hotel, vaguely sighting Yu Yaoyao’s delicate side profile and pouting lips.</p>
<p>After he got married, he initially expected to go home and see his wife waiting—the company of his family. But day after day, all that awaited him were closed doors, her evasive and frightened eyes. After a long time of such interactions… he stopped expecting.</p>
<p>But today, the woman’s clear eyes before him seemed to ignite his cold and hard heart, making him feel a roller coaster of emotions as if a warm current blew into his chest and disturbed his usually calm spirit.</p>
<p>His raised hand paused in mid-air. In the end, he dropped it, his strength falling as it gently lands on her smooth thigh in defeat….</p>
<p>“Next time, send me the photos first,” he softly said. “Don’t… show so much.” His lips pressed to a thin line, his handsome face turning pink in the gloom.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao tried her best to twist her body to look up at him, but he held her down determinedly so he could prevent her from seeing his shaken state.</p>
<p>“Go to sleep. I’ll talk to Chen Lin about work.” Shen Yichong’s eyes darkened.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao cried in sympathy, “At this hour?”</p>
<p><em>Indeed, being a diamond man is not an easy feat! Even Shen Yichong it hard!</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong slowly pulled the quilt that she had kicked to the ends of the bed to the scruff of her neck, covering her lithe body wearing pajamas in the process. Only when he saw the back of Yu Yaoyao’s head covered with the cloth, and devoid of any skin showing, did his expression soften a little. He then got out of the bed and left the room, closing the door behind him gently as he did so.</p>
<p>He gave her a chance to leave after two years. If she refrains from doing it… he will make her stay forever. Shen Yichong won’t let her go even if she cries!</p>
<p>He stood outside the door, like an ominous shadow in the living room where not even a single light was on.</p>
<p>When Ni Yi came out to refill his water bottle, he almost peed himself from fear upon seeing the towering shadow. It was a long time before he recognized it was none other than his stoic boss. He was about to speak when Shen Yichong’s domineering and determined look cut through him, scaring him so much to the point he swallowed his saliva.</p>
<p>In the end, he wasn’t able to drink water; he speedily fled back to his room!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>The next day, as promised, Shen Yichong accompanied Yu Yaoyao for the filming of the pudding advertisement. It is to be known that he is famous for not seeing numerous friends for a long time. But throughout the ride, Ni Yi and Chen Lin’s expressions are very subtle.</p>
<p>The group to which this pudding advertisement belongs to can be called the leader of snacks in China. The group’s newly-appointed general manager, who also inherited his father’s company, is now well worth hundreds of millions. This famous figure, a constant entry on the list for the wealthiest businessman, whom Shen Yichong came to visit, is an eccentric man.</p>
<p>Sure enough, they see a chic young man in a pink shirt and heavily waxed hair surrounded by a group of people the moment they arrived at the scene. At their arrival, the handsome man came up to them directly and tried to hook an arm around Shen Yichong’s shoulder with a friendly smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Oh! Eldest brother, you came!” he greeted Shen Yichong enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“As soon as I received the news that you were coming, I made a beeline for the filming location at eight o’clock in the morning. How exciting… it’s rare for you to accompany your wife to my advertisement.”</p>
<p>His arms halfway to their destination, the handsome boy froze upon seeing Shen Yichong’s dark fac, a sight that made the smile on his face ache.</p>
<p>Ni Yi and Chen Lin exchanged sly glances. Sure enough, their boss specially came just to escort his wife. To see his friend was simply used as an <em>excuse. </em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wasn’t aware of this detail, however. As soon as she entered the studio, her eyes were already glued to rows of delicious pudding puddings. If Shen Yichong’s eagle eyes weren’t trailed on her all the time, she would have already lost control and pounced on the desserts.</p>
<p>“Sister-in-law, we finally meet. Elder brother and I grew up playing in the same yard when we were young. We’ve heard of your name for a long time, but elder brother hasn’t even introduced you to us. I am Li Tao, his junior, three years younger than elder brother. You can call me—”</p>
<p>Li Tao immediately adjusted his tie and held out his hand to Yu Yaoyao, a solemn, respectful look on his face. But when he was able to greet Yu Yaoyao, he couldn’t help but look at her more carefully.</p>
<p>It was common knowledge at this point that Shen Yichong’s little wife was an outstanding beauty. When the group’s marketing director personally presented Yu Yaoyao’s video clip and a unique marketing plan to be designed after her at the meeting, he was impressed with her performance in <em>In the Limelight</em>. That and her humorous devotion to pudding.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he didn’t expect she would be more stunning in real life.</p>
<p>Li Tao was approaching his thirties. Through his family background, he had climbed the ladders of success and naturally has seen countless of women. He once thought he had an eye for spotting unique beauties, and that all his girlfriends were extraordinary and gorgeous. But as he looked at Yu Yaoyao, he suddenly feels inadequate.</p>
<p>All of his former girlfriends are slags compared to her beauty!</p>
<p>The woman before him gave an indescribable, distinctive aesthetic. Her small, sculpted face, her fair skin, phoenix eyes together make her appear pure, yet there was still a hint of sexiness oozing from it that can manage to hook people.</p>
<p>In contrast, he felt that his ex-girlfriends couldn’t even stand to be placed near her!</p>
<p>“Litte Tao Tao?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pulled his attention back with her address.</p>
<p><em>Little… Tao Tao? What…?</em></p>
