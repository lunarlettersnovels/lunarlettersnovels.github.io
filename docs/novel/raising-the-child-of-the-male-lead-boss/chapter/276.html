            <p><strong>Chapter 486.1</strong></p>
<p>With expecting fans, Yaoyao’s ‘I Am a Killer’ was finally released.</p>
<p>The premiere will start on the 18th of the month, with the director and the main actors present. On the 24th, the film premiered again. It was the second time Yu Yaoyao was absent for a premiere. Her first was the premiere for ‘Year’.</p>
<p>Although YY fans had already received the news on Weibo, many people still expressed their support. However, some of the rich residents who lived in the city where the premiere was and had free time, still went to the event. When queuing outside and waiting for admission, YY fans could find many other fans who likewise adored Yu Yaoyao as they did.</p>
<p>Just this morning, Yu Yaoyao revealed on Weibo that she would meet everyone tonight on the big screen through a videocall. She also claimed that she was a fashionista who kept up with the trend and wanted to try the popular sunburn makeup!</p>
<p>The fans were very excited, and many of them left a message saying that they would wear the same makeup as their idol. Even those who weren’t good at makeup also chose to wear clothes that were among the colors of the orangey-themed makeup. Therefore, the YY fans who went to the premiere that day seemed to have communicated in advance; they were all wearing orange. Without even needing to talk, they knew the other was a YY fan by their makeup and outfit alone.</p>
<p>“I just want to see Yaoyao’s new work as soon as possible~ I can’t wait until the 24th. There are still six days left!”</p>
<p>“Me too! Not to forget, she was also pregnant with Little Sweetheart during the filming. Just the thought that I could meet both of them at once… it still makes this premiere worth attending.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Since I’ve nothing to do at home, I might as well be among the first group of people to watch this!”</p>
<p>The fans quickly got together and chatted amidst themselves. At the end of the queue, Ye Yun was also looking around. She had never joined the discussion of other YY fans. She was waiting for someone. However, she had become anxious because the person hadn’t shown up. Just as she was about to make a call, she saw a person wearing a black cap, a black mask, and black-rimmed glasses, running towards her.</p>
<p>“Big Head?” Ye Yun didn’t recognize the person until she got close to her.</p>
<p>“Shh, lower your voice,” the girl whispered, adjusting her mask.  After looking around, she pulled down her mask a little bit.</p>
<p>It was none other than Fang Qiuye, who had dark circles under her eyes. After she finished speaking, she yawned and pulled the mask up again.</p>
<p>Ye Yun was speechless, “Is this necessary?” She looked around and lowered her voice. “People would think you were a star.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye nodded heavily, “I can be considered as a star.”</p>
<p>After the live broadcast, most of the YY fans who watched it finally knew the appearance of their president. Hence, she decided to keep a low profile. It would be a little unfortunate if she ran into a reader and was urged to update her novel on the spot.</p>
<p>“You refused my invitation when I called you to come to the premiere. Now, you’re finally willing to leave your house,” Ye Yun said, pleased.  “You have less pressure for your updates lately?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye gritted her teeth. The pressure to update has always been there, and it has never disappeared. It was just that, she was feeling a little overwhelmed recently.</p>
<p>“I just came out to relax. It just happened that the premiere was happening.,” she reasoned.</p>
<p>The truth was: teacher Gong was driving her crazy!!!</p>
<p>Nowadays, it was not the plot and characters that would appear in her mind when she laid on the bed. Instead, it was a series of attributive clauses, adverbial clauses, and various vocabulary that she did not know! She even had nightmares last night.</p>
<p>It wasn’t about her not getting good results for her novel. Instead, she dreamt that Teacher Gong was sitting at her desk for a whip. He was asking her to translate every sentence she just wrote into English. If she failed to do the translation, she would not be allowed to continue writing the novel. If her translation was wrong, she must also correct them until they were correct!</p>
<p>In the end, she only managed to write 500 words after sitting in front of the computer for the whole day. She didn’t even meet the minimum update requirements of the website and was immediately removed from the recommended list by editor Xiaomi. She was also banned from applying to be on the list for next week. Her readers even said they were so disappointed in her.</p>
<p>What an absolute nightmare! She had never had such a nightmare before and ended up crying and screaming in her dream.</p>
<p>“Please, Teacher Gong! Let me go!” she begged, “I’m just a person who wants to write novels!”</p>
<p>Then, when she woke up and found that there were even tears on her face. As a full-time author, it would be a terrible nightmare if she only wrote 500 words a day, removed from the recommended list, and being abandoned by the readers. That event naturally left her traumatized.</p>
<p>Before, words would naturally pop out in her brain when she put her hands on the keyboard; she couldn’t even stop typing. But now, her first reaction was how she could translate the sentence after a word popped out. She would worry if her sentence could be translated into English, and would the readers still feel the charm after the translation. If not, how can she make it better?</p>
<p>The writer was unconsciously being turned into a translator!</p>
<p>She sighed. No words can express how she felt. Fang Qiuye told Ye Yun the whole story while they were queuing. Ye Yun’s expression became a little complicated as she heard the story. She knew that Fang Qiuye was forced to go on a blind date by her family, but she also knew that she never went to the appointment.</p>
<p>“Is he interested in you?” she inquired with a twinkle in her eyes. “He must be very busy as a university teacher, right?”</p>
