            <p><strong>Chapter 425</strong></p>
<p>After the film ended, many film critics were invited by the organizer to give some comments.</p>
<p><em>“This film does not show passionate love, hatred, nor stimulating action clips. It looks just like our ordinary lives, yet every frame has caught my eye. After watching it, I could only think of three words: This is life. In addition, for the happiness that everyone wanted, there had to be times of helplessness and hardships beforehand, which remind me of my mother and wife’s own experiences. I thank the director and screenwriter.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The director made me cry. Every character in it is quite mature, and the acting skills are natural. It made me immersed in this story. I felt my mood going in a roller coaster following the fate of the characters.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The style of the film looks very simple, but from all the layout and color tone, you can see that the team put in a lot of work. It’s very delicate.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The actresses moved me to tears several times, and it made me feel sad as a woman.”</em></p>
<p><em>“This movie raised a very good social issue. It’s worth the reflection of many people.”</em></p>
<p>Many film critics gave good reviews, and there were hardly any bad reviews at the scene.</p>
<p>The box office on the first day was also announced soon. It was 51 million. This achievement was almost amazing for the art film.</p>
<p>Many people called to congratulate Yu Yaoyao. Her second film work once again delivered an excellent result for the box office. Since her comeback, she has hardly made any mistakes. Almost all the works she participated in have been applauded.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was almost overwhelmed by the phone calls and messages she received. All the calls and text messages were congratulations and greetings from her friends. What surprised her even more was that there were many producers who sent her invitations.</p>
<p>“I’m almost due.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stared at the thick stack of scripts and plans that Ni Yi had sent over.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was smiling from ear to ear, “They’re all willing to wait for your comeback after your maternity leave. If you are willing to play, these projects can wait a year or two before starting. They’re just sending us the general scripts.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao opened her mouth wide, “Wait two years just for me?”</p>
<p>“Sis, your value has increased again. There’s rumors in the industry that you are a gold magnet, and all the works you star in are all going to be famous. They also said your life is prosperous.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s fat face was now also ruddy and shiny. “Waiting for a year or two is nothing.”</p>
<p>The performance of the art film this time was good. People in the company were even saying that Mr. Shen had very good ability. Chen Jiao became the best actor when Shen Yichong barely marketed him.</p>
<p>Later when he got married, his wife turned out to be a famous artist who was popular online with amazing acting skills. Her winning pace is just around the corner, and it was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Over the past two days, there were even people on the Internet who said that this couple was like the mascot, money followed wherever they went. Everyone can easily pick up money at the places they passed by.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s pay had also formally squeezed into the first echelon. She wasn’t the best actress, but her worth even exceeded theirs!</p>
<p>“A new wave of new work invitations has come.” Ni Yi found several contracts. “It’s mainly maternity and baby products, and some home furnishing brands.”</p>
<p>All the suppliers saw her value and invitation for her to be their spokesperson were rushing in. Shen Yichong put the document down after casually flipping through. Obviously, he didn’t care much about these invitations. Yu Yaoyao could pick whichever she wanted.</p>
<p>“Take your time reading through this, you can resume working after the confinement.”.</p>
<p>In short, Shen Yichong meant that all work was suspended now.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t have any comments either. She had now slowly felt the physical exertion. Her feet started to be a little swollen, and she would sometimes get cramps at night. Whether she was shooting for new works or endorsements, she insisted on being in her best state.</p>
<p>She chose to continue to recuperate, and even Shen Yichong gave up most of his work. He was spending a lot of time at home with her every day. He would accompany her for regular walks and prepare meticulous meals for her. He was also always there to entertain his wife, carry out prenatal education, and accompany her to maternity check-ups.</p>
<p>Even Little Bun wanted to stay at home 24 hours a day, but he still had to go to kindergarten. Before leaving the house reluctantly, he always had to check the status of his little sister.</p>
<p>Under such quality care and having to entertain guests from time to time, Yu Yaoyao’s life was very comfortable. Apart from being afraid of the maternity check-up and the process of giving birth, she had nothing to worry about. She didn’t even have any psychological burden for the box office results of ‘Year’.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had a big heart. Before going to bed at night, she hugged Shen Yichong’s arms and hummed, “Darling, I am not the heroine, so I am not worried at all. Everyone’s congratulating me just because they want to make me happy…”</p>
<p>Her remarks made Shen Yichong raise his eyebrows without comment.</p>
<p>But he obviously didn’t think this way. Yu Yaoyao’s performance as the second female lead was great. Her character’s growth curve from the beginning to the end of the movie was very clear. He already thought that the script was good when he looked at it at the time, and it stood a high chance of winning an award.</p>
<p>Of course, he didn’t say these. The best thing was that his wife did not have any pressure.</p>
