<p><strong>Chapter 409</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Du Jingya starred as the second female lead in ‘Allure’, and she was an artist from a small entertainment agency before. The resources her agency gave her had never been good. She was always picking up supporting roles.</p>
<p>Not only was she pretty with great acting skills, but she was also hardworking and diligent, making her popular among the audience.</p>
<p>After Wansheng did some market research, they decided that she was the one they wanted. They invited her to be an artist under their company and made her the heroine of ‘Emergency Moment’.</p>
<p>‘Allure’ was to premiere in the summer; just in time to do publicity to increase Du Jingya’s popularity.</p>
<p>Wansheng was already planning ahead.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng of the Investment Department had been frustrated since he’d lost to Shen Yichong. No matter how hard he tried to convince himself otherwise, he still wanted to fight back. But he also knew he shouldn’t make a fuss out of nothing; just like he’d done last time. He had already been taught a painful lesson.</p>
<p>It took their marketing department around two months to gather a new batch of Internet ghostwriters. But this time his plan didn’t include them, nor their marketing account.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng wanted to win the fight fair and square.</p>
<p>He personally felt that Du Jingya was short on Internet popularity and opportunities to showcase herself. If she had someone who was willing to help her, he had no doubt she would become very popular.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng approached the marketing department to discuss a character set that was suitable for her.</p>
<p>During this period, they also saw some rumored news about Yu Yaoyao being treated like a queen in the crew.</p>
<p>This gave the marketing team the idea of how to ​​promote Du Jingya.</p>
<p>“We aren’t building success on her misery. We just happened to be better than her,” Chen Cheng said with a smile.</p>
<p>After reading the draft written up by the marketing department, Chen Cheng was extremely confident in their plan.</p>
<p>Du Jingya’s crying scene in ‘Allure’ was impeccable. Her acting was soft and natural.</p>
<p>Compared to Yu Yaoyao’s crying scene in ‘Stage’, her performance was all-around cleaner. He had no doubt her performance would easily draw the audience into the plot.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng personally watched the video and came to the same conclusion as the writer.</p>
<p>But not only this, Du Jingya’s hard working attitude and affinity with the crew were also better than Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Du Jingya was always first on the scene during the shooting of ‘Allure’, no matter her sequence in the filming. She would either wait silently after putting on her make-up and costume, or she would learn performance skills from her seniors from the side.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yu Yaoyao, who was also said to have a great relationship with her crew, was photographed by reporters where she was acting like she was the queen of the crew. There were also rumors that she treated her manager and assistants like domestic servants. Not to mention there was a leaked photo of her lying on a chair with a blanket, while the director and the screenwriter were both standing and talking to her. One could easily say that she was quite disrespectful and pampered.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, do you think you’ll come back from this?” Chen Cheng smiled. “You have your ways of solving conspiracies. But what about the truth? It seems that I am going to win this time.”</p>
<p>He paid more attention than anyone else to the comments online.</p>
<p>In just one night, this hot search accumulated thousands of comments, and it even became a top search.</p>
<p>Usually, Yu Yaoyao’s fan group would hurry there to protect her, but it seemed that they had no fighting power tonight.</p>
<p>Except for a few of them that asked the editor not to talk nonsense, the comment section seemed to be overwhelmed by those who were accusing Yu Yaoyao and praising Du Jingya.</p>
<p><em>[I was shocked. I thought someone said Yu Yaoyao had many friends in the industry? But it turns out that everyone is just saying good things about her because of her husband?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Impressive. Even the director has to bow his head to talk to her!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Now that I think about it, all the previous directors used to speak for her. It had a feeling about this then, but now it seems that even the directions were afraid of Mr. Shen’s power.]</em></p>
<p><em>[In such a comparison, Du Jingya seems so much better. She has always been low-key, unlike Yu Yaoyao.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Now that the videos have been contrasted like this, I find Yu Yaoyao’s crying scene a little exaggerated, which makes it difficult for me to relate to.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Tsk, has Yu Yaoyao’s image collapsed?]</em></p>
<p>The longer he watched, the happier Chen Cheng became. He could smell victory!</p>
<p>But he didn’t know many YY fans hadn’t logged onto Weibo yet because they were all in the live broadcast room, watching the big boss spoil his wife.</p>
<p>Later, some fans who saw Yaoyao being criticized on Weibo, came to the live broadcast room to report the news to the fan group.</p>
<p>However, Ye Yun, the vice-president of the fan management group, ID “Pan Xiaobaihua”, was on duty today.</p>
<p>After she saw this, she issued a harsh warning in the group, and quickly controlled the fans who wanted to fight back aggressively:</p>
<p><em>[Silence! If our Yaoyao really has a baby in her tummy, she needs to rest well! How can we let such a small matter disturb her? Don’t go to war blindly. Listen to my instructions!</em></p>
<p><em>First team, find Du Jingya’s and our Yaoyao’s shots for the other shows. ‘Stage’ was Yaoyao’s comeback show a year ago, and her acting skills have improved by leaps and bounds since then! Go ahead and make gifs of Du Jingya and Yaoyao’s acting performances, comparing them one year apart!</em></p>
<p><em>Second team, control the comment area. No one’s allowed to mention the news that our Yaoyao may be pregnant. If this was just our guess, and it turns out to be false, it’ll cause her more trouble!</em></p>
<p><em>Team three, you’re responsible for finding the detailed photos of the crew, the interaction between the staff, and the gossip between them. Find out all the clues and details about Du Jingya and our Yaoyao when they were in the crew!</em></p>
<p><em>I’ll go look for ‘my wife is doing pretty good lately’ and ask for his help on writing articles. Please collect all the evidence needed as soon as possible. Team leaders, submit them to me after you have sorted everything out!]</em></p>
<p>Ye Yun herself held a company management position, and she was very familiar with giving level-headed commands. All members of the official fan group trusted and relied on her. They immediately split up.</p>
