            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 224 – Chen Jiao and Yu Xinjie (3)</strong></p>
<p>During the darkest time of his life, Shen Yichong had discovered him. His mother had remarried, and his stepfather was unwilling to bear his living expenses. From the age of 18, he insisted on acquiring his college degree, and worked while studying.</p>
<p>It was no secret that it was Shen Yichong who pulled him out of the abyss, by financing his studies; sponsoring his first drama; introducing him to the show business, and helping him soar in the sky.</p>
<p>Almost all of Chen Jiao’s fans knew it. Many of his old fans had watched him come all the way from the beginning.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, when the director turned him down as the supporting male actor because of his lack of experience, it was Shen Yichong who strongly backed him, by investing in the crew, and helping him keep his role.</p>
<p><em>Who could have known that this drama would earn him a nomination for the best supporting actor that year!</em></p>
<p>Chen Jiao was said to be the youngest best actor and as far as he could see, all his achievements today, were owed to Guangxin and Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The internet was in chaos as he topped the trending list, and there were over millions of comments. The top comments were divided into two factions. His old fans versus the new.</p>
<p><strong>-{Jiao Baby, mommy don’t believe it, come out and clarify everything!}</strong></p>
<p><strong>-{Jiao, why did you abandon Mr. Shen? I want to hear you say why yourself!}</strong></p>
<p><strong>-{This is not betrayal, is it? Say something, what is this, just two sentences?}</strong></p>
<p>His old fans were mostly reasonable and couldn’t believe that he was the young man from back then. However, many of his new fans came out to challenge the old ones.</p>
<p><strong>-{It is Jiao’s freedom to leave. Or does he have to fall together with Guangxin?}</strong></p>
<p><strong>-{Don’t joke! Even if they were good to him, he already paid them back with all the money he made over these years! Isn’t it because of my Jiao’s hard work that Guangxin has this position today? Or is it because of Shen Yichong’s wife? }</strong></p>
<p><strong>-{After all the merits he has won, Qiao has done his best! He just wants to act, but Guangxin’s strength is its diversification. Now it’s involved in entertainment, music and variety shows, and this is obviously different from Qiao’s focus point!}</strong></p>
<p><strong>-{Why can’t Qiao leave? I support Qiao! Those who opposed, can you be sure that you’ll never change your job in your entire life? }</strong></p>
<p><strong>-{Why can’t he leave? What, moral kidnapping! }</strong></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“I’ve already requested a few VIP accounts to say something for us.” Amy stated in the first line of Weibo, “Your pay in these years, the wealth you have brought to Guangxin, and the investments that Shen Yichong put on you, will all be released……everything will be clear very soon, and you don’t owe them anything.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyes flashed, but he didn’t answer, and threw away his phone.</p>
<p>“Leave me alone for these two days.”</p>
<p>Now, he was a full fledged superstar; he did not need to justify himself to anybody.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Guangxin had lost one of their best actors, that too at such a crucial moment, that the loss was a serious concern for them.</p>
<p>As for the netizens, they always thought they were the Savior, and took pity on the weaker side.</p>
<p>He crumpled the tissues on the table into a ball and throwing it away,  walked into his bedroom.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In the  bedroom of the villa in the suburbs, Shen Yichong glared at the phone on the ground coldly.</p>
<p>After quite a while, he went over to pick up the phone and answered, his voice still husky and rough.</p>
<p>“Let him be. Let him do whatever he wants.”</p>
<p>Through the phone, Shen Lin’s anxious voice was heard, “But boss, there are media people who want to interview you …. and shall we also release an official statement?”</p>
<p>This voice was so loud even Yu Yaoyao heard it and protested immediately. “Ignore him.…”</p>
<p>She was on fire right now, how could Shen Yichong just slip away?</p>
<p>To convince him, she circled his neck with her white arms, and pulled down his face that was still on the phone.</p>
<p>“You can’t go, don’t leave, or.…you take me with you.…”</p>
<p>“You’re not allowed to leave on your own.…”</p>
<p>Chen Lin on the other side of the phone had almost reached their house, but Shen Yichong hung up the phone!</p>
<p>After half an hour, Chen Lin, who was bored out of his wits waiting in the car, saw Shen Yichong walk out, dressed in a suit and a glum expression.</p>
<p>But what was that beautiful octopus on his back clinging onto him so tightly?</p>
<p><em>No. It can’t be. It’s the lady boss!</em></p>
