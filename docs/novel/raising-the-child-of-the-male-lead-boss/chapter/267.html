            <p><strong>Chapter 494</strong></p>
<p>A character without a soul will not attract the audience. If the character just played cute and interacted with humans, that couldn’t fill 120 minutes at all.</p>
<p>But what if the cat had a <em>dream</em>? When a stray cat had an impossible dream of defeating the king of cuteness in the zoo – the panda, such a film would suddenly become interesting. But how would the cat realize the dream? What happens then if it becomes adopted? Will it get along with its owner and settle for a calm life instead?</p>
<p>For the first time, Li Bo felt that the script had become interesting! He couldn’t help but look at Yu Yaoyao. His heart was filled with emotion. Was she born with such acuity, or was that brought out by Mr. Shen himself? If she was born with it, that would be scary! Having such acuity, it was no wonder that every script or role she took on can be popular. She had a good eye, and she wasn’t losing to Mr. Shen at all!</p>
<p>Director Li was suddenly excited. “Xiaoyu, did you read my script? What do you think?”</p>
<p>If she was willing to appear in his drama, did that also mean she recognized the value of the story?</p>
<p>“I’ve read it! Ah, androgyny! I couldn’t do it even after a thousand years of cultivation! It’s amazing, Director Li!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>While he understood every word, he couldn’t understand what she meant. Director Li felt a pain in his forehead. Later, he took out his notebook and showed the couple scene pictures he had taken in the past few days. He briefed them the reason why he chose the locations. The couple were both film investors and important heroines. Moreover, they had a very unique vision.</p>
<p>After briefing the scene, discussions about the script began. Important plot conflicts, turning points, the encounter between male and female protagonists, the laughter and bittersweet moments of each body swap – all these points were discussed one by one.</p>
<p>“In general, the requirements for acting skill are very high. Otherwise, it will be easy for the audience to lose focus.”</p>
<p>“It would be awkward if you don’t perform enough for the body swap scene, and it would be too much if you overact.”</p>
<p>“The male and female protagonists must have obvious characteristics, have their own habits and movements. Then during body swap – as long as you perform each other’s differences and your micro-expressions well, you can make people believe that a soul exchange happened.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded while listening. She also took her son’s colored pen to take notes. This was a good habit she acquired from learning English. Note-taking was good for memorization.   However, halfway through taking down notes, she frowned slightly and raised her head.</p>
<p>“Director Li, is the male protagonist a domineering rich man?” she asked.</p>
<p>Li Bo blushed. “Yes, isn’t that theme popular?” he said. “Moreover, this way, there would be a stark difference between the male and female protagonists, and it will be easier to stand out.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao turned to look at Shen Yichong, who was reading the script, and looked at Director Li Bo. “ A cold and reserved personality?”</p>
<p>Li Bo nodded. “Yeah… is there any problem?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stretched out her hand to cover her face. “Director Li, then you need to find an actor with a poker face.”</p>
<p>Li Bo: “…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stretched out his hand and directly pinched Yu Yaoyao’s backside. “Director Li, I will have Chen Lin take you to the garden below to relax. There is a golf course in the back, you can go and see if it is suitable for shooting.”</p>
<p>After talking, Shen Yichong brought Yaoyao inside.</p>
<p>The corners of Li Bo’s mouth twitched. He always felt that this picture of the couple was pretty… loving? Such interaction was even… sweeter than the script for his story.</p>
<p>Director Li Bo reflected on himself and decided to follow the couple around these few days to get good material. After all, for such an old director, he still needed to observe a lot if he wanted to capture the delicate feelings between the male and female protagonists.</p>
<p>So, Director Li decided not to leave. The place where Shen Yichong lived was the real estate he bought before marrying Yu Yaoyao, and it was a private residence. So, they didn’t have to worry about running out of room. Li Bo could stay as long as he wanted.</p>
<p>“Since there are still many details that I want to discuss with you, I’ll have to trouble you for a few days.”</p>
<p>Li Bo felt  brazaned on this rare occasion. He had to sacrifice his life for the sake of art. But he didn’t plan to be a third wheel. Chen Lin and Ni Yi also lived in the same building, and Director Li would spend most of his time with them, especially at night. He would not harass the couple.</p>
<p>In order to obtain enough information, Li Bo, who did not watch variety shows for many years and only focused on filming, watched both of Yu Yaoyao’s variety shows. He also showed a complex smile like an old father. Sometimes, he would also ask some questions when he had meals with Shen Lin and Ni Yi. He wanted to collect the bystanders’ point of view.</p>
<p>“What do you think of how Mr. Shen treat Xiaoyu? It seems that their feelings for each other are deeper than five years ago. Is it my illusion?”</p>
<p>Li Bo himself was a married uncle. He had long felt no love, and now he just treated his wife like a family. Therefore, he was eager to understand the relationship between Yu Yaoyao and Shen Yichong. Their characteristics seemed to represent the hero and heroine of this movie. One was rambunctious and lazy but passionate about life and came from a normal class family; the other was strict about everything around him and himself and came from the upper class. The more Director Li thought about it, the more excited he became.</p>
<p>“Yes, Director Li, do you notice that too?” Ni Yi replied, suddenly becoming energetic.</p>
