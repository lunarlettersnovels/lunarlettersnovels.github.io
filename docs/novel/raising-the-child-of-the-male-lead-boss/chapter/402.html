            <p><strong>Chapter 361</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao opened the car door, it was to see Little Bun was sitting there in the backseat with his arms and legs anxiously stretched out towards her.</p>
<p>“Mommy, Mommy, come to me quickly! I will protect you!” he said seriously. He clung onto her torso tightly, refusing to let her go.</p>
<p>Once the family was settled in the car, Little Bun scooted to sit between Yu Yaoyao and Shen Yichong. He even went so far as to push his father towards the window seat. He stretched out his chubby little finger and drew an invisible line in the air. “Big devil Daddy, don’t you dare lean over. Mommy will get scared.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nibbled his lips, then reached out and patted his little butt. “Sit down and don’t make trouble in the car.” Then he motioned for the driver to drive.</p>
<p>Little Bun sat still, immobilized by Shen Yichong’s firm hand. He pouted the entire time, but refused to surrender. He wriggled like a little caterpillar until he was close enough to Yu Yaoyao to say into her ear, “Mommy, what did Daddy do to you just now? Tell me about it,” as Little Bun spoke, he glanced at his father in disgust, “Let men solve men’s problems. Mommy, don’t be afraid.” He looked as though he were about to start searching for online classes to show to his father again.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao chuckled when she heard what he said. She turned around, hugged her son, and kissed his little cheek. “Thank you, baby! Mommy just met a beautiful young woman. She called your father ‘Big Brother Shen’, and Mommy was asking your father why she called him that.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Little Bun tilted his head, a look of obvious confusion on his face. “Dad has a little sister now? Why did I not know that? I don’t know her.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong touched his nose. “I don’t even know her, this has nothing to do with me.”</p>
<p>Little Bun tilted his head to the other side, looking even more confused. “Daddy, why does a girl you don’t know call you ‘Big Brother’? How can you so easily have just discovered a little sister?” He didn’t know how the confusing and messy world of adults worked. He only knew he couldn’t get any siblings when he looked forward to having one, but his dad had got himself a younger sister by just leaving the house.</p>
<p>He just didn’t understand.</p>
<p>Shen Rui frowned heavily. He turned to Shen Yichong and grabbed his sleeve. “Did grandma give birth to a younger sister for you? When? Just now?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face went passive for a moment. His son really did have a vivid imagination. He hadn’t heard from his mother in ages. She had lost contact with the family years ago. But not only that, it was impossible for her to bear children at her age.</p>
<p>“Nonsense. Shen Rui, don’t jump to conclusions so easily,” he said.</p>
<p>The problem was that the little boy could be very serious, even if he was talking nonsense. If strangers heard him carrying on like this, they were likely to believe him.</p>
<p>“Daddy doesn’t know this girl. She wasn’t thinking right, and she called me the wrong thing. But we will never meet up again. Don’t worry,” Shen Yichong squeezed Yu Yaoyao’s hand as he spoke to reassure her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Shen Rui badly misunderstood the situation. He hadn’t been listening properly and had only heard the last sentence. He took it to mean that his father was going to say goodbye to this girl. He frowned even further. “Daddy, I never call any girl I don’t know in kindergarten, ‘Little Sister’. Daddy, you’re just too careless sometimes. If you didn’t call her ‘Little Sister’, why would she call you ‘Big Brother’? And now that she has called you her brother, you don’t even want to see her anymore. You’re so cold hearted.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows drew together, and he made a grab for his son to give him a smack.</p>
<p>Knowing that his butt was in danger, Little Bun shrunk closer to Yu Yaoyao for safety.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao held him against her, laughing the entire time. “Our baby is right. Darling, no one ever called me ‘Little Sister.”</p>
<p>Little Bun immediately agreed with Yu Yaoyao, “Right! I also don’t have a little sister.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt a headache coming on. He took out his phone as a distraction.</p>
<p>This Ling Shuang… It might just be better for everyone to have her permanently banned.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, she won’t ever show her face near us again,” Shen Yichong said with a note of finality in his voice. He pinched his eyebrows to try and ease his impending headache.</p>
<p>Before Yu Yaoyao said anything, Little Bun had already grabbed Shen Yichong’s hand and moved his little head to read the message he’d just sent. There were only a few words he didn’t understand, but that didn’t affect his comprehension skills.</p>
<p>Lifting his chubby face, he patted Shen Yichong’s arm with a serious expression. “Dad, it’s good that you’re admitting your mistake.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong thought it in his best interests to not reply to what his son had said. If he did, he ran the risk of making his headache even worse.</p>
<p>Little Bun stretched out his tender hand and shook it in front of his face. “So, Daddy, you should write another 500 word reflection essay,” as he spoke, he tugged on Shen Yichong’s arm, making him lean in closer. Then he leaned near his ear and said innocently, “Daddy, I will help you plead for Mommy’s forgiveness once you’ve finished writing it. Mommy will forgive you as soon as I say something nice about you.”</p>
<p>“Plead forgiveness for me?” Shen Yichong was so angry that his mouth was crooked. “Shen Rui, I think you’re getting a little too big for your boots.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was still holding onto Little Bun, but she was now doubled over with mirth. Through her laughter she said, “Darling, I want to read it too… I want to see your reflection essay.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was totally speechless.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>A few days later, Guo Li called Ling Shuang to tell her how much she had made. After they had deducted the assistant fees, carriage fees and the broker’s share for the role filmed, she had made a dozen Yuan that had already been credited to her account.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang almost vomited blood in anger.</p>
<p>She finally saw how Chen Jiao planned to enact his revenge.</p>
<p>How cold-hearted was Chen Jiao? Even if she had been wrong, she’d been with him for so many years already. How was it that he was content to destroy all her efforts and torture her in every possible way in the span of a single night?</p>
<p>Ling Shuang knew she wouldn’t get any benefits if she continued like this.</p>
<p>She became even more furious when she remembered how Shen Yichong had sent her downstairs to peel walnuts. He’d been absolutely indifferent to her suffering; he clearly didn’t care.</p>
<p>“Big Brother Shen, do you know that I like you? I’ve liked you for so many years…”</p>
<p>In those years back when Chen Jiao had discovered her, she’d heard about the great Shen Yichong over and over again. She’d been able to read the chat record between the two of them. Whenever they met, she’d deliberately left the first move up to him so she could listen to their conversations.</p>
