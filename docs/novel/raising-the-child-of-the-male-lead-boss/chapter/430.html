            <p><strong>Chapter 333 – Low IQ Characters (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Chen Jiao had shown her a film about teaching in the mountains in hopes of helping her realize her childhood dream.</p>
<p>“You hate children?” Chen Jiao sounded stunned.</p>
<p>“Brother, you try it. Those kids will drive you crazy in a single day! They’re too noisy and they don’t listen to anything I say,” Ling Shuang scrunched up her brow.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao pursed his lips and finally laughed. He reached out and fixed her hair. “There is a vast difference between dreams and reality, isn’t there? Have patience. You have only experienced it for four days. Try to figure it out, for at least another week. The attitudes, personas and mentalities of other teachers will only become apparent when you immerse yourself in the character.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang knew she couldn’t change his mind, so she nodded. After all, she owed this brother for all the resources she had now. She had clung to Chen Jiao’s leg tightly before Big Brother Shen would even love her.</p>
<p>“Ok,” she walked into the nursery school, watched the car leave, and immediately her expression changed to one of impatience. Chen Jiao had arranged for her to experience this for a month.</p>
<p>She played games with the children every day, watched them nap, eat, and even had to change a child’s pants if they had an accident…</p>
<p>Ling Shuang was very impatient.</p>
<p>After playing a game with the class, she sat in the classroom and scrolled on Weibo. But every time she scrolled, she felt as though there were fire in her eyes. The fans praised the sweet interaction between Yu Yaoyao and Shen Yichong and they had even created the “Wife” group. She followed the topic of Shen Yichong so she could stalk him. Her heart hurt and she wanted to vomit blood.</p>
<p>This couple was a match made in heaven. Shen Yichong was Yaoyao’s fanboy, her personal servant… There were all kinds of theories. Shen Yichong spoiled his wife flamboyantly, from preparing drinks for her and the cast to giving her afternoon tea and snacks… everything made Ling Shuang insanely jealous!</p>
<p>As she scrolled on her phone, she tore the origami paper on the table into strips.</p>
<p>She had to think of a way to let Brother Shen see the true face of Yu Yaoyao, and let the public see that Yu Yaoyao was not worthy of Brother Shen at all.</p>
<p>She opened her contacts and hovered her finger over Yu Xinjie’s contact information.</p>
<p>After thinking on it, she gritted her teeth and typed:</p>
<p><em>Are you free to get tea?</em></p>
<p>Yu Xinjie was where was today because she was stupid! She had been beaten by a good deck of cards and had not used her advantages well at all. If she had listened to her own words, taken her time and not acted impulsively, would she have ended up like this?</p>
<p>If Yu Yaoyao’s advantages fell into Ling Shuang’s hands, they would be invaluable in revealing Yu Yaoyao’s true identity…</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s face was fierce as she thought.</p>
<p>“Teacher Ling, look at my origami heart. I want to give it to you…” a little girl in a soft pink skirt held up her hand with a pink paper heart in it and leaned forwards. When Ling Shaung ignored her, she stretched her hand out further and accidently poked Ling Shaung’s face.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang covered her scraped face and exploded, “What heart! Did you make a mistake? It’s all fake! It’s not real!” She grabbed the paper, threw it on the ground and stomped on it.</p>
<p>The little girl’s smiling face turned white with horror, and she began to cry bitterly.</p>
<p>Her crying brought Ling Shuang back to reality. When she lowered her head, she saw the severely trampled heart laying crumpled on the ground. The girl in front of her was crying, and the other children, who had been playing happily in the class, stopped and stared at her in shock.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang suddenly woke from her trance and anxiously took a step forward, bending over to hug the girl in front of her. “Little Xing, I’m sorry. The teacher didn’t mean to scare you.”</p>
<p>The little girl scrambled back in horror, hit the stool behind her, tripped and fell to the ground. She began to cry even harder.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang panicked and hurriedly stepped forward to help her. Every time she heard the child cry, she felt as if her skull was going to explode. She had no idea how to soothe children.</p>
<p>The little girl screamed, stretched out her hand, and pushed Ling Shuang away. Her cries got louder and louder, and soon she caught the attention of Teacher He, another nursery school teacher in charge of the big class.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Little Ling? Aren’t you making origami? Why did Little Xing run away?” Teacher He asked.</p>
<p>The little girl couldn’t stop crying, but she still managed to yell a few words, “Origami…being bullied…” she stretched out her little finger and pointed at the broken heart on the ground.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang panicked, “Teacher He, Little Xing gave me a heart. I didn’t catch it, and it fell on the ground. I accidentally stepped on it when I stood up. Little Xing, I’m sorry,” she couldn’t let the child tell the truth.</p>
<p>What she had done to the child just now was awful! But she hadn’t mean it. The child had hurt her! Moreover, she had been a little irritated by the news of the love of a couple that was all over the Internet. She’d felt sad and when she’d seen the big pink heart…</p>
<p>The little girl wiped her eyes and was unable to tell the entire story through her sobbing.</p>
<p>Teacher He didn’t mind. She laughed after hearing Ling Shuang’s words, comforted the little girl, and signaled Ling Shuang to continue to work.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>But she never expected that in the next moment, there would be young voices in the classroom yelling:</p>
<p>“Teacher He, Teacher Ling bullied Little Xing!”</p>
<p>“Ms. Ling deliberately threw away Little Xing’s origami! She even scolded her!”</p>
<p>Children’s eyes are sharp, and they say whatever they want.</p>
<p>There were even a few statements that exaggerated the truth:</p>
<p>“Ms. Ling tripped Little Xing! She made her fall!”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s face immediately paled, “I didn’t!”</p>
<p>Teacher He, who was holding the little girl, looked strangely at Ling Shuang. “Ms. Ling, is this true? How could you do this?” there was a tone of condemnation in her voice.</p>
<p>The teachers gossiped behind Ling Shuang’s back, saying she was irresponsible and was always on her cellphone.</p>
<p>“Children are young and are very sensitive. We have to be gentle with them, and we must pay more attention to our words and deeds,” Teacher He’s words made Ling Shuang’s face turn blue!</p>
<p>Normally, this kind of nursery school teacher wouldn’t dare speak to her in such a way. What kind of nonsense was this? She made more for acting for a few days than she did here in a month!</p>
<p>“I didn’t do it, Teacher He. Don’t you…” Ling Shuang wanted to argue.</p>
<p>“Parents send their children to nursery school not so that their children can be bullied. The parents will come later, Teacher Ling, and you will have to explain to them why you made Little Xing cry,” Teacher He wasn’t lenient when it came to Ling Shuang bullying a child.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang was so angry.</p>
<p>That night, when she got home, she threw all the pillows from her bed to the ground.</p>
<p>When Chen Jiao called, she answered the phone crying, “Brother, I won’t go to nursery school tomorrow. I really don’t like children! I can’t be with these wild kids.”</p>
