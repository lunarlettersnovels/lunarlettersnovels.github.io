            <p><strong>Chapter 336 -Another Chance (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>“The nursery school was also required to rectify their mistake and was fined with an administrative penalty. The principal took the blame and resigned, but I heard that she still supported Ling Shuang. When interviewed by reporters, she made mistakes. She said that as the principal, she did not deny Ling Shuang’s request the first time because of professional negligence,” Ni Yi said.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao understood in seconds. She hesitated, “It means that Ling Shuang didn’t know that she needed a nursery school teacher certification to teach, so the mistake is excusable.”</p>
<p>“Well, everyone was angry because of the dereliction of this duty,” Ni Yi spread his hands. “The principal is 50 years old and was about to retire. My guess is that she took the opportunity to get a lot of compensation.”</p>
<p>Naturally, it was Chen Jiao who had compensated her, let her assume the greatest responsibility, and transferred some of the public’s pressure from Ling Shuang onto her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao picked up her thermos, took a sip, and pursed her lips with a smile, “This brother does not have it easy. No wonder he hasn’t started trouble with us recently, he has been too busy firefighting for Ling Shuang. It’s fine. It has nothing to do with us anyway.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang was unlucky. She had no time to fool around with Shen Yichong. She would be happy if Chen Jiao didn’t disturb their affairs.</p>
<p>While Yu Yaoyao and Ni Yi had been talking, they’d arrived at the front of the studio</p>
<p>Ni Yi helped Little Bun get out of the car, then looked back at Yu Yaoyao who was wearing sunglasses. Her face became serious, “Sister, this is the first time you have officially had a photoshoot for the cover of a big magazine. Be very careful.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Yu Yaoyao was fearless, “I shot for a magazine before. Did I not perform well?” She said after some thought.</p>
<p>It was putting it mildly to say she didn’t perform well. The few editorial pictures that had kept her original body looked like the scene from a car crash.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wore a strange expression after thinking about it. She had a good face and a perfect figure. Why couldn’t she take pictures well?</p>
<p>“The photographer said your temperament was too mellow, you were too plain, your expression was not sharp enough, and that you had no ambition. So, the photos you took were beautiful, but the story was lacking, and there was no character,” Ni Yi took out her phone as he spoke. He listed some of Yu Yaoyao’s previous problems from the last photoshoot. “Your posture wasn’t good, your limbs were too loose, and your hands and feet were a bit awkward, like you didn’t know where to put them.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao rolled her eyes. What did it mean to not know where to put your hands?</p>
<p>“Sister, I’ll list all the precautions for you. When you go to get your makeup, you can take a look. We can fix some of the small problems before you shoot,” Ni Yi said a little worriedly.</p>
<p>All capable, popular actors would have some opportunities to shoot for a magazine. But the opportunity wouldn’t add to everyone’s popularity. Many of the actresses on the front cover of magazines not only gained points with the public, but lost many as well. The main reason was that there was no personality in their pictures. Compared to the covers of other celebrities, they were unremarkable and so they were annihilated among the people. Such public perception was devastating for actresses.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had always worked hard. Ni Yi knew that her sister had already qualified for the cover of the magazine. There was no way she could hide it any longer.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Yu Yaoyao said. She didn’t feel too much of a burden, and she walked confidently onto the set.</p>
<p>As soon as she entered, the person in charge of the magazine, Ken, and main photographer for the day, Hu Yiwei, greeted her.</p>
<p>The entire styling team also came and enthusiastically greeted Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Madam Yu, please come inside.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to invite you a long time ago, but you were not available.”</p>
<p>“Do you know what the theme for today is?” Ken asked, “It is the two styles of urban and jungle to reflect the fast pace of the city. People want to escape and eventually return to the embrace of the forest. They want to remind more women to slow their lives down and look carefully at the world,” he explained as she walked inside.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao walked into a grand studio. Except for the outermost dressing room, the entire three-story building was a large space encompassing almost all the different shooting styles.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ve got it,” Yu Yaoyao nodded. She now understood why Ni Yi had said before that this shooting theme merged with her recent movie roles.</p>
<p>Wanting to escape from the city, escape those pressures, the tortures, the negativity…</p>
<p>After he’d greeted her, Photographer Hu Yiwei’s face changed to a complicated expression. Compared to the others, his attitude was far less enthusiastic. “Miss Yu, this is the first scene we will shoot in the urban style,” he showed her the pictures on his tablet as he spoke. “The entire background is dark and decadent. Your expression and posture can be slightly depressed and show some signs of struggle. Don’t smile, but don’t be expressionless.”</p>
<p>He spoke in a businesslike manner, but his tone was not appropriate. The others called her Madam(Mrs.) Yu, he didn’t.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wasn’t offended. She looked at the background of the picture he showed her and nodded, “Okay, I get it.”</p>
<p>When she had finished studying the pictures, the makeup artist took her to do styling and change clothes.</p>
<p>Soon, a user called “Old Iron Art” posted an eye-catching news article on Weibo:</p>
<p><em>“Today we are going to do an editorial photoshoot of a young actress who we shot five years ago. She was just a trainee before and almost ruined the entire layout. Now, she has changed and become a “teacher” among the people. Hopefully, she will not waste the efforts of our group for an entire ten days this time.</em></p>
<p><em>I also hope people know that even if a woman is not beautiful, she can take good pictures. I hope she has woken up!”</em></p>
