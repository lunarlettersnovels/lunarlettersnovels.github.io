            <p><strong>Chapter 378</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>She had rotated between two crews without even taking a break in between. The type of roles she picked up were also vastly different. Most actors would need time to indulge and withdraw into themselves and out of the roles. Not only were they under great pressure when they were with the crew, but they also had a bad sleeping schedule. The actors needed time to rest and relax before picking up their new roles.</p>
<p>“Gosh, I only have so many scenes every day.” Yu Yaoyao moved her face closer. “Darling, with your investment funds, everyone is taking good care of me. I’m sure the director will make sure I don’t overwork myself.”</p>
<p>The corner of Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched for a second.</p>
<p>The crew really did take good care of her. It had taken one and a half months to finish filming a part that would normally take only a month to complete. The early morning and evening scenes were all filmed based on the scenes stipulated in the script. Unless it was necessary, they would usually only shoot during the day.</p>
<p>Among the actors who kept picking up new roles without taking a break, the majority could only sleep for four hours a day at most. But Yu Yaoyao was one of the lucky ones who could enjoy her eight-hour-sleep every night. Of course, her quality sleep schedule ensured that she gave great performances.</p>
<p>Other crews who were short on funds couldn’t rent a venue for a long period of time, and they couldn’t afford to film long with famous actors.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong had money.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was not feeling fatigued by her filming schedule at all.</p>
<p>As Shen Yichong thought, the corners of his mouth rose in a proud smile. “Then what type of shooting do you want to take on?” In this regard, he wanted to give her complete freedom. “I’ve seen a few scripts recently. There’re also some scripts that the company is planning to invest in. I found some of them pretty decent. I’ll send them to you so you can choose.”</p>
<p>After Shen Yichong finished speaking, he paused for a second. He was reminded of the several other investments that had been decided at the meeting the previous day. “There’s one doctor-themed drama that was sent in two days ago. Are you interested in that? It’s about the work and love-life of emergency doctors. The heroine is a newbie. The theme is also not bad. Of the few I’ve seen so far, its script is considered more provocative and professional; that will easily resonate with the audience. Since you’ve never picked up roles like this before, you can give it a try.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was still clinging to his arm, glanced briefly at the plot summary in his mailbox. She shook her head. “Darling, it seems a little gruesome to me because of the surgery scenes. It doesn’t align with my gentle character.”</p>
<p>Deep within her bones… She was a snake… Not only was she afraid of blood, but she was worried that the sight of it might excite her. She could only imagine what would happen if she showed that morbid excitement while looking at hearts and intestines.</p>
<p>She shook her head without even giving it another thought. “No. I don’t want a role as a doctor. And I don’t want to be a breeder either. Everything else is fine.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t force her when he heard this. He read over the plotline again and realized it might indeed be a little too bloody. “Okay, you can take a look at the rest.” He sent her all the scripts that he had screened. “No rush. Take your time.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong thought that she would need at least two days since there were dozens of scripts. But Yu Yaoyao clung to him like an octopus before he could leave for the company. “Darling, this is it. A female killer. This is a cool one.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong paused and raised his eyebrows. He personally appreciated this script. But he was worried that the director was too young, and that some scenes in the script would not pass the review. But the content of the film was very good.</p>
<p>While out on a mission, the female killer fell in love with her target. In the end, she chooses to surrender.</p>
<p>The script had a very positive subject matter. The character was deep and expressive, and the heroine had a dark sense of humor.</p>
<p>He turned his head to look at Yu Yaoyao’s face. Seeing her glittering, beautiful eyes and pinkish cheeks, he couldn’t help but laugh. “This character has a lot of drama in mind. In the early stages, she’s a liar that’s trying to approach her target. Later, she becomes cold and expressionless, until finally, she gives into the soft spot she has for him.”</p>
<p>“No problem at all!” Yu Yaoyao didn’t even need think about it. “I’m very good at that!”</p>
<p>“Okay then. I’ll ask someone to take care of this. You stay at home and rest today.” After Shen Yichong finished speaking, he got ready to leave with Little Bun.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao walked father and son to the door. She waited for them to get in the car and waved until she couldn’t see them anymore. As soon as the car was out of sight, she covered her mouth and snickered.</p>
<p>Turning around, she smiled while counting on her fingers. “The master said my baby would come when my career was successful. The character I pick should consist of five words… ‘I am a female killer.’ Perfect! Then I still need gold in my elements, and I need something sharp… Ah yes! There are always knives and guns in killing!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had no idea how his wife had scanned the scripts so quickly. It made no logical sense to him.  After he dropped Shen Rui at the kindergarten, Shen Li contacted him with urgent news.</p>
<p>“Boss, someone has invested in ‘Emergency Moment’ before us. And Gu Qianqian’s film… Wansheng Group is the main investor.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s frowned. “Wansheng?” But then he smiled.</p>
<p>He had just asked if Yu Yaoyao wanted to pick the role, but as it turned out, she didn’t like it.</p>
<p>It was probably God’s will.</p>
<p>“Have you confirmed the publicity time of ‘Allure’?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve asked. The poster will be released next month, and the trailer will be released the month after that.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squinted. “Okay, Guangxin will be giving up on these two projects then. Just take them as… Funeral gifts I’ve sent.”</p>
<p>Shen Lin, who was sitting in the co-pilot with his notebook, was shocked.</p>
<p>On Friday night, a group of YY fans who had left messages saying that they wouldn’t watch the web drama ‘Youth Without Regret’, had fallen in love with it…</p>
