            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 211 – A Heartwarming Dinner (3)</strong></p>
<p>In the wild, the survival of the fittest was a cruel yet real phenomenon. But no matter what species, the survival of descendants was crucial for the continuation of a race. By that order, among the family, Shen Rui was number one in her heart, and his place could never be shaken.</p>
<p>The pure, black orbs of the little bun soon turned red. He choked. “Mommy, I will grow up quickly and earn money to buy you meat, lots of meat, all the meat you want till you are full, and can stomach no more.” Golden, bean-sized tears were about to drop from his eyes.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hurriedly smiled and gathered him in her arms. “Okay, okay, let’s start eating~ Come on, let’s taste your daddy’s culinary skills!”</p>
<p>The “touching” interaction between the mother and son had left Shen Yichong’s mind in a mess. He watched Yu Yaoyao eat a small bite of the super-salty eggs, and quickly stuff in with 3 bites of rice till her cheeks bulged. He felt a sharp pain in a certain place as though he were stabbed by a sharp knife. Even more than that, he was stunned. Shen Yichong finally raised the hand holding his chopsticks again to glance at the dark cuisine she had whipped up.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The corner of his mouth twitched for a long time before he gathered his voice and enough brain cells to manage out: “Our family is running short on money?” As he spoke, his lips hooked up to somewhat painfully resemble a smile. “Who told you that?”</p>
<p><em>Of course, it was the gossip running rampant on the internet over the past couple of days. </em>As he spoke, he guessed he surmised in realization.</p>
<p>But she didn’t believe that piece of fake news herself even when she went out in the morning. <em>How could he go so bankrupt that he can’t even buy eggs for his wife and son?</em></p>
<p>But as Yu Yaoyao heard him speak, she forcibly swallowed down a mouthful of white rice. <em>As I thought, my husband has been really hit.</em></p>
<p>The halo of the male lead, once she’d entered the book, turned bleak. There was indeed quite a gap between the imposing self in the book and his current position. A tad bit cruel if she may say so herself.</p>
<p>She couldn’t accept the news herself, much less Shen Yichong. It was only after chatting with Xiao Xianrou and Yu Haiquan at the “Chaos” crew this morning that she was forced to face reality. They had also said that the investment was risky, and that the lost wealth may not be regained even after grovelling for another 10 years.</p>
<p><em>Sigh</em>.</p>
<p>“Husband~” Yu Yaoyao felt miserable on the inside, but she tried to smile bright like a sunflower. “Rice is quite delicious, too.”</p>
<p><em>Eat full and forget the grief of bankruptcy … </em>Even if they found it hard to accept, the most important thing now is to live. <em>Eat enough to get by, till they stand back on their feet…</em></p>
<p>“Before, I used to think rice had no taste – But after having it with eggs, today, I realized the grains only taste sweeter and sweeter the more you chew! It’s wonderful news! Soon, I’ll be able to substitute portions of meat with more morsels of rice!” Yu Yaoyao smiled brightly.</p>
<p>With that, she picked up another spoonful of rice and delivered it to Shen Yichong’s mouth as she had done earlier at the kitchen.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s heart went out with a bang (<em>Doki!</em>), and all their unpleasant memories of the past, which had long been gathering dust, collapsed at once in the wake of her smile. He gazed at her deeply, as though he wanted to etch her entire face, every expression, every arc of the eyebrow, and every single tremble of an eyelash into his mind.</p>
<p>In that spur of time, the bright light of the living room seemed to cast a layer of dazzling brilliance on her face. She seemed to emit a brilliance of her own, shining from the inner confines of her heart like a pearl exuding its soft glow from within.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth and gobbled down the food Yu Yaoyao hand-fed. After chewing the soft, fluffy rice for a while, a smile appeared in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Husband, it really is quite tasty, right?”</p>
<p>He picked up his napkin and dabbed at the corner of his mouth, his chest rumbled as he let out a chuckle. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>This particular variety of rice was gifted by his friend. At the foot of his villa, he chose a plot of land and personally tended to the rice himself every day. Calculating the costs, a single bowl of rice was worth thrice the supermarket eggs. In fact, it couldn’t be bought even with money. It’s one of a kind and couldn’t be bought on the market.</p>
<p>When he cleared his throat, about to explain, the doorbell suddenly sounded.</p>
