<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 293 – Adore (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>By the time Yu Yaoyao glanced at Gu Qianqian’s message, it was already the next morning. She barely scrolled Weibo at night. She was already working very hard trying out different positions with Shen Yichong. She never had any time to spare for other things at night.</p>
<p>When she saw the text, Ni Yi called to inform her that the chief designer of ADORE cordially invited her to attend the brand’s spring conference. They had hoped to talk with her for more cooperation in the future.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao already had the guest ticket for the spring conference because Shen Yichong was invited as the president of Guangxin company. The message from Gu Qianqian got buried amidst the many calls and messages.</p>
<p>“Spokesperson?” Yu Yaoyao asked Ni Yi, “Does that mean I will not have to spend so much on my outfits anymore?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked over. He was unable to comprehend where she had developed this ‘saving’ consciousness. He thought about it, frowning. She hadn’t ever asked him to buy her dresses, or jewelries, or any other thing after her ‘comeback’ to acting. She seemed like a different person. He wondered if their hardships had left behind some form of trauma within her, which manifested in her wanting to hoard food and money for some unimaginable emergencies.</p>
<p>Ni Yi informed her that being a spokesperson meant receiving outfits on discounts, even if the brand’s outfit may not be free. She thought for a while and agreed to it. “Okay then,” she said, “Seeing that it’s only for a few hours and I will get to watch a show for free, then why not? Sounds great to me!”</p>
<p>She hung up. Shen Yichong frowned. She avoided his eyes guiltily. Ever since he had asked her if she had read the book on professional acting, she had avoided discussing the topic. Well, she had no excuse now.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stuffed a big spoonful of yogurt in her mouth and hurried to the room to get changed. She resolved to study hard today and prepare before joining the shoot. She had already read a little and realized that she had much to learn. The knowledge would indeed help her with bigger roles. It would be a great deal beneficial if she can learn about camera angles and such.</p>
<p>Halfway through undressing her nightwear, she leaned down and retrieved the three books she had placed under the dressing mirror. “Why are there so many pages to read?” she lamented, “Seven hundred pages! Just dedicated to acting!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had followed her to the room. He had meant to tell her to take advantage of the brand’s interest in her and suggest that she ask Ni Yi to call a personal stylist to help her get ready before she met them. He hadn’t expected her to be half-naked. It was mighty distracting.</p>
<p>She was still leaning down, her shoulders and chest bare. She was standing on the sandalwood-colored furry carpet, having forgotten about getting changed and still leafing through the pages of the book. “Should I read a hundred page today?” she wondered aloud, “no, maybe fifty. Which one should I start with?” She tapped at the books absent-mindedly when she felt a blanket wrap around her.</p>
<p>“Put on some clothes first,” he said in a low, soft voice, “What if somebody saw you like this?”</p>
<p>The door was a little ajar. She reached up and pulled down a part of the blanket, so her face was revealed. “There is no one in the house except you,” said Yu Yaoyao, “Am I distracting you?” She smirked.</p>
<p>She extended her hands and wrapped it around him, blanket and all. “Are you getting excited—.” Before she could finish her sentence, he buried her head in the blanket and carried her to the bathroom. He picked a cloth from the wardrobe and put it in her hands and closed the bathroom door. When she changed her clothes and stepped out into the room, the three books were lying on the bedside table, neatly tagged with different colored sticky tapes.</p>
<p>“I have indicated the important chapters,” he said, “It will help you a lot for the shoot. Read fifty pages each for today.”</p>
<p>“Naww,” she whined, “You must be taking revenge on me.”</p>
<p>“Ten pages more,” he said, trying to sound stern.</p>
<p>“Awww okay,” she said pouting.</p>
