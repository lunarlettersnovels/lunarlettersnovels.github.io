            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 47 – Director Li’s Praise</strong></p>
<p>The small steamed bun can already solve this math problem in his mind, but he was very smart to his mother’s needs and wanted to make his mom happy by doing what she requested. Therefore, he decided to repeat after her.</p>
<p>But then Yu Yaoyao suddenly said, “Ah, mommy can give daddy pocket money by acting in more episodes.”</p>
<p>At this statement, his face turned red with joy.</p>
<p><em>Then, in this way, will mom have the final say in the family in the future?</em></p>
<p>That means he doesn’t have to worry about whether his stingy dad is jealous of him any longer!</p>
<p>“Mommy, you have to cheer up. Ruirui will help you count—one episode is equals to 20,000, another five is 100,000, and then ten episodes is equal to 200,000…!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao happily answered, “My pocket money for the months to come…Oh! I’ll even earn more than your dad!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t feel anger as he listened to them talk about him as their butts were raised to the air. He watched as Yu Yaoyao laughed followed by the steamed bun as they continued through the series of exercises.</p>
<p>In the end, the pair of mother and son collapsed on the mat, one was sweating all over and the other was thirsty.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned and shook his head, he then asked mama Xu to prepare two cups of hot milk.</p>
<p>He went to his study and dialed the number of his assistant, Chen Lin, on the phone.</p>
<p>“That one spot left for <em>‘In The Limelight’—</em>reserve it for Yu Yaoyao<em>.”</em></p>
<p>Chen Lin on the other line: “…”</p>
<p>He could only think, ‘<em>The boss has really changed. He is now finally using his power for personal gain!’</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>For five straight days in a row, Director Li was able to finish filming all the scenes for Yu Yaoyao, adjusting the schedule to her convenience.</p>
<p>Even Meng Xinran, who was the lead actress of the cast, had to arrange her timetable according to Yu Yaoyao’s schedule. Although she was unwilling and her face almost betrayed her inner feelings, she had to obey Director Li’s arrangement.</p>
<p>During this period, Director Li was like a mad alcoholic who drunk until his mind was no more, or rather until the wine cellar is completely exhausted.</p>
<p>Although there weren’t many scenes, he had found himself enjoying filming those few scenes so much.</p>
<p>When it was all over, he looked at Yu Yaoyao, stretching lazily on the comforter without a care in the world, as if he were looking at a treasure.</p>
<p>“Little Yu,” Director Li said, appreciation present on his face, “I can’t hide this anymore. I have been thinking about it for a while now, but I believe this is a good time to announce it; I think you should give it a try.”</p>
<p>He elaborated, “I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of this year’s big ensemble production: ‘<em>Rebirth in the Limelight</em>’, for new and actors who have recently come back in the circle. And in order for the actor to be able to participate they have to be recommended first by various directors and companies…each person can also only recommend one.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was giving water to Yu Yaoyao, who was too tired to sit properly on the comforter and laid like a boneless person. As soon as he heard this, his small eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of it! I’ve heard of it!” He blurted out. He was so excited that the water from the bottle almost sprayed towards Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“The company lets five or six potential actors—small flowers in the internet, to fight for a spot, but I heard that only two can get admission tickets! In each episode of the show, veteran actors or directors will be invited to judge, and if the contestants are able to deliver well, their popularity will soar no doubt!”</p>
<p>Once praised by experienced people in the industry, not only will there be an influx of new endorsements and work opportunities, but one will also stir a massive buss on social media!</p>
<p>Director Li nodded and smiled gently at Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>He offered, “I believe in your current acting skills. If you like, I can use my last recommendation to make you join the program.”</p>
<p>“Will it raise my popularity?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao has been closely monitoring her Weibo these days. But her followers have only stopped at 130,000 ever since she joined this TV show filming.</p>
<p>“Sister, don’t be funny! Of course, it will!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi quickly grabbed her hand and lowered his voice. “Meng Xinran is also participating. Don’t you think it’s a good opportunity?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded. Although this actress is still a little flower in the industry, she already has amassed millions of fans.</p>
<p>If this girl takes part in the program, the buzz around it shouldn’t be too bad.</p>
<p>“All right, as long as more people are able to see me, I’ll go.” Yu Yaoyao couldn’t help but touch her face.</p>
<p>Her beauty has only been seen by a meager hundred thousand people. It was still far from enough.</p>
<p>Director Li, then spoke to Ni Yi about the time and Ni Yi hastily made adjustments to free her itinerary for the program.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, even if it’s raw gold, it will always glow once polished in the future.”</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao smiled and stretched out her slender index finger to shook it towards him. “No, Director Li is wrong.”</p>
<p>“Even if it’s raw gold, it will still shine now. In the future, it will shine even more brightly—at that time, it will be inlaid with diamonds and emit a more dazzling light.”</p>
<p>Director Li was speechless, but it wasn’t long before he became ecstatic, “All right then! I’ll wait for you become a diamond. When that time comes, I’ll ask you to be the leading actress of my next project.”</p>
