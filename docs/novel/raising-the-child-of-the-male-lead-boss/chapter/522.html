            <p><strong>Chapter 241 – Public Trial (2)</strong></p>
<p>After the news about the navy broke out,  the Internet almost slammed Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>The Diamond Family Crocker Group even released a short video of the latest endorsement.</p>
<p>The appearances of Chen Jiao’s elite group attracted the attention of many people. A successful man who would do anything for the woman he loved and even allow her to choose the most perfect diamond, seemed to embody the ideals of countless women about the life they want.</p>
<p>From yesterday to this morning, the fans who had been extremely lost, immediately found an outlet to vent.</p>
<p><strong>[Bigger than that, you are the brightest one!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Have ethics and ability. Be professional enough! Much better than Yu Yaoyao!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[If you leave Guangxin, you can continue to shine!]</strong></p>
<p>Even if there were several experts and veteran actors who are not serious, all of them were excluded from the issue.</p>
<p><strong>[Zheng Huangqiu V: Young people nowadays should have to relearn and be a man first before becoming an actor.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Lao Yao V: Even if the society will be impulsive, artists without artistic virtue will not last long enough in this industry.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Teacher He V: I was blinded for a while, but I couldn’t pretend to be blind for a lifetime.]</strong></p>
<p>As soon as these veteran artists came out, many internet people turned their back on Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Even some of her fans have been torn.</p>
<p><strong>[Why Yu Yaoyao? Why?! You wanted to be a film queen? Why didn’t you tell everybody?!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Did you only rouse the public’s sympathy to help your husband?!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Why won’t you take the commercial seriously?!]</strong></p>
<p>Many people couldn’t just accept this fact. Yu Yaoyao had lost a huge number of fans that in the end Ni Yi couldn’t even count it.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was afraid that she would be hurt tremendously when she would read all the nasty comments on her on Weibo, so he asked their son to take away her phone.</p>
<p>He personally took her and their son and happily went out to eat out in a top French restaurant to help her relax. He even gave her a card. Nothing like this has happened before.</p>
<p>Before going to bed, Shen Yichong gave her another reassurance.</p>
<p>“No matter what the outside world says about you now or in the future, always remember that I have more than enough money to support you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blinked and sniffed with emotion and got teary eyed upon hearing those words from her husband, the love of her life.</p>
<p>“Honey, did you just entrusted me all your money?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong spent a long time thinking, and then nodded hard.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>That night, various online trolls came out and feasted wildly at the news.</p>
<p>On the second day, in the office building of Crocker Diamond Family, Jia Zijie watched with satisfaction the sentiment of the majority of the public’s opinion on Weibo.</p>
<p>He didn’t even glance at the letter he received from Guangxin’s lawyer. Even when Guangxin made announcements on Weibo against them, he laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>“Help me contact Qianqian’s agent and ask her if she has any intention to endorse.”</p>
<p>He immediately assigned his assistant a task.</p>
<p>In this battle, Excellent Diamond won.</p>
<p>Not only did they take advantage of the opportunity to replace Yu Yaoyao, but they also managed to use some of her popularity for their benefit. Because of her fame, they were able to trend three hot searches in one night, expanding its popularity.</p>
<p>The sales figures of several stores in the evening all increased dramatically.</p>
<p>Jia Zijie looked at last night’s report and marveled at the sales growth rate of at least 30%.</p>
<p>He was immediately reassured.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s adventure had left Shen Yichong and his company gravely affected.</p>
<p>At night, he finds it hard to sleep as he was plagued with worries about his wife and all the things that had happened.</p>
<p>But at present, it seemed that although this skinny camel was bigger than a horse, still it wasn’t as influential as Shen’s golden horse on their brand. Doing business was all about sales!</p>
<p>As for celebrities and star companies that were offended, so what? The product was huge, and finally these stars will likely have someone sponsor their advertisements. A group of actors are just selling their faces, thinking that they were really amazing and adored, without realizing that at any moment they can be replaced.</p>
<p>Early that morning, the Guangxin company had a lower limit and all investors were unfortunately not optimistic. If their sales will remain the same then they would only cause the stock prices to go down like a Waterloo.</p>
<p>Jia Zijie picked up the coffee made by his assistant and was about to write a report to be submitted to the director later when he was abruptly interrupted by the vibrating sound from his phone. He answered the call and after listening to the speaker he exclaimed, “What kind of ad?”</p>
<p>He looked down patiently, without really minding what the caller was trying to say to him.</p>
<p>As a result of his nonchalance the words that popped out from his mobile phone shocked him to the point that the coffee in his hand spilled out.</p>
<p><strong>[Come out and die!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You are responsible for slandering my wife! You are afraid that I will kick your head off!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Where’s your IQ? Don’t think I won’t report this to the authorities!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Does anyone care about this black propaganda?]</strong></p>
<p>Jia Zijie suddenly slammed the coffee cup against the table and then overturned it.</p>
<p>Panicked, and with hands that were shaking uncontrollably, he picked up the phone but his grip was unsteady and so it accidentally fell directly to the ground. He picked it up and tried to run through it’s screen and located the comment sections.</p>
<p>He saw the top of the home page, Guangxin official, and his personal name, as well as the director Ji Chang, and the advertising company behind it!</p>
<p><strong>[Guangxin Entertainment: Waited all night, still no apology was made. Then, we will announce the facts and bring forth justice to ourselves. Please be prepared for breach of contract fees and related conversation for this slander.]</strong></p>
<p>Jia Zijie’s heart began to beat frantically, and then sank to the pits of his stomach.</p>
<p>His fingers trembled a little, and he finally clicked on the video.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the video, Yu Yaoyao’s peculiar little face appeared, amidst the director’s harsh and dirty words, Yu Yaoyao walked the stage repeatedly without complaint.</p>
<p>Even the dimmed look in her eyes was also shown in the video.</p>
<p>However, the scene in which the small necklace was turned out of her neckline, her eyes beamed extremely that left everyone mesmerized!</p>
<p>Jia Zijie looked as if he was being hit on his head.</p>
<p>He then fell completely off his seat!</p>
