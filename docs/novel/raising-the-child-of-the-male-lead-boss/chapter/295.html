            <p><strong>Chapter 468</strong></p>
<p>In front of the camera, Mr. Shen soon translated for Yu Yaoyao on the spot.  It was then that Fang Qiuye realized. Yaoyao didn’t know English, and she was completely a new learner.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her heart started beating faster! Originally, she thought that her idol was unreachable, but now…it turned out that they were both people who were bad at their studies. An unexpected coincidence and similarity. Yaoyao’s face seemed confused even when she was just listening to Shen Yichong’s translation. It seemed exactly the same as the expression she had on her face when she couldn’t understand her physics class. She really missed those years when she was still young…</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye felt that her English level was still much higher than Yaoyao’s. She was still a bit happy.</p>
<p>“A quarter!?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was smiling when a voice message from WeChat suddenly popped out. It turned out that Ye Yun sent it in a hurry. She found that Fang Qiuye was silent after her request. Thinking that she might have asked too much, she took the initiative to lower the negotiation conditions.</p>
<p>“Xiao Ye, as long as you can grab a takeaway, I’ll help you with the conversation in English. I only want a quarter of the meal cooked by Yaoyao”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye immediately agreed, “It’s a deal!”</p>
<p>She knew that Sister Yun would still have to rely on her in terms of speed. Just knowing English without speed was useless. While Ye Yun rushed to Fang Qiuye’s house, she planned with Fang Qiuye while listening to the live broadcast.</p>
<p>“You can call first. I’m on my way.”</p>
<p>“If your call managed to go through, we can have a voice call using your tablet. I’ll translate it for you on the line.”</p>
<p>Although Yaoyao was bad in English, there were still Shen Yichong and Shen Rui. Soon, all the viewers in the live broadcast room realized that it wouldn’t be easy to get a takeaway today. Without solid English skills, they could neither have more than one round of dialogue with Little Bun, nor would they be able to teach Yu Yaoyao English. A call that had gone through would just be invalid.</p>
<p>When the audience discovered this cruel fact, there was wailing everywhere. Among them, many were little girls who were still in school, and most of them still haven’t progressed far with their academics. Besides these young students, a large number of them were office workers or <em>housewives. Most of them had almost forgotten every single English word they had learned.</em></p>
<p><em>[I regret it! I secretly played games when my mother asked me to study English! I was wrong! I was so wrong!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I hated memorizing English words the most! I always skipped my English class when I was younger. If I were given another chance, I would be sure to study hard every day!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I didn’t expect that I wouldn’t even have the qualifications to order takeaway when I simply don’t know English! Gosh, my heart hurts!]</em></p>
<p><em>[English teacher, please forgive me! I will never copy homework again!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I am 165cm tall, look sweet, and graduated with a bachelor’s degree. I’m recruiting a boyfriend who majored in English! I’ll treat you to a movie if you helped me get the takeout! This comment serves as evidence!]</em></p>
<p><em>[My daughter has gone to her foreign language tuition. I’ll let her call once she’s back!]</em></p>
<p><em>[@ ZhouCheng, are you watching? I heard that you became an English teacher after graduation? Let’s get back together!]</em></p>
<p>There were all these kinds of messages in the live room. Hot topics about the show were already on Weibo before it was even over. The popularity was even rising rapidly.</p>
<p><em>#Online recruitment of boyfriend/husband who majored in English</em></p>
<p>This episode of the show had become a hit when it had only started for 20 minutes. The director couldn’t help but smile a lot when he saw the data on both the live broadcast and Weibo.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao truly had a brilliant mind. She could make a show popular no matter what she did!</p>
<p>Thinking so… it looked like he must quickly implement the two new variety shows proposed by Guangxin before the other production teams snatch them away.</p>
<p>When Director Zhao was happily planning, Fang Qiuye was also very happy. After many efforts, her call finally got through!</p>
<p>“Hello?” She cautiously greeted.</p>
<p><em>“Hello~”</em></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s heart was shaking! She was talking to her idol!</p>
<p>Her English was good. With Fang Qiuye’s ears stuck close to the phone, she could finally hear Yaoyao’s soft voice. Her soul almost left her body especially when she heard Yaoyao replying to her. She only came back to her senses when Yaoyao asked her to place an order in English.</p>
<p>She quickly used WeChat to connect with Ye Yun. Ye Yun was already at the lobby of her place, and Ye Yun picked up her call almost immediately.</p>
<p>In fact, Ye Yun had already prepared Fang Qiuye beforehand. She translated all the dishes Yaoyao was preparing today. She even checked on Baidu translation to make sure that there was no problem. She sent Fang Qiuye the names of the dishes along with the address through voice message.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye read out the message immediately. She passed this level by luck and proceeded to the next one.</p>
<p>“Dear ‘Gentle Temper’, I recently encountered a problem,” Yu Yaoyao suddenly said. “Please translate for me…”</p>
