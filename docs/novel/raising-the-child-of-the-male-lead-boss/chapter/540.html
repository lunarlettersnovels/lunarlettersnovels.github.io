            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 222 – Chen Jiao and Yu Xinjie (1)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes dewed and glistened like the most luxuriant caramel syrup; it seemed as if their viscosity would tangle up and weigh down chopsticks, and still get tighter and tighter, until it eventually  drowned the chopsticks within it; melting them until they were smooth, pliant and no longer a distinct entity.</p>
<p>And then as she saw Shen Yichong’s abs, wet from the bath he had given baby Rui and his hair that, usually so kempt, were damp and ruffled, hooding his eyes, all coherent thoughts left her mind.</p>
<p>He rolled up his sleeves, exposing his tight, corded arm muscles as he held her calves, his grip resembling the tightness of handcuffs.</p>
<p>His eyes were like those of a ferocious beast and it seemed very likely that she would be his prey. Never had the feeling of being in danger seemed so enticing!</p>
<p>“Baby……”</p>
<p>She could feel that the atmosphere was very different today; more sexually charged than usual.</p>
<p>Transmitted from his fiery palms, heat flooded her head as her heartbeat drummed in her ears, almost deafening her.</p>
<p>This was called being flipped; she knew it now.</p>
<p>She blushed, conflicted between wanting to hide her face to cool it down and wanting to cover his eyes.</p>
<p>She herself didn’t understand what she felt; all she knew was that she would melt into water under his gaze.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, witnessing her shyness and discomfort, thought that she was like the pudding he always waited for, after dinner, all milky and tender, so  sweet and delicious.</p>
<p>She didn’t know where to put her hands, so she held on to the sheets tightly but didn’t close her eyes until Shen Yichong was about to kiss her. That was when she loosened her hold on the sheets and hesitantly put them on his chest.</p>
<p>The two starkly contrasting temperatures of his hard and heated muscles and the icy cold drops of perspiration falling from his forehead onto her soft and tender skin were too much for her to bear as she broke out into a pant.</p>
<p>“Honey, hmm……your breasts are not bigger than mine.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stilled; dumbfounded hearing from her, such a comment for him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re the best.”</p>
<p>Although his voice restrained and husky, his eyes shone brighter than ever.</p>
<p>Hearing his compliment, she smiled, feeling as if joyful fawns ran free inside her heart. It was so satisfying!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong , thinking that her moan of satisfaction could arouse any man in the world, lovingly held her waist, and hugged her soft body.</p>
<p>Her face, having not a trace of chubbiness, looked small in front of the camera but her body felt soft and plump; she was petite, but just then, seemed almost his size as she nestled in his arms, immediately becoming a boneless snake and twisting restlessly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong held her hands, took a deep breath and asked, “Have you made up your mind?”</p>
<p><em>Stay here, and be my real wife</em>.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao couldn’t even figure out what he was talking about, she exhaled her hot breath in his ears, pinched his muscles, and smiled sweetly, covering his teasing lips coquettishly and nonchalantly hummed a yes in response.</p>
<p>Fuelled by her response, Shen Yichong immediately pushed her to the bed, kissing her passionately.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt her head buzz with excitement, almost echoing the creaking of the usually sturdy wooden bed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt something underneath her and after groping for it, discovered, to her surprise, a phone that instantly, began to ring.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong stopped dead in his tracks, in contrast, the sweat droplets continued to make their way down his forehead .</p>
<p>He hesitated for a second, then decided to ignore the sound.</p>
<p>He turned over Yu Yaoyao’s body, who hummed in response and threw the intruding phone on the ground.</p>
<p>But as she did so, she accidentally swiped the phone. Therefore, the moment it fell on the ground, an anxious voice, from the phone, resounded in the room.</p>
<p>“B…Boss, Chen Jiao posted on Weibo! Shall we have a press conference right away?!”</p>
<p>“Mmm!”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>While the moon, shining brightly, lit up the night sky;the bright  lights in the buildings, downtown, lit up the streets.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie having just come out of the shower, was wiping her hair as she picked up her phone and took a look at the latest posts on Weibo.</p>
<p>Her heart clutched, and the next instant, her phone rang.</p>
<p>She could barely hold up the phone once she saw the caller ID.</p>
<p>“Chen Jiao, this is Xiaojie, I……”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie’s voice, usually, was hesitant, with a touch of feminine softness; right now, she squeaked in panic.</p>
<p>There was a deafening silence on the other side of the phone for a minute until a clear and sharp voice was heard.</p>
<p>“Did you leave your brain outside of the country, and didn’t bring it back with you?”</p>

<p><em>Some chapters might have spelled Chen Jiao as Chen Qiao, as well as ‘The Stage’ instead of ‘In the Limelight’ we are going over those and correcting them. We are sorry for the inconvenience. If readers can also point out chapters we missed fixing, we would appreciate it. Thank you very much!</em></p>
