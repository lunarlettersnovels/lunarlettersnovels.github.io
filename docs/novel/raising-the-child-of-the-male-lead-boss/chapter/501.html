            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 262 – A Couple’s Understanding (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Leaning against the self-service counter next to the super-market, Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui finally studied the map that was handed to them at the airport. Little Bun had trouble pronouncing the words of some places, so Yu Yaoyao helped him and they discussed together.</p>
<p>They crossed out the places that didn’t fit the words on the note passed by Shen Yichong. The staff stood around giving them space but were curious to know their progress. The cameraman, Lao Zheng, tried to get a close-up of whatever the mother and son were planning, but Yu Yaoyao blocked the view and refused to show them anything. “What if I get it right and the director tries to move Shen Yichong?” she said.</p>
<p>Shen Rui agreed with his mother. “That’s right!” he said, and warned, “Don’t make mommy angry.” They hid the map from sight whenever the cameraman or the staff tried to get close.</p>
<p>After several minutes, Yu Yaoyao folded the map. “Alright, baby. That’s probably the place your daddy meant,” she said, reaching out for his hands, “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui straightened his shirt and held his mum’s hand. “Yes!” he said excitedly and carried his little bag with the yellow dragon on it. They stepped out of the supermarket with an ice-cream cone each and called for a taxi.</p>
<p>“Well, you do have to reveal the destination to the driver for him to drive you there,” the staff pointed out, “and we have to film you heading there, as well.”</p>
<p>The cab driver looked back at Yu Yaoyao and Shen Rui in the passenger seat in surprise. “You’re… you both are from that show!” he said “What was the name? Ah, yes! <em>My Wife and I.</em>”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pulled her mask off and held Shen Rui close to her. His face turned away from the driver. She didn’t know the place and the people, so she was bound to be suspicious. The driver was too excited to notice. He happily looked at them and towards the camera. “Are you shooting now?” he asked joyfully. “I watched several episodes and I like yours the most!” he continued unabashed, “My wife watched the show first, and then she showed it to me. I was hooked! Your kid is so smart! My daughter is a fan. My whole family loves you!”</p>
<p>It seemed they had found a fan in this unknown land. “Thank you so much for your support,” said Yu Yaoyao gratefully, “Would you like a drink? It’s hot outside.” Yu Yaoyao smiled at him and handed him a bottle of water.</p>
<p>The driver grinned. “Thank you” he said, accepting the bottle of water and holding it as though it was the most precious thing in the world. “I won’t drink this. I will keep it like a treasure,” he added hesitantly, “Could you sign it, if you don’t mind? My daughter will be so happy.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao obliged and signed the bottle. Shen Rui made a small doodle near her autograph. The driver was elated. He wasn’t the only one. The fans watching it live were envious:</p>
<p><strong>【 How I wish I was there too! 】<br>
【 Water given by sister Yu Yaoyao, I wouldn’t drink it either! 】<br>
【 Drink it! Use the bottle to put flowers in it! 】</strong></p>
<p>The driver finally started the car. She flipped the map open and pointed to the destination where she was headed. “Please take us to Binjiang Park, thank you,” said Yu Yaoyao, showing the map to the driver.</p>
<p>Director Zhao, who had been watching the screen, froze. He turned to a smiling Shen Yichong with a withering look. He had said there were four destination that matched the words!</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen,” Director Zhao asked, rubbing the bridge of his nose, “Please be honest. Did you leave any other hint?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong shook his head with a smile. “None,” he said with honesty, “This is a game testing tactic understanding between the couple, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Director Zhao sighed. “Just tell me,” he said exasperated, “All the other three places perfectly matched the words you left her. So why Binjiang Park?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong gave him a generous smile. “Because that is the only place that has a Children’s park and an insect museum,” he said fondly, “my son would love these places.”</p>
