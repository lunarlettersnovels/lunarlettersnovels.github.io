<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 280 – Be My Wife (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>“Not that, either!” said Yu Yaoyao, waving her hands frantically to get Ren Sitong’s attention. Even Shen Yichong seemed unable to stop her. The staff sighed despondently.</p>
<p>Ren Sitong frowned. “If hers wasn’t salty, then why did she only take a bite and covered her mouth right after?”</p>
<p>“That grilled wing had very less meat,” explained Yu Yaoyao, “When she took a huge bite, her teeth clashed with the bone.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong had always wanted to be friends with Yu Yaoyao, but she had always hesitated because of the scandal and gossip surrounding her. She now realized that those were just people trying to make her life hell. She was actually very funny and genuine. After the show ended, she would surely invite Yu Yaoyao for an outing! Meanwhile, Director Zhao was seething and trembling with his cup of tea, while he watched the broadcast on his monitor.</p>
<p>Ren Sitong was pleasantly surprised. “Hm,” she said, “So that’s how it is. Then is it person number two?”</p>
<p>She looked at the middle-aged man and the boy suspiciously. She looked at Yu Yaoyao, then at the staff. She thought the staff twitched nervously as she said it. She looked back at Yu Yaoyao, who was nodding confidently.</p>
<p>“People usually drink water to diffuse the saltiness,” said Yu Yaoyao, “my son knows that too!” She patted Shen Rui’s head, who nodded affirmatively. Shen Yichong looked on helplessly.</p>
<p>“I choose person number two,” declared Ren Sitong.</p>
<p>Everyone had been sure that the person gulping water was just acting. In this kind of show, where you are being filmed, the most natural response sometimes seemed the most staged.</p>
<p>Director Zhao, in the director’s car, sighed regretfully. “Just give her the hint card,” he said into the phone, “Hurry up and let the Qiu family leave. If the other families get comfortable with Yu Yaoyao, she will find more absurd ideas to ruin the show!”</p>
<p>The staff congratulated Ren Sitong and handed her the hint card. She rushed over to Yu Yaoyao and gave her a hug, and a kiss on the cheek. “Thank you so much,” she said, “I will buy you chicken wings as a token of my gratitude.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong and Little Bun looked at the two women with stunned attention. While Ren Sitong bought a feast of chicken wings and had them packed for Yu Yaoyao and her family.</p>
<p>“Thank you</p>
<p>so much for the food,” said Yu Yaoyao, gratefully. “I will help you find your husband. We can do this!”</p>
<p>She ushered Shen Yichong and Little Bun and followed Ren Sitong. She helped her find her husband. Along the way, they met Jing Yu, wife of the famous singer Xiaochuan. They banded together and finished the tasks. In the next two days, the three wives conspired together and won against the hurdle set up by the program team. The two friends she had made bought her loads of snacks in gratitude for her help.</p>
<p>By the end of the show, they had won a one day yacht trip, and a gourmet of seafood meal. The show was finally done; they prepared to head back home with their families. Jing Yu had a different flight, so she came to see Yu Yaoyao and Ren Sitong till the departure gate. They said their goodbyes.</p>
<p>Ren Sitong and Yu Yaoyao were fortunately on the same flight. They insisted on seating next to each other, while Ren Sitong’s husband, Qiu Dafu, and Shen Yichong took the back seat together to give their respective wives some space.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had never had a friend before, so the moment felt exciting and hopeful for her. They talked about the most mundane things. “You should try the dried plums,” Ren Sitong would offer, occasionally, “They are really delicious!”</p>
<p>“If you want to have a healthy baby, you should take care of yourself first,” said Ren Sitong when Yu Yaoyao told her of her wish for another baby. “I know what to do! When we reach, I will introduce you to this very old Chinese doctor. He is very professional. He will give you some medicines.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt like a whole new world had opened for her. She had never had anyone ever in her life that she could talk so openly about anything at all. Ren Sitong praised her on her smartness. She was impressed by her quick thinking.</p>
<p>“Little Yao, you are more competent than my husband,” Ren Sitong said, laughing, “We need to keep in touch okay? I wish I had married you instead.”</p>
<p>“Hahahah,” burst out Yu Yaoyao, “Well, I don’t have a wife, so you can be mine if you want.”</p>
<p>Qiu Dafu and Shen Yichong seated at the back, stared at their wives, unable to understand what the hell was actually happening.</p>
