            <p><strong>Chapter 348</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao remembered how Chen Jiao had cornered her today, as well as the interrogation he had subjected her to. She couldn’t help but shake her head and sigh.</p>
<p>It’s too late, big brother!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was no medicine for regret in this world.</p>
<p>“Darling, um…” Yu Yaoyao said as she shyly cast her gaze to Shen Yichong, “I love you so much.” Then she threw herself on him, and clung to him like an octopus.</p>
<p>When one was alive, they had to be daring enough to hate and love. Every day should be cherished as though it were the last.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong suddenly smiled as though he’d been touched by a spring breeze. He hugged her in satisfaction, and he reached out his hand to touch the back of her head. “Where’s our son?” he said softly.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her face and called Shen Rui, who had gone to play with building blocks in the small room. “Mommy loves her little baby so much. Muah muah,” she said, mimicking kissing noises. The two of them hugged affectionately.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked down at his empty arms, touched his nose helplessly, and reached out to take both mother and son into his embrace.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Since the kindergarten teacher incident, Ling Shuang had been advised by her manager and Chen Jiao not to go out. She was asked to stay home for a little while and prepare for the kindergarten teacher qualification certificate, as well as to study the script for her teacher role.</p>
<p>But after just two days, she was already feeling uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang had been antsy since that morning, and her heart was feeling restless. In the end, she just put her book aside, gave up trying to study, and sent a message to Yu Xinjie, wanting her to tell her a few more of Yu Yaoyao’s bigger scandals.</p>
<p>Although she was in isolation for now, she would have to face Yu Yaoyao someday.</p>
<p>To her, there was simply never enough evidence of Yu Yaoyao’s scandals!</p>
<p><em>[Xiao Jie, why are you not replying to me? Oh right, I heard that your dad has used a lot of your family savings to pay off his debts. You don’t have any pocket money now, do you? I still have a few unused, trendy bags on my side. You said you liked them before. Do you want me to mail them to you?</em></p>
<p><em>You mentioned last time that your sister had plastic surgery? And there was also problems on her academic qualifications?  Do you have any more information? I will avenge you!]</em></p>
<p>Ling Shuang breathed a sigh of relief after typing these messages. At least she had something to do.</p>
<p>Her biggest enemy was Yu Yaoyao. In this life, she could only truly feel at ease when Yu Yaoyao had been knocked down from her pedestal or had disappeared!</p>
<p>After only a short wait, her phone vibrated. But she only got one simple word as a reply:</p>
<p><em>[Hehe.]</em></p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s heart began to race. That single message seemed to be filled with disdain and sarcasm! She wrote back:</p>
<p><em>[Xiao Jie, what’s wrong with you? You can tell me if you are going through tough times. What is the meaning of this message? I really care about you!]</em></p>
<p>She brought her phone right up to her nose and stared at the screen.</p>
<p>This time, there was more of a wait before the next reply came:</p>
<p><em>[It’s okay. I’m just tired. I don’t want to do this anymore.]</em></p>
<p>Ling Shuang bit her lip, got up from the sofa, and walked around the room in a panic.</p>
<p>“Is she frightened by Yu Yaoyao’s tricks? Or is it because her dad has her under such strict supervision? Don’t tell me she told Yu Yaoyao the truth simply because she is frightened?”</p>
<p>Unease settled in the pit of her stomach. Her phone buzzed again as a new message came through. She glanced at it tensely and breathed a sigh of relief when she saw it was from Chen Jiao</p>
<p>He was just telling her to have peace of mind when she prepared for the show, and to try and stay off the hot search this time around. He also told her to be prepared, to get ready to ace the shooting, and not let him down again. At the end of the message, there was even an animated emoticon of a man touching his forehead.</p>
<p>It was as though she had swallowed a pill of reassurance. She gave a triumphant smile.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie would never tell people the truth. She was in a big mess thanks to Yu Yaoyao. Of course she wanted to see Yu Yaoyao suffer! Even if she were frightened now and didn’t want to participate in it anymore, she would still stand by her side to watch the show!</p>
<p>As long as she survived the current crisis, she would be in Shen Yichong’s sights when she finally defeated Yu Yaoyao by winning the best supporting actress award for her role in the literary film.</p>
<p>By then, Shen Yichong would know who the best decision was.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang immediately picked up the textbook that she had just set aside. She needed to stay calm. She had no time to play tricks on Yu Yaoyao now.</p>
<p>Eventually, she’d be able to take Yu Yaoyao down in a single blow!</p>
<p>Back in the men’s bathroom at the studio, Chen Jiao took a deep breath of disgust when he received a heart emoji as a reply.</p>
<p>It felt as though fire could have sprung from his eyes at that second, but he managed to control his temper. He swiped his thumb across the screen and clicked delete. He deleted all chat records under Ling Shuang’s name. If he had to read a single word more, he would be sick.</p>
<p>After that, he sent a voice message and transferred RMB100,000 to Yu Xinjie, who had just told him the whole truth.</p>
<p><em>[Let me know immediately if she ever looks in your direction again.]</em></p>
<p>Chen Jiao slipped his phone into his pocket after sending the message. He looked at his reflection in the mirror, where a pair of exhausted, confused peach colored eyes stared back at him. He only held his own gaze for a second before he looked away.</p>
<p>He lowered his head and washed his hands like crazy under the automatic tap. Over and over again he scrubbed them. It seemed that this was the only way to wash away the wrong things he had done in the past.</p>
<p>Endure!</p>
<p>He must endure it!</p>
<p>He wanted the vicious, despicable, insincere person to taste the cold feeling of deceit and trickery. He wanted her to fall into despair right when her expectations were at their highest.</p>
