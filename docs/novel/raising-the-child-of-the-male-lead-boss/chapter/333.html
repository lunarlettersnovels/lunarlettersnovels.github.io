            <p><strong>Chapter 430</strong></p>
<p>His studio had absorbed nearly a dozen newcomers, but none of them had grown up enough to stand alone.</p>
<p>And the several artists he knew personally, they all rejected his invitation by saying their contract with the company had not expired, and he had to wait.. But he knew clearly that some people were deliberately distancing themselves from him because of Guangxin and Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>He and the other artists in his studio were destined to not get any awards this year.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao took a deep breath and sat in the venue with an usual expression. It was not until half an hour after the award ceremony started that he barely got out of his thoughts. He didn’t care much about the series of opening remarks and live performances.</p>
<p>But soon, his eyelids began to jump frantically.</p>
<p>“The following are the awards for best supporting actor. Actors who are nominated include…”</p>
<p>Although Chen Jiao didn’t have much hope, he still had slight expectations since he came to the scene.</p>
<p>“Chen Jiao from ‘Allure’. He portrayed a character that left us with a deep impression; Luo Zhengyu from ‘Great Xing’an Mountains’, who deduced the tenacity and super willpower as a teenager…”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao squeezed his fist, as he tried to be calm in front of the camera.</p>
<p>“The final winner is…Congratulations to Luo Zhengyu from “Great Xing’an Mountains’! Your performance is very simple and natural, but it stays in the hearts of our audience and which reminds us about your character over and over again.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao frowned. Luo Zhengyu was a rookie from Guangxin! He was also once his junior! At that time, the little boy was very shy and afraid to speak when he greeted Chen Jiao. He even taught Luo Zhengyu acting courses when he was still a trainee.</p>
<p>Before Luo Zhengyu went on the stage to accept the award, he embraced the artists around him. Since Chen Jiao was nominated for the same category, their seats were near.</p>
<p>Luo Zhengyu stretched out his hand to him, “Brother Jiao, thank you for your guidance.”</p>
<p>But Chen Jiao was stuck in memories, and he didn’t react. Even his expression was very stiff. The image was captured by the camera, and it gave people plenty of space for imagination. All of a sudden, the audience understood the expression.</p>
<p><em>[Chen Jiao thought this award belonged to him, right?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Woo..Look at that expression!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Luo Zhengyu belongs to Guangxin, everyone! Haha, this is a slap in the face!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Great Xing’an Mountains is also Guangxin’s investment, right? Hehe…If Chen Jiao didn’t leave, he would have had a chance to win this award with this film. He might even win another leading actor award!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Was being defeated by a rookie the script’s fault? Leading Actor Chen is out!]</em></p>
<p>While everyone was mocking him, Chen Jiao’s fans were feeling angry and wronged. Other than Chen Jiao’s brainless fans and fans who only liked him for his appearance were still supporting him, the other fans were all silent.</p>
<p>They all knew very well what a failure ‘Allure’ was. Chen Jiao almost destroyed a classic character. Or in other words, the script itself caused the performance to go in the wrong direction. The fans had no way to defend him.</p>
<p>When ‘Allure’ was nominated, they didn’t even want to vote for it! How can it compete with the others?!</p>
<p>They were so frustrated but they had nowhere to vent! In the end, Chen Jiao’s fans began to attack and argue with each other on the live broadcast, making fans of other artists and passers-by stunned.</p>
<p>In contrast, YY fans were very organized and disciplined. Ye Yun saw the chaos in the live broadcast room. She immediately went to the YY fan group and made an announcement.</p>
<p><em>[The Best Female Supporting Award is coming soon, no matter who the award goes to, we must congratulate her. Do not have disputes with other fans or Yaoyao’s reputation would be ruined by us.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Okay, no problem!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Roger that!]</em></p>
<p><em>[!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Rest assured!]</em></p>
<p>Everyone in the group replied one after another. Even the president of the fan club who hadn’t appeared for a long time appeared. This was in order to prevent someone from attacking others in the name of Yaoyao’s fans.</p>
<p>When everyone was ready, they quietly guarded the screen and waited for the award. Soon, the two senior filmmakers in charge of awarding the awards were on the stage.</p>
<p>“This time, the competition for the best female supporting role is very fierce, as many talented artists were nominated. Right. There are many beautiful and talented actresses. Let us first take a look at the list of nominees…</p>
<p>“Gu Qianqian from ‘In the Great Mountain’ showed gentleness, tolerance, intellect and dedication of a people’s teacher to the fullest in his performance; Yu Yaoyao from “Itch of the Year” showed us the pain and tolerance of being abandoned by her husband, and the bravery as perseverance as a mother…”</p>
<p>All the YY fans obeyed the instructions of the president and the vice president to stay silent. But they were all nervous.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was not there. The camera only showed an empty seat and Qi Hang, the director of ‘Itch of the Year’. Qi Hang smiled and nodded towards the camera, seemingly calm and confident.</p>
<p>The big screen on the scene quickly flashed short clips of the five nominees. The scene of Yu Yaoyao smoking in the rain was indeed chosen.</p>
<p>The fans were all thumping with excitement. The performance of this scene was very classic. No matter how they looked at it, they thought it was an award-winning work!</p>
<p>“Best Supporting Female Award, let us congratulate——” The award-presenter took a breath. “Congratulations, ‘Itch of the Year’, Yu Yaoyao!”</p>
