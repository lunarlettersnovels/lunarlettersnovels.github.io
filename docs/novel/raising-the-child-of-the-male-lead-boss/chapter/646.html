<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 105 – Not So Chaste</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was on the other side of the phone, snorted softly, “If you can’t buy such a simple thing as a pudding, then what purpose do you serve?”</p>
<p>The man was frightened to the point he almost cried. “Fairy, d-d-d-don’t, don’t-t-t, don’t be angry! I’ll try looking again!”</p>
<p>“I don’t care if you’re able to buy it anymore, look at the time already! Deliver the puddings you purchased at the door and take away your cap!”</p>
<p>“No, no, no, fairy, I don’t want the hat. I’ll put it downstairs for you, and I’ll get the hell out of here!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed and then ended the call, flashing a smile at Meng Xinran.</p>
<p>“Meng Xinran, did you hear everything?”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran gnashed her teeth. Yu Yaoyao has already slept with the other party in such a short period, and now, she was cleverly threatening this person to cover for her in an emergency after they had done the deed in haste.</p>
<p>This fox is very cunning in her colorful ways!</p>
<p>“Elder sister, if you don’t confess, reporters will …”</p>
<p>“Releasing it to the press?” Yu Yaoyao squinted her eyes at Meng Xinran. She stood up, her body radiating her icy mood as she neared her one step at a time. “Or are you going to do something to me?”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran stepped back and turned pale. “Elder sister, what are you even saying; this has nothing to do with me!”</p>
<p>“Oh? How can you say so? How were you even able to recognize the man in this picture?” Yu Yaoyao questioned loudly. “How do you know he is the man who came into my room? Especially with such a blurry scandal photo, how are you able to recognize it’s this man?”</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes changed. Just recently, Meng Xinran herself announced that the caller id portrait was the man hiding in Yu Yaoyao’s room. They had all heard it. However, they were able to think through it more, the infamous photo released only showed the man’s side profile; his entire face should be unrecognizable!</p>
<p>The crowd looked at Meng Xinran’s eyes with eyes full of doubt.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s heart thumped and clenched her fist. “Just from his tattoos, one can already see that he is not a chaste man!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s smile turned even menacing; she looked towards the door and said, “Chief makeup artist, sister, she just said you are a wild person. Oh, eldest brother cameraman, she’s scolding you too.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s little face became white, “That’s not what I meant, elder sister, you’re turning my words around! I said that, that, because a mere delivery guy can’t be on your WeChat! And for him to have the same hat with the man in the photo, it’s impossible to be just a coincidence!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sneered, “I was not satisfied with his delivery, didn’t you hear?”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran trembled all over.<em> Impossible! She drank wine, and then she should have swallowed the drug with it; she should be reacting now!</em></p>
<p>Only when she has finished searching the bedroom will she be relieved! She looked at the bed and with a quick jerk, uncovered the quilt which had rolled into a big ball on the bed. Her eyes suddenly lit up in realization!</p>
<p><em>If they did that, the sheets should have left the scent of their lovemaking!</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran quickly climbed above the bed and shook the quilt open. She then placed the tip of her nose to smell it, her actions shocking people in the vicinity who were able to see it!</p>
<p>Specifically, the deputy director didn’t want to see anymore, “Little Meng, let’s go, the news was just slander.”</p>
<p>But Meng Xinran could not believe it. As if she had not heard it, she checked the sheets again and again and almost buried herself down to Yu Yaoyao’s bed. In the end, the bed was spotless.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran could only gnash her teeth in a fury, <em>How is this even possible!</em></p>
<p>But when she looked up, her eyes landed on the chair where Yu Yaoyao had been sitting. Beneath the chai was a garbage can without a lid, which prompted Meng Xinran another sudden thought!</p>
<p><em>The man should have worn a c*nd0m! Yes, that’s right! Before he left, he must have disposed of the used c*nd0m in this room!</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran looked at Yu Yaoyao’s perfect face, thinking that she would be able to tear her apart in the next second. She couldn’t help but laugh excitedly. “Sister, why are you hiding the room’s garbage can beneath where you are sitting? Are you hiding something shady inside of it?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao finally laughed loudly, her smile now exceptionally dazzling. It was enough to make people feel at a trance as if they were looking at a gorgeous rose with painful thorns.</p>
<p>“Little Ran, to think a pure girl like you knows this <em>type</em> of thing too well…” Her lips pursed, “Was it your father who taught you? A boyfriend? Or perhaps a f*ck buddy?”</p>
<p>All the colors of Meng Xinran’s face disappeared in a few seconds!</p>
