<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 41 – Worried For Nothing</strong></p>
<p>In the end, holding a snake cage in the left hand and the steamed bun in the right, Yu Yaoyao swaggered home as she succeeded in harvesting a bunch of envious and admirable eyes from the crew.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, the snakes are…uh?” The curious staff could not help but ask.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes shined and looked towards the complex faces of Meng Xinran and Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>With an impish laugh she said, “Ah, yes. The <em>snake</em> opened its mouth today and tried to bite me. I’m going to break the backbone of this son of a b*tch, crush it and skin it!”</p>
<p>She smiled towards Meng Xinran, “I’ll boil it in scalding, hot water with chili and then suffocate it in vermicelli!”</p>
<p>The words she uttered were extremely sharp, but the last sentence was spoken so tenderly that one would almost forget she was d*amning a snake to hell.</p>
<p>“I’ll stew the snake to a soup for my husband, hehe.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes suddenly lit up, <em>So that’s how it is?</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong was following from the bac. His face was so black that it could not be darker anymore!</p>
<p>Once they were out of the set, Yu Yaoyao asked the two men, “Do you like my little gift from work? Baby, husband?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao dangled the cage, smiling triumphantly as if she had taken advantage of a big thing. “Director Li said it was useless and gave it to me. Hehe, one of you can play with it.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun, who was holding hands with his mommy, immediately opened his eyes wide. “Play?” he asked curiously.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t it stew for dad?</em></p>
<p>He looked at the snake and his eyes glistened as swallowed his saliva. But he hasn’t even played with this kind of toy before!</p>
<p>“Oh no, not this snake. This one’s going to be your friend! Do you want to touch the baby? it’s cool and comfortable.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun tilted his head to the side and held out a tender finger curiously towards the snake inside the cage.</p>
<p>Watching his son’s fat and short fingers about to touch the sticky snake body, Shen Yichong’s eyes flickered and his soul was about to fly out from his body.</p>
<p>In a split second, he grabbed his son’s arm and simply said, “You can’t touch the snake.”</p>
<p>This woman just went out to shoot a scene! Why did she bring so many things back home!? And a snake, nonetheless, for each one of them!?</p>
<p>This unexpected visit is actually more tiring than a day of his work in business.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the steamed bun had some grievances against his father, but still listened. Whereas, Yu Yayoao was not angry and only smiled as she went inside the car through the door that Ni Yi had opened.</p>
<p>The steamed bun sat on her left and the snake cage on her right.</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong mouth twitched as he glanced disdainfully at this setup but he still complyingly sat in the front row.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao introduced Shen Rui the steamed bun in the back seat to the little snake’s habits and helped them to be friendly with each other. She also discussed what the snake was to eat together with them for dinner, and soon the conversation between the mother and son took on a comfortable pace until they were both laughing.</p>
<p>Her sharp features looked all a little softer at the moment as if mixed with the brilliance of motherhood. Shen Yichong looked at this display for a while before frowning.</p>
<p>In the middle of the trip, the steamed bun suddenly remembered.</p>
<p><em>Mom didn’t read chicken drumsticks today…</em>He didn’t seem to hear it.</p>
<p>He was worried all the way thinking his mother would do something bad on work. But it was actually the opposite!</p>
<p>He breathed a sigh of relief and his heart was finally completely at rest.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Yu Yaoyao curiously asked.</p>
<p>The steamed bun shook his head and closed his mouth tightly. His mother had been thinking about him all day. He could not tell his mother that he had been doubting her, or she would think he’s a bad boy.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, his little body shook as he glanced down at his little feet with a guilty heart.</p>
