            <p><strong>Chapter 257 – Mr and Mrs. Smith (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: MamaGoose<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>The questions she posed were heavy with possibilities. The passengers enjoying their flight turned to them, amused. The viewers were in a frenzy and the comment section under the live broadcast blew up:</p>
<p><strong>[Sister Y is really witty! The whole program group is going to kneel in defeat and lick the floor before her!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Our Sister YY’s brain is really unbeatable!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Screenwriter: Unexpectedly! The key to the problem-solving of this game lay in the toilet at an altitude of 10,000 meters above the ground!]</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao narrowed her eyes in suspicion. She curled her lips, turned around and walked to the washroom. She reached the washrooms; one was empty and the other was occupied. She peered back at the camera. She pushed the vacant one and stepped back suddenly.</p>
<p>The comment section was overloaded with comments flooding in from so many spectators. They had thought that Yu Yaoyao would miss Shen Yichong yet again. But he was smart. He had waited there for Yu Yaoyao to open the door.</p>
<p>Old Zheng was shocked. Director Zhao almost got a heart attack. But there was still hope. Shen Yichong looked so unlike himself under all the disguise that Yu Yaoyao might not recognize him. However, as Yu Yaoyao had almost been so close to finding him multiple times, everybody thought that the game would be over now.</p>
<p>Before anybody, especially Yu Yaoyao, could dwell on the situation, a young steward suddenly rushed out and closed the door of the washroom. “Sir, please lock the door from inside. We might be affected by turbulence soon, so please make sure to hold the armrest.”</p>
<p>He turned to Yu Yaoyao. “Sorry about that, ma’am. Please go back to your seat temporarily and fasten your seat belt.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was confused. <em>That guy…he somehow smells like my husband, </em>she thought. She sniffed the air for a familiar hint of cologne but quickly reached out and covered her nose. “Ew, the toilet smells.”</p>
<p>Old Zheng breathed a sigh of relief. So did Director Zhao, whose heart had almost burst with the sheer stress of it. Yu Yaoyao walked back to her seat and settled down, frowning. When the turbulence passes, Shen Yichong walked to his seat and Yu Yaoyao looked at his back as he passed her, thinking. He looked at the camera and folded her hands on her lap.</p>
<p>“Well, honey. If you are watching this, you already know that the person didn’t lock the door himself. I wasn’t peeking. I swear he had his pants on, so I saw nothing. But why does he look a bit like you?” She scrunched up her eyebrows, confused. “Anyway, don’t worry. I am only interested in your body,” said she with a smile and a wink.</p>
<p>She looked at Little Bun who had fallen asleep again. The meals arrived and Yu Yaoyao was grateful for the food. She forgot about everything else. Inflight meals weren’t very delicious, but Yu Yaoyao wiped the plate clean to not waste food. She, then, headed to the washroom.</p>
<p>Director Zhao looked at Shen Yichong. “Mr. Shen, it was a stroke of luck that the turbulence was so timely.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, “Indeed.”</p>
<p>Director Zhao said with a smile, “We will get off soon. Mr. Shen, please choose a place on the map. Once you have chosen the place, we will see whether Yu Yaoyao’s sense of smell can still track you down,” he said excitedly. This was getting interesting.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took the pen. The plane landed. Yu Yaoyao took her time to wake Little Bun so he would be refreshed enough to get off. By the time they made their way to the airport exit, Shen Yichong and Director Zhao had already driven off. A map was delivered to her. The staff member who had handed her the map smiled, “Your husband has been escorted to one of these spots. You can set off to track him down.”</p>
<p>“But there are so many locations. Where do I go from here?” she asked anxiously. More than a dozen places were marked on the map.</p>
<p>“That depends on the understanding between you and your husband, ma’am,” the staff said, “there is no hint.”</p>
<p>Little Bun puffed out his cheeks. The staff left them. As soon as the staff was gone, Yu Yaoyao grinned. Those who were familiar with her sneaky grin would know that she was up to something. Director Zhao was most familiar with the grin, and it made his heartbeat faster in fear. On the screen, he could see that she had reached into her pocket. “She’s hiding money again!” he exclaimed. Shen Yichong’s tried to suppress his smile.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao had taken out a piece of paper from her pocket. She grinned and unfolded the paper and showed it to the camera. Three words were visible:</p>
<p><strong>Meat, Hands-on, Flowers</strong></p>
<p>The viewers were stunned and the comment section, yet again, was flooded by remarks which never seemed to end:</p>
<p><strong>[F*ck f*ck! Where did this come from!?}</strong></p>
<p><strong>[My God, when did Mr. Shen leave it to Sister Y?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Damn! Mr. and Mrs. Smith much?!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The program crew was tricked, right?! If she got the code at the toilet, doesn’t this mean that Sister Yu already knew the fat man was her husband even before getting off the plane?!!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Ouch, do you still remember? Sister Yu that she’ll let her husband follow the Director and enjoy to his heart’s content, so there was no need for him to be found by her so quickly?]</strong></p>
<p>Director Zhao coughed up a mouthful of water and almost shed tears as he scrolled through the comments.</p>
