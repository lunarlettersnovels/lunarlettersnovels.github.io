            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 282 – Warm Soup (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>“Oh,” said Chen Lin, “The boss has a lunch appointment today. There is an audition for the movie the company invested in. So, the Director invited him.” Chen Lin finished, awkwardly.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s face fell. “Really?” she said, “I thought he didn’t do so much work in the day. Thought that was the reason why he seemed so energetic at night.” Chen Lin blushed, unable to find any words to diffuse the situation. He looked up and saw Shen Yichong approach from the elevator. He was now standing behind her.</p>
<p>“Boss!” Chen Lin was never so happy to see his boss before.</p>
<p>“Honey,” he said. Yu Yaoyao turned around; her disappointment gone from her face to be replaced by a smile.</p>
<p>“I made chicken soup for you. I wanted to have lunch with you,” she said, “But it seems you have an appointment. It’s alright. I will call Little Sisi for lunch instead.” She said and looked around to find Chen Lin turning the other side and busy on his phone. She stood on her tiptoe and placed a kiss on his cheek. “I will let you get back to work then. Bye.”</p>
<p>She turned to leave and scrolled through her phone to call Ren Sitong. But Shen Yichong wrapped his arm around her waist, stopping her. He took the lunch bag from her hands.</p>
<p>“Did you cook this for me all by yourself?” he asked, eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, “But you can eat it later at home, if you are busy.”</p>
<p>Everything clicked into place. She was trying so hard to get the recipe right that she was practicing how to make the chicken soup every day. This was what he had smelled on her. He was touched.</p>
<p>“Nope,” he said, “You put so much effort in this. Can’t let it go to waste now, can I?” he said, smiling. He opened the lid of the lunch box. The chicken soup smelled divine. “The actress playing the lead role would be auditioning after lunch, you should come with me.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was surprised at the invitation. “Really?” she asked. He ushered her into his office and took her phone from her, which she was still holding up about to call Ren Sitong. He placed it on the table.</p>
<p>“You will be auditioning for a lead role from the look of everything,” he said, “You can just see how it’s done, if you want.”</p>
<p>“Chen Lin,” he called. Chen Lin had followed them into the office as well. “Please call Director Ma and relay to him that my wife will be accompanying me to the audition. As for the lunch, send him my apologies. Send one of the staff on my behalf.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong picked the lunch bag and went out of the office, his arms on Yu yaoyao’s waist. Chen Lin couldn’t stop him even if he wanted to. It was up to him now to convince Director Ma so that he wouldn’t be offended.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Director Ma Zhiguo had reached early, and waited on the 66th floor of a well-known Music Restaurant in the city center. He was smiling and conversing with Chen Jiao and Ling Shuang*.</p>
<p><em>*Recap: Ling Shuang is the female lead who ends up with Shen Yichong in the original storyline.</em></p>
<p>“Mr. Shen will arrive shortly,” he said to his guests, “The lead role has always been Mr. Shen’s concern. He is of the opinion that the lead role is the most difficult and brilliant role that makes or breaks any kind of story. There are a few other actors who will be arriving for the audition in the afternoon, but Little Ling, you seemed to be the best candidate for the job. I had intended to introduce you to Mr. Shen during the audition later. But no matter. It’s such a pleasant coincidence that you guys are also eating at this place. You can just meet him here!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao smiled. “Yes,” he said sweetly, “What a coincidence!”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang bowed her head gratefully. “I will definitely make the most of this opportunity and give it my all in the audition later, Director Ma,” she said, “Let me just toast with tea instead of alcohol since we still have to work later.” She laughed and raised her glass. “Cheers!”</p>
<p>Director Ma Zhiguo was appreciative of her frank and open attitude and clinked his teacup with Ling Shuang’s in good faith. Ling Shuang glanced at the clock on the wall. It was five past twelve.</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth. “Director Ma, can I ask you some more questions about the role?” she asked, trying to steer his attention to her. Chen Jiao frowned but remained silent. In a few minutes, there was a warm greeting that came from a middle-aged man from a distance.</p>
<p>“Director Ma, it’s been a while!” said the man cordially, “Mr. Shen had an urgent last-minute commitment, so I came in his place. I hope that is okay. Also, he sends a small request your way. For the afternoon audition, he requests to attend it with his wife.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s pretty face turned pale all of a sudden and she grimaced. “Yu Yaoyao is coming to watch?” she whispered to herself.</p>
