            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 101 – Take Out</strong></p>
<p>“Shen Rui tell your mother good night. You should go to sleep now.” When Shen Yichong heard the voice, he was stunned and hastily asked his son to lie down his bed. He then looked at Yu Yaoyao in the video with a dark, poisonous look.</p>
<p>His unpleasant face spoke volumes telling her not to do something she would regret.</p>
<p>“Don’t turn off the video… take your order first.”</p>
<p>Is he worried about her safety? In the past, back when she was still at the zoo, she saw a drama where a wife who was home alone also informed her husband when a courier was at their house.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao thought this was understandable, and a sweet smile graced her face. Her eyes looked adoringly at him as she softly touched the image of the man in the video.</p>
<p>“Okay,” her delicate voice echoed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was in the middle of walking outside his son’s room, tablet in hand and out from the little bun’s earshot. When he heard her reply, his body couldn’t but feel on edge. Yu Yaoyao’s video call had become unstable in the screen. With this, he knew that she was going to open the door any time soon.</p>
<p>From the bottom, her entire delicate swan neck was visible from the camera’s lenses; her cheeks were still a bit reddish due to the steam from the recent shower, and with the pink pajamas she wore, she was like a ripe, juicy peach waiting for someone to devour her!</p>
<p>A frown was immediately on Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>“Wait,” he spoke.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao placed the tablet closer and stopped walking so she could look at the man on the screen, “Yes?” With just one, soft word, it was like water was dripping near his ears.</p>
<p>“Speak properly.” Shen Yichong’s face was black, and as he looked at the delicate red lips that appeared in the video at this moment, he found out that he did not feel the usual burst of irritability inside his heart… Moreover, her face was bare after just showering, but her lips, pink and soft, seemed to be more inviting.</p>
<p>“Do not speak like that,” Shen Yichong found himself speaking in frustration. “Especially since you are working outside alone. Furthermore, you are a woman, pay more attention. Don’t provoke–”</p>
<p><em>–other men. </em>The last two words became stuck inside his throat.</p>
<p>Sometime later, she will be finally free. She will be able to do any <em>activity</em> outside, provided that the media don’t discover her by that time, who she likes and how her life progress will have nothing to do with him anymore.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s face was hard. Yet, when he thought of this, his chest felt unexpectedly heavy. And when he looked at her face a second time on the screen, his eyes narrowing at her neckline with the first button undone, he angrily reprimanded, “Yu Yaoyao, when you are outside, do not provoke other men!”</p>
<p>What he said was different from what he thought.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was facing the screen, nodded amiably, her smile lovely as a flower. “Of course, my husband. I will listen to you.”</p>
<p>She is not planning for a divorce. How can she leave such a good life behind? There are little puddings she has yet to eat in the future. Moreover, who’ll take care of the little bun? Not to mention, she has a diamond husband…</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded and gestured with his eyes, signalling her to open the door, this prompted Yu Yaoyao to snort as she moved forward. Her pitiful expression seemed to be like an obedient but bullied, little wife—he didn’t know if he felt touched or numb at the moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Meng Xinran was still at the party inside the restaurant, browsing through Weibo while being vigilant with the time.</p>
<p>The drug was known to be very strong and would only take up to ten minutes for it to take effect. She watched the clock tick slowly, and after a quarter of an hour, she looked towards Yu Yaoyao’s empty seat pretending to be surprised.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu has been gone so long and still hasn’t come back.”</p>
<p>When the female contestants at the same table heard it, their expressions became that of curiosity. They all couldn’t help but comment and probe on the matter.</p>
<p>“Did she go back to her room?”</p>
<p>“We were all eating and filming… what can she be doing alone in her room?”</p>
<p>Everyone wished they could still have more screen time and wanted to stay until the director finished filming them.</p>
<p>But then Meng Xinran’s sweet face put on a worried façade. “Isn’t it a bit worrying? She only sat here for less than an hour. Why don’t we all see sister Yu? It’s her first time living away from the comfort of her home, and nothing must happen to her.”</p>
<p>Some of the players were unwilling to depart, but when they looked at Meng Xinran’s exclusive cameraman in tow, they became were moved. They thought it was also a sign of goodwill to visit a possibly sick contestant. Besides, they will have more shots than the other contestants!</p>
<p>“All right, I also brought with me some medicine for colds and an upset stomach. If sister is truly sick, then she can have it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s go together,” they all agreed.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran laughed. Now she has witnesses to see Yu Yaoyao do the vulgar! And now that she had climbed so high, the fall would naturally be steep! She also hired a tabloid reporter to snoop from the outside so that the photo will be spread to the media as soon as possible! Even if the program decided to block this news from becoming public, it would be impossible to do so.</p>
<p>Anticipation filled her to the point that she couldn’t sit still. Especially when she thought of the <em>beautiful</em> scenes, she was about to see inside the room.</p>
