            <p><strong>Chapter 395</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>The last episode of ‘My Wife and I’ was nothing but cruel irony to Chen Jiao. But to other audiences, it was a super reluctant farewell.</p>
<p>The audience was so used to the show being broadcasted every week for almost two months that for many it had become part of their weekend relaxation.</p>
<p>In the last episode, almost everyone in the comments was saying things like, ‘It’s such a shame it’s finished’, ‘When is the second season?’, ‘I need more episodes’.</p>
<p>Even the two other less popular families gained more popularity during this period of time.</p>
<p>In this episode, the total broadcast time for the families was 18 minutes. The first two groups of families accounted for a total of 10 minutes, while the remaining 8 minute went to Yaoyao’s family. It was for this reason that the fans of the first two families were dissatisfied.</p>
<p><em>[ Ever since the first episode Yu Yaoyao has always had the most shots. It’s now the last episode; why can’t the program be fairer?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is the airtime distributed based on who creates the most traffic? You ranked the worthless ones last?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Dissatisfied!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I just want to say that I think everyone should get equal airtime in the last episode. Wouldn’t it be great?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is it because Mr. Shen is rich? Did he also sponsor this program?]</em></p>
<p>Many people on the comments were criticizing the program team, but the comments were soon overwhelmed by the YY fans.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the YY fans had always been very disciplined. They endured and tolerated these people, not so much as even cursing them. They all just started spamming the comments the minute Yaoyao appeared. All the positive comments buried the negative comments.</p>
<p>The point was that the wives from the two other families were friends of their Yaoyao! The fans restrained themselves as they didn’t want to damage the friendships between their Yaoyao and her friends.</p>
<p>When her clips finally appeared, they were all so excited! Although they were sad, they put their sorrow away the minute Yu Yaoyao appeared.</p>
<p>For the first two families, one husband gifted his wife a golden microphone he had used for his concert, while the other gifted his wife a 12-day trip to Europe. Shen Yichong’s gifts overshadowed them all.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the program, the director of ‘My Wife and I’ said he had aimed to reveal the way celebrity couples got along with each other. And he hoped that the couples, who had been married for a long time, could return to the feelings they had felt when they first fell in love.</p>
<p>The audience couldn’t express their feelings in words when they saw Yu Yaoyao accept the transfer of Shen Yichong’s assets. They could never know whether the couple felt those feelings they had felt when they had first fallen in love, but they could feel their love at the moment.</p>
<p>This was especially true for the YY fans who had been following her from the beginning. They were all felt overwhelmed by the love in the air!</p>
<p><em>[I cried. I just went to look up Yaoyao’s manifesto in ‘Stage’. She said she wanted to become stronger with Mr. Shen and not let the public opinion defeat her. This time, Mr. Shen is the one who’s treating her wholeheartedly.]</em></p>
<p><em>[What kind of sweet relationship is this-]</em></p>
<p><em>[Now that it’s done, I want to watch it again!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Reminds me of the clips when Yaoyao was finding her husband and teaching her son about saving money… Who said that there aren’t any good men in the world? One really can exchange sincerity for sincerity!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Obviously it’s a scene for show off, but it’s full of happy bubbles and the taste of love!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I can watch this show 100 times over!]</em></p>
<p>Fans and other spectators alike went crazy on the comments. The audience who had been fighting for the other two families stayed quiet at that moment. Whether it was a show or a genuine gift, was the transfer of more than a billion assets not worth an extra hour?</p>
<p>Many viewers who liked to watch this show were women. Most of them were either in love or married. Even the audience who were single were at the age that was full of the yearning for love.</p>
<p>Could their current or future husband or boyfriend ever get to this level? Would they dare to guarantee that in the future, for whatever reason, once, and if they divorced, that they would leave all their assets to their wives and leave the family without anything?</p>
<p>They couldn’t help thinking about this at that moment. And they all came to the same conclusion; the answer was probably no.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it wasn’t just the wealthy people who would do notarization of pre-marital property. Even the ordinary folk would do it before marriage, claiming that the property and assets they owned before marriage belonged only to themselves.</p>
<p>If the wife really did do something wrong in the future, not even the property the couple bought together would be divided equally.</p>
<p>What Shen Yichong had done was a demonstration of just how much trust he had in his wife. And when he hugged her on the show, it was a public confession of his trust and love.</p>
<p>Money was originally just a symbol to him, but she was the one who made him feel like it had meaning. He wanted to earn more money because he wanted her and their child to be as happy and comfortable as possible.</p>
<p>This kind of confession was really a different type of romance.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had suddenly become a rich woman overnight. She even had a chance of being listed as a billionaire on the Forbes list next year!</p>
<p>After being lost in the moment, the fans finally came back to their senses.</p>
<p>“Our Yaoyao is a billionaire?”</p>
<p>“My idol became a billionaire overnight. My mother will no longer shun me for being obsessed with artists.”</p>
<p>The fans couldn’t wait to share this breaking news with their friends.</p>
