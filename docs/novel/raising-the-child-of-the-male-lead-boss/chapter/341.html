<p><strong>Chapter 422</strong></p>
<p>As soon as the news was released, cat owners got very excited.</p>
<p>They even released the script roles for different cats, from wild cats to domestic cats, as well as the style and characteristics for the protagonist and supporting roles. The cat owners who lived close to the shooting location all wanted to participate. Even if they didn’t get selected, they still got to show their cats off at the cat party.</p>
<p>The public also got to vote for their favorite candidate after Guangxin had finalized the list. This activity was determined during the conversation between Shen Yichong and Da Fu, whose intention was that cat lovers could also participate in the production. For this movie project, Da Fu, on the one hand, got to realize his dream of becoming a director.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he got to commemorate a cat of his who passed away. For him, the purpose of commemoration was greater than making money. Therefore, he hoped that the cat lovers could create their own memories with their pets through this method.</p>
<p>As for Shen Yichong, he thought that such distinctive focus activities could replace the normal marketing and promotion for this film project. The end of October was Yu Yaoyao’s expected delivery period. He also wanted to prepare a grand and unique gift for his unborn baby daughter. He hoped that such a relaxed and warm movie could be enjoyed by his baby daughter in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, Shen Yichong also abandoned the idea of ​​pursuing profitability this time. From the perspective of a father, he wanted to make a cute pet movie that all the girls would like. While wanting to make the children’s childhood richer and more colorful, he also hoped the movie was somehow educational so that children will treasure every single life from a young age.</p>
<p>In this way, the two men reached a consensus on the project. The investment process went smoothly, and the project officially started!</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, once again had a little dispute with the father and son about whether to participate in the premiere of ‘Year’.</p>
<p>They had returned home last week. The shooting locations of the variety show had also moved from scenic spots to their own house with better medical care.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was gradually entering the trimester of her pregnancy, and the father and son had also fully entered a state of alert. They didn’t want Yu Yaoyao to pick up any unnecessary job, let alone going to a crowded public place.</p>
<p>“There’ll be many reporters and fans at the premiere. Even if there are security guards, it’ll be difficult to ensure everyone’s safety.” Shen Yichong vetoed her decision directly. “You can say hello to everyone through a video. Be good, let’s not go this time.”</p>
<p>Little bun also nodded repeatedly.</p>
<p>“But… I’ve already asked Ni Yi to help me choose the outfit~” Yu Yaoyao bulged her cheeks. “Darling, you’ve bought me several beautiful maternity dresses, but I’ve never showcased them to anyone. What a pity.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong replied without hesitation, “You can wear it. I’ll see it.”</p>
<p>Little bun also echoed, “Yes! Mommy, I’ll also see it! Mommy is beautiful every day!”</p>
<p>The father and son did not even waver after Yu Yaoyao complained again.</p>
<p>Finally, Shen Yichong called Chen Lin, “Get the assistant who specializes in filming for Director Li. Ask him to come over to shoot the short video for the premiere of ‘Year’.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong knew that his wife’s habit of showing off had started again.</p>
<p>She could only be comforted at this moment. Otherwise, she would cry at any second during her pregnancy.</p>
<p>“I’ll let someone shoot the video for you. You can show the people the dress you like,” he said. “We’ll shoot in the small garden at home. We can put the deck chairs over there, among the flowers.”</p>
<p>Little bun also nodded, “Get the make-up artist here too, so mommy would look perfect~”</p>
<p>In the end, Yu Yaoyao had no choice but to agree.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the day of shooting, Zhao Yu, who learned that Yu Yaoyao was going to work, also shamelessly came to join in the fun, and shot a new series of the variety show.</p>
<p>Now that the father and son were controlling the situation strictly, he could only do things as he saw fit.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was also very familiar with the guests this round. They were Zhao Xiaomeng and Qiu Dajian from “In The Limelight”, who had the best relationship with her.</p>
<p>Since the web drama was broadcasted, Dajian has reached a new peak of popularity. He was very popular among young girls recently. Zhao Xiaomeng had also signed with Guangxin. She had recently finished filming and was on a break.</p>
<p>As soon as they came, Qiu Dajian teased the two snakes in Yu Yaoyao’s living room through a glass box, and he grinned when Little Bun fed them meat.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng, on the other hand, was chatting with Yu Yaoyao. She helped her in choosing today’s dress.</p>
<p>Even when Yu Yaoyao was about to give birth, there was still no sign of weight gained on her face.</p>
<p>“That’s because I eat a lot less. I couldn’t drink milk tea, eat fried foods or snacks… I had no way of getting fat.”</p>
<p>Her face got even more fair as she hadn’t worked for a long time. It obviously had been well taken care of. It was rosy and shiny, and the skin condition was already very good without any foundation.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng was very envious, “You never get fat easily, and there was never any excess flesh on your face. It’s all collagen.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled and picked up a piece of clothing in the closet, gesturing to her body, “That was when I was forced to do yoga and exercise, and you didn’t even see it. Little Mengmeng, which color do you think looks better?”</p>
<p>“The sky-blue color fits your skin, but you wore that during the last premiere; the light yellow, I think it fits you too… Pink…” Zhao Xiaomeng was giving feedback for each of the dresses.</p>
<p>None of them knew that at the back door of the premiere movie theater, several bald men with nervous expressions and twinkling eyes were hovering outside the door. It was not until half an hour later that they left the scene in a hurry after not seeing their target person, after confirming that all the leading actors of the film had arrived.</p>
