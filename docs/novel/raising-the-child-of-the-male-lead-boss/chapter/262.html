<p><strong>Chapter 499</strong></p>
<p>Li Bo did not expect that after two years, Yu Yaoyao’s acting skills would not only be perfected, but her ability to teach others was also immaculate; she seemed to have a strong charm and leadership. She twisted all the actors in the crew into a tightrope!</p>
<p>“Our slogan is: ‘No<em> NG! We go home early!’</em> Read it again with me!”</p>
<p>These days, when Li Bo arrived on the set half an hour earlier than usual, he would be taken aback by Yu Yaoyao’s roar. Before he was able go into the director’s lounge to place his belongings, he heard the disciplined shouts from outside. Not only that, Yu Yaoyao also had everyone run in the morning.</p>
<p>“Come to your senses people! Do you want to be scolded by Director Li like a dog again!?”</p>
<p>“Stay healthy! We don’t take sick leaves! We don’t excuse ourselves, and we don’t fall down until the filming is over!”</p>
<p>“Concentrate and tell yourself that you are the character, and the character is you!”</p>
<p>“Show Director Li that all of us could offer first-class performances, even though we are just pretty but useless group performers, old but handsome actors!”</p>
<p>Li Bo: “…”</p>
<p>Was Yu Yaoyao still holding a grudge? Back then, he had said that she was pretty but useful, and she still remembered it vividly…</p>
<p>The male lead Lu Cheng ran behind Yu Yaoyao, and raised his eyebrows when he heard the words. “Who is old but handsome? Xiaoyao, are you talking about me? Ah? My mental age is only eighteen! My appearance is even more natural skin that does not need wrinkle removal shots…” he lamented in a defensive tone.</p>
<p>“Prrr-tt!” A whistle sounded nearby. Shen Rui was standing on a wooden box outside the track. He immediately waved the red flag. “Uncle Lu Cheng, don’t talk! Run seriously and shout the slogan!”</p>
<p>Lu Cheng immediately looked at him resentfully. “Yes, coach!” he could only reply.</p>
<p>The ‘coach’ nodded with satisfaction. “Continue!” he said.</p>
<p>Li Bo, who was watching from the side, was amazed.</p>
<p>He didn’t know that the spirits of the crew could be fostered like this  and it made him ashamed. After watching for a while, he shook his head and went to the side to plan the scene.</p>
<p>When the actual filming started, Li Bo discovered that the devil morning exercise had a unique power. After working out in the morning, everyone’s concentration seemed to have improved! And after being brainwashed by the slogan, every actor seemed to have the slogan ingrained in their brains:<em> ‘I am the character, and the character is me!’  </em>The feelings they poured for their performance was burning with passion!</p>
<p>The average of NGs in the crew has dropped significantly, and Li Bo also felt the magic. Generally speaking, comedy films made actors laugh easily while filming. But now, none of the actors seemed to be laughing awkwardly. When they all became their comedic characters in the script, they were immersed in it. All of them acted their own lines naturally; no one felt awkward performing.</p>
<p>Li Bo felt like he was dreaming, this filming was a bit too worry-free! Even when NG appeared, the actors would be even more anxious than him.</p>
<p>“D*mn it! Have I used all my NG quota today? Will I get no wine to drink, but Sister Yao’s whip? Noooo!”</p>
<p>“I have one more chance. My last chance! I must pass it the next take! Brother, don’t hold me back! Otherwise, I’ll fight you!”</p>
<p>“Sis, don’t resent me, but your expression a while ago was a little fake. Your gaze should be a little more sad!”</p>
<p>“Bro, your hairstyle is a bit messy. I’ll fix it for you first, otherwise it’ll make me laugh. What should I do…”</p>
<p>Li Bo wanted to educate the group performers and the second female lead, but there was no chance at all. The actors shared their woes and began helping each other. They were all thinking together how to act better, and they were supervising each other’s performances. became useless.  Either Yu Yaoyao or the little kid, Shen Rui, would also always solve the problems whenever they encountered one.</p>
<p>As a director, he suddenly</p>
<p>“Mummy, I watched your performance just now. It seems that your left hand is not very beautiful. You can try moving it to the middle of the table,” the Little BUn instructed. “Uncle Lu Cheng, go a little further to the left. Also, when my dad is standing, he rarely puts his hands in his pockets. You won’t look cool when you put your hands in like this. Come, I’ll show you how my dad stands.”</p>
<p>Since Little Bun always followed Shen Yichong to the crew, he was already correcting the actors’ performance after a few days of filming!</p>
<p>Li Bo: “…”</p>
<p>It seemed that he was completely useless as a director..? Li Bo’s lines were taken away by everyone. Even the times he scolded people on the set was now much less frequent. As long as there was an NG, someone would scold on his behalf, and those people were always faster than him.</p>
<p>He also got to shoot one-third more shots each day than he originally planned. The progress of the entire crew was advancing at a fast speed. It seemed that the task could be completed ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>“Old Hang, there are really talented people in the industry. If this goes on, we will all lose our jobs.”</p>
<p>Li Bo couldn’t help feeling overwhelmed in the evening and got on the phone with Qi Hang. Qi Hang, who went from an NG devil to director who would pass the shots in one shot, should be the one who could understand his feelings the most. But Qi Hang has never experienced Li Bo’s pain…who did not even get the opportunity to talk to the actors.</p>
<p>“Old Li, did you just say that your job is taken by Yu Yaoyao? Even her son who hasn’t gone to school – oh, who is already in elementary school by the way – teaches everyone how to perform?” Qi Hang’s disbelieving voice echoed. Then, laughter followed. “Ha-ha! Are you trying to make me dead by laughing too much? Are you trying to distract me so you can win this year?”</p>
<p>“Get lost!” Li Bo howled. He was so annoyed that even his beard was going to be crooked from the anger. “Laugh my *ss! I know you didn’t let Wei Ming and Lu Cheng learn how to perform with Yu Yaoyao at that time! You and I are just similar!”</p>
<p>Having said that, Director Qi Hang also came back to his senses.</p>
<p>“She is an actor, and she knows better than us how to get actors immersed…” Lu Cheng said thoughtfully. “As directors, we can spend our energy on controlling the big picture and the storyboard, the rhythm and technique of the entire narrative!”</p>
<p>“How brazen!” Li Bo cursed. “Half of the Best Feature Film award should be credited to Xiao Yu!”</p>
<p>“Are you jealous? Come and bite me then!”</p>
<p>Li Bo hung up the phone with a snap! This Old Hang was really annoying! Originally, he wanted to share with him the training method to twist the crew into a tightrope. But forget that now, he had given up!</p>
<p>“If this really works… it can also be applied to the rest of the crew, right?” he pondered.</p>
<p>Director Li Bo finally found what he should do.</p>
