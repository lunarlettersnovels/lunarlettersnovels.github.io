            <p><strong>Chapter 356</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Guo Li hurriedly bowed in apology.</p>
<p>But Ling Shuang felt so wronged. It was as if the man she loved was abandoning her in front of her own eyes. Her eyes reddened with tears of rage. “I didn’t do anything to her. It was her who teamed up with my manager and tried to harm me. I was being beaten up by the group actors because of them…” she lifted up her sleeves as she spoke, revealing countless bruises.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong didn’t want to listen to a word she said. He asked Yu Yaoyao in a low voice, “Why did you leave the crew by yourself? Next time, bring Ni Yi or your manager if you have something to do. I get worried when you’re alone.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ling Shuang didn’t feel the pain in the places where she had been hit. She only felt that her heart was about to be shattered into pieces.</p>
<p>“Darling, I didn’t suffer any injuries, but she… Wronged me. She accused me of things I never did. I’m so upset…” Yu Yaoyao immediately buried her pitiful face against Shen Yichong’s chest. She did know how to act the part. “Darling, you know me… I don’t even bully the stray dogs on the side of the road, and I would even bring an injured snake home and take care of it. I’m so sad that she wronged me like this…” as Yu Yaoyao spoke, she pulled Shen Yichong’s sleeve and used it to wipe the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>As expected, Shen Yichong’s face turned cold, “Don’t be afraid, I am here.”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s chest suddenly filled with anger and pain. She pointed at Guo Li and shouted, “Broth… Mr. Shen, this manager of mine, she took advantage of the fact that Brother Jiao can’t use his cell phone when he’s in the crew. She picked up all these messy jobs for me. She even came over to talk to your wife. They have been in cahoots this entire time!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows. He quickly picked out the meaning behind her words “Chen Jiao?”</p>
<p>“Yes! The truth will come to light when my brother is free of the crew!” Ling Shuang cried out, “I’m begging you, Mr. Shen. They got someone to watch me closely and wouldn’t let me leave. They let the group actors beat me up over and over again. Please save me. Please contact my brother for me. Please send me over to my brother’s crew!” Her clear watery eyes were full of crystal tears at that moment. Her eyelashes trembled, and a line of tears rolled down her cheeks, washing away the gray stains on her face. This only made her look even more pitiful.</p>
<p>However, her pitiful image was shattered in the next second.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hugged Shen Yichong’s arm and started to cry, “Darling, didn’t Bro Chen send me a message yesterday? He said he wanted to meet me…”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang, who was still holding herself and shivering on the ground, raised her pale face in disbelief upon hearing this. “Brother Jiao asked you out?” she looked at Yu Yaoyao in astonishment. Then, she looked at Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Why would Brother Jiao do that? Had he asked Yu Yaoyao out so he could avenge her? Did he intentionally want to create a rumor that they were having an affair to make Shen Yichong jealous and doubt his wife? Had he been trying to give her a chance with Shen Yichong?</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s brain worked quickly. But when her fiery gaze fell on Shen Yichong’s face, she couldn’t find a trace of doubt or dissatisfaction on it. Instead, his gaze was filled with love and pampering.</p>
<p>How was this possible?</p>
<p>Was Shen Yichong not jealous when Yu Yaoyao confessed to him? Brother Jiao’s strategy had gone unexpectedly wrong …</p>
<p>Ling Shuang sighed regretfully. She felt a sudden pain at the corner of her mouth. When she stretched out her hand to touch it, she saw the black and green bruises on her arm. Suddenly, she felt like she was being hit on her head, and she finally came back to her senses. If Brother Jiao had time to send text messages to Yu Yaoyao, why couldn’t he come to her? He used to talk to her every day, unless he had been extremely busy with the crew.</p>
<p>“Impossible! Why would my brother contact you? If he were free, he would definitely come to see me first!” Ling Shuang’s miserable eyes changed to a look of panic. She looked at Guo Li and Yu Yaoyao in horror. “Wait, did the two of you unite and lie to my brother? Is that why he hasn’t come to see me?” Ling Shuang’s back was suddenly soaked with sweat.</p>
<p>At the beginning, she thought about resisting the crew, but the director had secretly threatened her. He’d said that if the news of her unwillingness to play in minor roles was spread, her reputation in the entertainment industry would be ruined, and that she would never be able to win awards in this life. Therefore, she couldn’t escape these infamous characters. The only thing she could do was wait for Chen Jiao to rescue her when he was finally out of the crew.</p>
<p>But… why did he not contact her when he could call and send text messages?</p>
<p>Yesterday, when she had been acting in a scene where she’d been immersed in a pig cage, she’d even taken a waterproof bag and hid her mobile phone with her in case he had called halfway through the take. She refused to leave it with Guo Li for safekeeping, no matter what.</p>
<p>“Impossible! My brother will not abandon me!” Ling Shuang said as her lips turned pale.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was her last… No. He had always been her only lifeline. He was the most important factor in keeping her life together.</p>
<p>“I never lie. Please don’t accuse me of that. If you don’t believe me, I’ll try to call him. Let’s see if he wants to come over here and clear things up,” Yu Yaoyao pouted as she took her phone out.</p>
<p>She dialed his number, and her call was instantly connected. She even put it on speaker phone.</p>
<p>In a single second, Chen Jiao’s ecstatic and excited voice sounded, “Xiao Yao. Can I call you that? You’re finally willing to answer my call!”</p>
<p>The only thing that rang through Ling Shuang’s mind was a dull thud as her body collapsed to the ground.</p>
