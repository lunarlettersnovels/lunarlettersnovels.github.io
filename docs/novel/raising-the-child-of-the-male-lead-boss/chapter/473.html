<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 290 – Rainy Day (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Two hours later, Yu Yaoyao looked at the empty wine bottle on the table, toppled to its side and massaged her sore waist. So much for her ‘she pushed him on the desk’ storyline. The desk was of solid wood, and she felt like her back wasn’t her own.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong rubbed her back, laughing in a low voice, with his head on her neck. “You can be on the top, next time,” he chuckled. “Sorry.”</p>
<p>In the end, the driver still came and dropped them off to their home. Yu Yaoyao wanted to wipe that smirk off Shen Yichong’s face. He was still grinning!</p>
<p>She called Sisi when she got to her room. “I got bullied Sisi,” she whined, “I don’t think I will be delivering chicken soup again! The bed at home is softer and more comfortable.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong quickened his steps, seeing Shen Rui tailing him at home. Little Bun had heard his mom complaining on the phone about his dad ‘bullying’ her in the office, unaware of what it actually meant, he gave his father a disapproving and angry look.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled at his son and picked him up in his arms. “Where is that homework assigned by the violin teacher?” he said, trying to distract his son, “Show me. I am going to check it.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the internet was buzzing with the news that ‘The Queen of Flourishing Age’ was about to be broadcasted. Because of the Meng Xinran incident, the marketing for the TV series was put on hold. The original bookings of several TV broadcast channels had been cancelled. The production company was debating going online wholly with the TV series.</p>
<p>They had deleted and edited out many scenes with Meng Xinran’s which left the second female lead with more screen time. The post-production and reshooting the scenes gave Director Li Bo a migraine. With Yu Yaoyao’s rise to fame, she was the most searched celebrity as soon as the trailer of the show was released.</p>
<p>The trailer showed Yu Yaoyao’s snake dance with actress Jia Fei. The fans were shocked to see so many snakes crawling on Yu Yaoyao’s body. In the recent live broadcast of ‘My Wife and I’ Yu Yaoyao had revealed that she couldn’t eat snake meat. Most of her fans had assumed that it was because she was afraid of snakes. They had not expected her to be taking part in a show where she had to allow snakes to crawl on her body.</p>
<p>The release of trailer came as a pleasant surprise for many fans of Yu Yaoyao:</p>
<p><strong>【My sister is super impressive. No one can beat her! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【Super professional! The trembling corners of the mouth, the panicked gaze. She must be scared for real! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【I can really be a lifetime fan of hers~】</strong></p>
<p>But amidst these comments, there was a stranger comment that caught everyone’s attention. It was from none other than Ren Sitong:</p>
<p><strong>【Ren Sitong V: Husband Yaoyao, you are so brave and amazing! They seem to swim on your broad shoulders~ (kiss) By the way, are these the two little snakes that you let me play with last time? Wow, they look so fierce on TV! I’m so scared~】</strong></p>
<p>The comment had left many people feeling confused. Eventually, Yu Yaoyao replied on her Weibo:</p>
<p><strong>【Yu Yaoyao V: @Ren Sitong, my wifey, kisses for you! Yes, those are them! They got a lot fatter now. I am trying to take them for walks so they can lose some weight~ Miss you so much! Wanna have a meal together tomorrow? Bring your kids along for a picnic!】</strong></p>
<p>There was a selfie attached to this reply, of Yu Yaoyao making a kissing face, holding the snake to her cheek. The fans were stunned with yet another revelation. Yu Yaoyao wasn’t scared of snakes. She couldn’t eat them because she had them as pets!</p>
<p>Even Director Zhao was speechless. Yu Yaoyao had already showcased her indifference to insects and bugs on his show. She seemed unfazed by snakes as well. She was quite something.</p>
<p>Many fans applauded her for her courage and sent her encouragements through their comments:</p>
<p><strong>【If Yu Yaoyao isn’t even scared of snakes, she is practically invincible. Her acting is suberb! Best Actress Award this year is surely hers! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【At this time, I feel there’s a need @Chen Jiao : Originally, sister wasn’t competing for the best actor award with you. Now, it’s hard to say. Perhaps Yu Yaoyao will win this! 】</strong></p>
<p>The last comment garnered a lot of attention and likes. There were a lot of fans of Chen Jiao. He was very popular right now in the Showbiz industry. The fans had urged him not to leave on retreat lest his Best Actor Award be passed onto somebody else. It seemed now that he had a tough competition with a formidable actress.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang, who had failed the audition, was aggravated by the comments so she angrily uninstalled Weibo from her phone. Meanwhile, Chen Jiao felt confused. This had nothing to do with him, and yet, his skills were being criticized online.</p>
