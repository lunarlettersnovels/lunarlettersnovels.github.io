<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 46 – Fixated On Her</strong></p>
<p>After dinner, Shen Yichong took his son for a late-night bath.</p>
<p>Although this little guy turned to look back at least three times and moved step by step so slowly like a turtle, to look at Yu Yaoyao going at the opposite direction, he was still pulled away by his father who had no expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Shen Rui, you are already a smart child. You should know that your body is different from that of a girl.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun immediately looked at his father with resentment.</p>
<p><em>Mom’s right. Dad’s definitely a cheapskate. </em></p>
<p>Just because he told his father this afternoon that he has to learn to sleep on his own, this father was now thinking of ways to plot out his revenge on him!</p>
<p>And obviously, his dad is also very stupid, that he cannot even memorize his lines, and he didn’t even know how to convey the feelings of the script with the proper facial expressions.</p>
<p><em>Dad doesn’t know how to move his face! </em></p>
<p>Seeing his son’s expression scrunched to a glower, he added, “Ask the children at the kindergarten if they are ashamed to ask their mothers to take a bath with them. They’ll answer, ‘<em>it’s because I’m already old.</em>’”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong carried the steamed bun into the warm water inside the bathtub before he could protest and took off his baby clothes.</p>
<p>The steamed bun instantly flushed in shame and covered his fat, snowy ass. “I can take off my trousers by myself and let mom bathe me!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…Be a good boy. ”</p>
<p>After the steamed bun was washed forcefully by his father, in the end he was like a hot, freshly baked meat bun with a plump, red face. Cheeks soft and fat, and very elastic.</p>
<p>He entangled his little body in the quilt dejectedly, but as soon as his father left, he secretly followed after him. Silently standing outside his mom and dad’s big bedroom, his small head poked inside to steal a glance.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong turned his back and his eyebrows twisted, but he did not say anything.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao with her former beast intuition still intact, keenly sensed the little guy’s probing gaze. She looked towards the door and quickly saw the little steamed bun trying to hide his face.</p>
<p>“Oh, my baby has finished washing?”</p>
<p>She was currently lying like a sludge on a yoga mat placed next to the coffee table near the sofa, wearing a slightly tight, pink, short-sleeved shirt paired with a mint green colored, baggy short.</p>
<p>Lying on the matt, she was futilely trying to properly execute glute exercises to trim the excess fat on her stomach while strengthening her core.</p>
<p>But as she was moving her body leisurely, this only made Shen Yichong see her snow-white skin, as well her pair of slender and straight legs. Of which even the kneecaps are very small and looked delicate.</p>
<p>“Come here, baby. Come, exercise with mom.”</p>
<p>Just then, she made a bitter face, “I just ate one steak, and your Uncle Yi already said I had too much calories for dinner. So he asked mommy to do 90 minutes of exercise. Ah, this is torture!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong who was eavesdropping suddenly had a faint smirk on his face.</p>
<p>But then Shen Rui the steamed bun made a beeline towards the mat, and his little, fat, white body immediately rolled into a ball beside his mother.</p>
<p>“Okay, mommy. I’ll stay with you.”</p>
<p>The mother and son instantly did exercises together, lying on the ground in various poses, their buttocks raised in different angles.</p>
<p>Although their postures looked ridiculous and indecent, their bodies were very much in tune; despite the other body being larger than the other, they did the exercises in harmony, their bodies in tacit understanding.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong only stood unconsciously and watched this scene for a long time.</p>
<p>How many years did he last see Yu Yaoyao being intimate with their son? He couldn’t remember, simply because there really wasn’t an instance of it.</p>
<p>For a moment, he felt a strange feeling overcome his chest towards the woman in front of him, but his gaze was soon attracted by her sweaty, little face and pure smile.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao followed the video exercises dutifully, but she soon felt bored and tired; she only wanted to lie back on the mat and lie motionless for a long time.</p>
<p>But she knows that in order to be a beautiful actress, she needs to be fit and healthy!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao gnashed her teeth and said, “Baby, please help mommy count!”</p>
<p>Shen Rui the steamed bun nodded obediently, “Okay, mommy. One, two, one…”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Yu Yaoyao did two more moves before stopping altogether and frowning. “I can’t feel my legs anymore.”</p>
<p>She immediately laid back flat and started to contemplate.</p>
<p>“Mommy signed a contract on the set today and got 20,000 yuan for the TV show.” She then turned to the steamed bun and gushed, “Okay, baby! You count it like this: a TV play has one episode, then two and then another, multiply that and…oh!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was excited at the thought of her earnings and felt that her first rush of power was coming!</p>
