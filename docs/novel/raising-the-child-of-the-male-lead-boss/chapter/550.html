            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 210 – A Heartwarming Dinner (2)</strong></p>
<p>He had literally guided her step by step, just when had she managed to dump such a large amount of salt into the pan? The next second, however, the dreaded chopsticks loomed in front of his face again.</p>
<p>“Husband, eat a bit more~?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s temple throbbed with pain and he held her hand to stop her from advancing.</p>
<p>“Place the dish back on the stove, add some water or add another egg-”</p>
<p>“Nani?!” Yu Yaoyao clutched her heart, a look of despair wreathing her petite face.</p>
<p><em><strong>Gasp!</strong></em></p>
<p>“Husband, do you hate me so much?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you love me anymore?</p>
<p>“All other husbands eat their wives’ dishes and finish the bowls, say it’s tasty – Why do you despise me so?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “Be specific, tell me that person’s name.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted, but she made no move to make any modifications to the dish.</p>
<p><em>Doesn’t water cost money, too?! Adding another egg, does money grow on trees?</em></p>
<p>“Husband, please bear with my mediocre skills … I will make sure to practice and improve in the future! Q.Q”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong paused for a while and didn’t say anything. After all, it was her first time cooking in the kitchen, much less cooking for him.</p>
<p><em>It’s unpalatable … Let it stay unpalatable and agree to disagree. If she’s adamant about not fixing it, let her be.</em></p>
<p>When they eventually made their way to dinner, Shen Yichong, at last, noticed something amiss. When their son sat on the dinner table and put a napkin around his neck, Yu Yaoyao, who knows from where, brought out a cute children’s plate piled with scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>The little bun reluctantly picked up a spoon, visibly depressed. He was afraid of eating eggs this salty.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao whispered to him again. “Lil’ cub, this isn’t salty, mommy made it especially for you.”</p>
<p>She thought she had hushedly revealed the truth, but since she still had the small microphone around her neck, everyone heard the words clearly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who had just lifted his chopsticks, felt unwell all over. But he pricked his ears up and eavesdropped on the mother-son duo’s conversation, who were busy floating about in their own personal bubble.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after a while, their puzzled son questioned her: “Mommy, why~ ?” After a moment he added. “Daddy would also prefer to eat unsalted eggs, right?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows relaxed. Although his son usually harbored a mini grudge against him for stealing his mommy’s attention and was an incessantly brimming mini jar of vinegar, he still took his side at crucial times.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at Yu Yaoyao, waiting for her answer. In return, he heard her sigh.</p>
<p>“He has to eat salty eggs even if he doesn’t want to. Mommy, just like your father, has to eat unsalted eggs as well. Baby, we’re currently tight on money at home. We have to save money on food and get by a meal after meal, you know?”</p>
<p>The little bun blinked. Shen Yichong gaped at her in astonishment.</p>
<p>Still oblivious to her surroundings, Yu Yaoyao simply picked up her son’s fork and fed him a bite of the scrambled eggs. “Mommy and Daddy will make do with the salty eggs. With each bite of the eggs, we can swallow up to three bites of rice! The rice may not be as delicious as the side dishes, but it is filling and pads the stomach. What’s more, it’s cheaper than eggs.”</p>
<p>The little bun understood her implication immediately but still looked at Yu Yaoyao, distress apparent on his small face. He immediately noticed that in front of Mommy, who despised rice the most, was a bowl of rice piled up like a tor. It was over three times more than her usual intake.</p>
<p><em>Mommy used to adore vegetables and meat but rarely ate rice, especially more so at night. Turns out it is all to save money!</em></p>
<p>The little bun immediately glanced at the dinner plate placed in front of him: Scrambled egg, steak, and vegetables.</p>
<p><em>This is food that mommy took out of her own portion and saved for him!!!</em></p>
<p>“Mommy, give me some of your rice!” The little bun held out his pudgy little hands, pushing his scrambled eggs and steak towards her. “Daddy said boys should eat more rice. Mommy, you can have my side dishes, I don’t like scrambled eggs that much.”</p>
<p>“No need, Li’l Cub, eat it yourself. If I can see you grow up to be strong, tall, and healthy, as handsome as your father, that will be mommy’s greatest happiness.” Yu Yaoyao immediately waved her hand and refused.</p>
