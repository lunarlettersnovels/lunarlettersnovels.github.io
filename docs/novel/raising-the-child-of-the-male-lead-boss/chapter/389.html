<p><strong>Chapter 374</strong><u></u></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>The role of the teacher in the mountain area was what he’d been fighting to get for Ling Shuang at the time. He knew the director well, and he had worked with him before. Prior to this, he already felt that the theme and character personalities in the film had great potential.</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian was obviously more experienced than Ling Shuang in acting, and she had always been a low-key person. The judges were very likely to favor her.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>Even if she didn’t get the best actress award like Xu Hong had said, she could still hope to get best supporting actress. If this was the case, the comedy movie she would be starring in afterwards was definitely likely to become a Box Office miracle!</p>
<p>“How much is Guangxin going to invest?” he asked.</p>
<p>“This film is considered low-cost. We expect to invest 15 million Yuan, but it depends on the negotiation situation tomorrow. The director is Cheng Yibin, and the producer is Huanyu,” Xu Hong answered.</p>
<p>When Chen Jiao heard this, he relaxed his tense facial muscles, and for once felt that God was really on his side.</p>
<p>This was fate.</p>
<p>Cheng Yibin was a well-known comedy director of the new generation. Chen Jiao was considered to have a close relationship with him as they have worked together before.</p>
<p>Huanyu was also a producer that was known for his excellent production. He met one of the founders at a social dinner, and he felt that he had met him too late.</p>
<p>If he were to contact them, and worked with the Wansheng consortium, who asked him for internal information, they could definitely bid more than 15 million if they invested together.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had very good targets, and he almost only made money without losing any.</p>
<p>As long as he could get inside information about Shen Yichong, his investment would basically be stable.</p>
<p>“What about the other projects that you are considering investing in? Is there any script outline? Send them to me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll send all of them to you. Among them, President Shen values the “Emergency Time” project the most.” Xu Hong gritted his teeth and carefully shared the key information with Chen Jiao.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong was still at the company working overtime. He wanted to arrange the broadcast schedule and publicity plan of “Youth Without Regrets” for Yu Yaoyao. He had meetings with the entire marketing department, business department, and strategy department.</p>
<p>With her husband not at home, Yu Yaoyao called her best friend, Ren Sitong, to stay overnight.</p>
<p>The two of them were sitting on the white wool carpet, dressed in comfortable pajamas, chatting casually after they’d put the kids to bed. On the coffee table near them burnt a sweet, orange scented candle Ren Sitong had brought. They also had a goblet each, filled with low alcohol content champagne.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t really know how to drink, but Ren Sitong was teaching her.</p>
<p>“In the future, you’ll need to attend events for your movies, TV shows, or industry dinners. You will have to drink a little in such settings. Reporters are usually there on such occasions. If you don’t drink anything, they’ll say you’re too proud and that you don’t care about the others. But if you drink too much and vomit, they’ll say you’re depressed. Not to mention you’ll look terrible in the pictures,” Ren Sitong said, imparting important knowledge to her. “So, you have to practice. I didn’t understand this before. When my man changed from an actor to a behind-the-scenes director, he had to meet with investors, and eat and drink with the producers. Sometimes I also have to go with.”</p>
<p>“How inconvenient,” Yu Yaoyao remarked as she sipped her drink. When the alcohol touched her tongue, she frowned. She couldn’t understand what was so great about champagne. She lowered her goblet and said with a sigh, “Little Sisi, I’ve been so frustrated lately.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong laughed when she heard this, and stretched out a hand to touch her greasy little face, “What’s the matter, beauty? You are praised online for your acting skills, and the Box Office performance is great. Are you worried about the web drama that everyone is criticizing? It hasn’t even been broadcasted yet. Everyone is just blindly expressing their opinions. I don’t think you should worry about them!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pursed her lips and crossed her legs. “Not that. I have my husband and manager to worry about that for me. I put in a lot of effort; I’m not worried about that. It’s just that…” She blushed just thinking about what she was going to say. “It’s been almost half a year since I came back from ‘Wife’.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong had been there, and she understood what Yu Yaoyao meant before she’d even finished her sentence. “Oh, this is about you not being pregnant yet. Gosh, I thought it was something else. But why are you rushing? Haven’t you been on the crew since you came back?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao only looked even more upset at this.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Have the two of you been trying hard since your return? Mr. Shen was with you during that time?”</p>
<p>“Yes…” Yu Yaoyao nodded rapidly. “Although I was filming, we were basically together every day.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen does have a very good physique,” Ren Sitong said in surprise.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blushed. “Do you think something’s wrong with my body?”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong raised her eyebrows, “Are you filming tomorrow? If not, would you like me to take you to get checked out at the hospital tomorrow morning?” As she said this, her eyes lit up with excitement. “I also know an expert. She is really good! I finally had my first baby a year after I got married. She even counted all the times my husband and I had s*x.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes widened suddenly. “What? Something like that exists?”</p>
