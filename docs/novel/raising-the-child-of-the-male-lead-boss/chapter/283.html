            <p><strong>Chapter 480</strong></p>
<p>Dreams and reality were always so far away from each other. If you were not born with a golden spoon, most of the time you have to accept the harsh reality so you pursue your dreams.</p>
<p>If she couldn’t earn more royalties, she might have no choice but to go back to work.</p>
<p>“Before I met him?” Yaoyao replied, her face in contemplation. She came up with the answer in less than a second. “I wanted to be a star at that time. I thought I could do it and I liked it very much.”</p>
<p>She used to just watch, eat and drink, and she had never been exposed to other things. This was why her dreams were all pure and simple.</p>
<p>“As for talent…what is that?” Yu Yaoyao frowned.</p>
<p>“Um?” Fang Qiuye was stunned. “It’s… what you’re good at? Without it, you can’t succeed, you can’t be recognized, you can’t make money, and you can’t get ahead.”</p>
<p>“My, Big Head, why do you think about this? What’s important is that you’re happy.” Yu Yaoyao patted her shoulder. “I have lived for so long, but I’ve never seen many people who could make a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Her breeders used to frequently change… Even if they were talented, they were at most a senior breeder, and their pay was only raised by 2000 Yuan.</p>
<p>“Don’t you guys have a saying: ‘<em>There’s a champion in every field.’</em>?” Yaoyao sighed. “A shampion or a medalist – either way, there can only be one winner in each field.”</p>
<p>As Yu Yaoyao said that, she grabbed Fang Qiuye’s hand “Big Head, while it’s good for us to have dreams, but don’t be stupid! Why do you want to be the champion?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was stunned… Was that really the case? She always felt that something did not feel right.</p>
<p>“The same applies to me learning English. No matter how hard I try, I won’t be able to become the champion!” Yaoyao added with a laugh. She laid on the sofa with her feet stretched out. A relaxed expression was on her face. “But you should always find something worth doing for yourself, so that you won’t become a useless person!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye blinked, but she couldn’t refute it at all.</p>
<p>“Big head, what’s your job at the moment? Did you encounter difficulties?” Yaoyao continued.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye squeezed her hand tightly, “Well… I’m just writing, writing…”</p>
<p>“Ah… Are you a professional in writing compliments?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye: “…”</p>
<p>“Big Head, if you are short of money, I think you can set up a group for writing compliments. Every day, when someone loses their motivation, you can write them a compliment and charge them 2 Yuan each. Who knows, you might be able to get rich quick!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye: “…” It might be better if she just coded!</p>
<p>“By the way, Big Head, add me on WeChat.” Yu Yaoyao immediately sat up with her legs crossed. “I would also like to recommend a few ones I like to you. There are several books that I find very interesting.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was extremely embarrassed. In her stories, she would sometimes post the cover of her novels and a little about her coding life.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shen Dacheng is on-leave today and wouldn’t be updating?” Yu Yaoyao squeezed the pillow. “What? Noooooooooo, it just reached the climax yesterday….the female lead is about to…have s*x… with the male lead… How dare she ask for a leave today! Won’t her conscience hurt?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye felt that her soul was tortured and beaten. “<em>Dear</em>~ it’s not a leave of absence. It’s just that the update would be delayed until nine o’clock in the evening.” Her author’s tone and character accidentally shined through. After she finished speaking, her heart groaned.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Yu Yaoyao raised her head in doubt, “Huh, Big Head? You know that too? Did you see the author’s leave request?”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was sweating. Luckily, Yaoyao continued, “Oh, I know! You must have looked for novels when you got bored squatting in the toilet just now? Haha, I feel you, Big Head!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s heart trembled as Yu Yaoyao grabbed and shook her hand.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao’s torturous questioning session about the author was not over yet, “Oh my god! Shen Dacheng is going out for a meal again? Why doesn’t she do that at night? How dare she have lunch outside when she hasn’t even updated the novel… She doesn’t even save the manuscript, when she knows her speed is so slow! Gosh, I wish I could help her write it!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye was about to cry. She promised herself that she would lock herself in her room to do the writing. She would never chat with anyone online unless she had finished writing!</p>
<p>“No, she used to have a manuscript in the beginning, and something happened… In short, she doesn’t have it anymore.” Fang Qiuye mumbled. She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao rolled up her sleeves even more after hearing this. “She gave me so many false hopes before, and now she’s trying to delay the update…If she does it again this time, I would definitely teach her a lesson!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye trembled. False hope… well… that was her fault. Just when she was thinking about what to do, the phone in her pocket vibrated. She immediately glanced at it secretly and found that it was a WeChat message from Ye Yun. But she didn’t have the time to read it yet.</p>
<p>She secretly went to the comment section of her book. Since Yaoyao was so mad with it, she wondered if the other readers were also scolding her? She was shivering. After taking a glance at the comment section, she was shocked.</p>
<p>[YYY: Hello author, please update soon! Where is the sm*t scene I’ve been waiting for! If that doesn’t happen today, I expect it in the next update!]</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye, “…!”</p>
