            <p><strong>Chapter 377</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>The news about Yu Yaoyao’s second baby went from number 40 on the hot search, right to the very top.</p>
<p>The YY fans were more excited than anyone else:</p>
<p><em>[I knew it. Yesterday, I dreamt about her after re-watching the movie she starred in.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Aww… My baby Yaoyao? I will love her baby no matter if it’s a boy or a girl!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’ve been waiting for this day!!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I bet she wanted to keep her pregnancy a secret until she’s further along.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao, give me a hint in secret please. Blink your right eye if it’s real, and blink with the left if it isn’t!]</em></p>
<p>Some people carefully studied the recent photos of Yu Yaoyao appearing in public, hoping to find some clues. They even enlarged the recent photos of Yu Yaoyao to have a closer look at her belly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, everyone was a detective, and started posting their personal opinions and interpretations all over the Internet:</p>
<p><em>[The handsome blue trouser suit at the premiere of the movie “Chaos”: Well, it was to make the baby feel comfortable and warm. Our Yaoyao rarely wears an outfit that isn’t a tight, revealing dress!]</em></p>
<p><em>[The photo of her character in ‘Youth Without Regrets’: The fluffy skirt was just right to conceal her thickening waist.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The luxurious meal when Yaoyao was with the crew of ‘Year’: Mr. Shen has been preparing nutritious meals for Yaoyao, who was preparing for pregnancy at that time!]</em></p>
<p><em>[In the past two months, Yaoyao’s time spent on Weibo has decreased by 90% compared to before: She now has a baby. It’s time to quit the Internet and stay away from radiation!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Wei Ming and Lu Cheng both claimed that they shall learn from the dedicated Yaoyao: Sure enough, she is so dedicated to her job that she continues her shooting, even when she’s pregnant!]</em></p>
<p>With these interpretations, everyone believed what they read on the hot search even more.</p>
<p>Many were even calculating how long Yu Yaoyao had been pregnant, and when she was due. They really were acting like they’d received all the information they needed.</p>
<p>All of this gave Yu Yaoyao, who was reading the comments and discussions among the fans on Weibo, a terrible headache. The public opinion online was considered insignificant. What gave her more of a headache was that her friends had called, one after the another, or sent her text messages.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng even sent a ‘Congratulations’.</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian was frightened. He asked if she could still participate in the later recording of ‘Youth Without Regrets’.</p>
<p>Director Zhu Junfei was worried, so he sent her a message to check up on her. Since she would be filming a fight scene the next day, he asked if it was necessary for the screenwriter to change the script.</p>
<p>The artists that had worked with Yu Yaoyao before also came to verify the news.</p>
<p>From Wei Ming to Qi Hang, from Cai Fang to screenwriter Liu, even Zhou Zhuan, they all showed their gossiping potential and contacted her either through call or text.</p>
<p>After a dealing with another round of phone calls and text messages, Yu Yaoyao felt her cheeks burning red. She looked at Shen Yichong as if she was begging for help, “Darling, what should I do? I think… I did something wrong again.”</p>
<p>In fact, the photos of her in the hospital made her feel very confused.</p>
<p>She had purposely covered her face with a scarf and worn one of Shen Yichong’s loose coats, because she didn’t want to be recognized by the paparazzi! The coat had been so long that it had covered her ankles, not to mention her ample bust and curvy waist. But thanks to the paparazzi, the group of netizens were more certain about the ‘truth’ than ever.</p>
<p><em>[This coat belongs to Mr. Shen, I saw him wearing it before in ‘Wife’!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is her baby bump that big?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Oh my god! Is my baby already five months pregnant? That maternity dress made her look like she’s about to give birth, right?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Thinking back, our Yaoyao also kept covering her belly at the premiere…]</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s face burned even more. She had been hungry that day. She had only covered her stomach so that it wouldn’t growl. “Darling, shall I shed some light on this?” She pinched her little finger as she felt ashamed.</p>
<p>She didn’t expect that her unsuccessful attempt at cross-dressing would give people the wrong idea. Her plan had completely failed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed her head lightly. “Next time, let me know when you have plans. Today, we’ll clarify that you only went for a body check-up.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately covered her small face and glanced at the screen. “Will the fans be disappointed? Will they scold me?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong touched her face lovingly. “They were the ones who misunderstood the situation. The reporters were the ones who wrote nonsense without even verifying the news with us.”</p>
<p>But he saw that Yu Yaoyao’s face was full of melancholy and mixed emotions before he even finished speaking. He couldn’t help but laugh, “I’ll clarify it for you; you don’t have to worry about it. Just focus on your filming. The web drama will be broadcasted soon. We’ll be able to settle the rumors for a second time when they see your vigorous posture.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded pitifully.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong personally posted an announcement. He didn’t even get the public relations to draft it:</p>
<p><em>[ShenYichongV: Thank you all for your concern. We’ll personally share good news about us to the public, if there’s any. Also, @YuYaoyao’s ‘Youth Without Regrets’ will see you at 8 o’clock this Friday. We are currently filming the second half of the series. Any feedback is welcomed.]</em></p>
<p>As soon as this Weibo was published, it went onto the hot search. Unlike the previous celebration they’d had in the comments section, the fans were now wailing. They refused to accept what Shen Yichong had said.</p>
<p>They didn’t want to see the online drama, they wanted to see their second baby! Why was the world so cruel?</p>
<p>The ‘detectives’ had found so many hints of the second baby’s presence, but it turned out to be fake!</p>
<p>All the fans were in despair. Some of them even became extreme. They spammed the comment section saying that they would not watch any drama if Yu Yaoyao wasn’t carrying a second baby!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong ignored all of them. He didn’t even bother to turn off the comment function. He just let the fans comment whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was holding onto his arm, heaved a sigh of relief when she saw him posting the clarification on Weibo. She didn’t even care about the netizens and fans that said they won’t watch her show. “Darling, are there any new scripts for me to play? There’s not much filming left for ‘Youth’.” Yu Yaoyao shook Shen Yichong’s arm lightly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squinted. “Don’t you need a break?”</p>
