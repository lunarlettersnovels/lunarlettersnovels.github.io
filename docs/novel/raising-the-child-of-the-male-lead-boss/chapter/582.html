            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 172 – Questionable Actress (2)</strong></p>
<p>But who would have thought that Zhao Xiaomeng would give her a pack of small spicy sticks as soon as she saw her backstage? She hadn’t eaten this type of food, but she had heard of it and really wanted to taste it.</p>
<p>And since she couldn’t hold back anymore, she immediately ate it after finishing the challenge. Sure enough, after taking the first bite, her delicate little face changed color! The spiciness of the food was terrific.</p>
<p><em>It’s spicy… but delicious!</em></p>
<p>This was a natural, salty, and powerful taste that she had never tasted before. She sat silently on the stool and ate the pack of spicy strips, chewing slowly and slowly, cherishing every bite in her mouth. Finally, she sizzled after eating, and fanned her mouth with her hand; the netizens and the audience thought she was cute and adorable.</p>
<p>They continued watching her eat the spicy strips, making them drool and admire her even more. In an instant, many decided to order that particular junk food online! Even the little bun, who looked at his Mommy, almost drooled.</p>
<p>He glanced at his father, knowing that he would not agree with him, his only option right now was to watch his Mommy eating the snack, imagining himself eating it.</p>
<p>Despite the spiciness and salivating moment, the host officially announced the start of the second round of the competition. Although it was the second round, there was no tension or nervousness inside the auditorium. It could be that Yu Yaoyao had made the judges shed some of their sternness, changing it into calmness.</p>
<p>Not a moment later, Chen Jiao approached Director Zhou Qiu and whispered a few words. Soon, Zhou Qiu nodded and grabbed the microphone.</p>
<p>“In this round, we will start with Yu Yaoyao first. This just makes everyone’s waiting time equal.”</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, none of the judges made any objections.  But Shen Yichong frowned and looked towards the jury panel, his cold eyes fell on Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>“Okay, then please ask Yu Yaoyao in Room 12 to get ready. The topic for this challenge will be announced shortly.”</p>
<p>The big screen immediately displayed the screen that was in her room.</p>
<p>She was still wiping her mouth with a tissue trying to throw out the garbage packed with the remaining small spicy strips when she was suddenly stunned by the roll call.</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, the screen on her little room lit up. A line appeared, a very… long topic, and the text completely filled the entire screen!</p>
<p>The studio audience, as well as the people watching the live broadcast, knew the topic beforehand. Everything was set before they called Yu Yaoyao’s attention who was waiting inside the room and put the topic on the screen.</p>
<p>Director Zhou Qiu picked up an old notebook on the table and let one of the audiences sitting behind him open any page he wished.  He then smiled, took the notebook back, and held the opened page before the camera.</p>
<p>“None of the contestants in the little black room can hear this paragraph I’m talking about now, right?”</p>
<p>The host then bent and replied. “The rooms are soundproof.”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu looked satisfied, upon hearing his response.</p>
<p>“I heard from the program director that many netizens are questioning the fairness of this show.”</p>
<p>“This matter is not part of my responsibility, but I saw a comment saying that the judges received money from a certain boss and that they were paid to make sure that this artist ends up in the first place,”   he said, glancing at people inside the auditorium.</p>
<p>The audience suddenly smiled and looked at the direction the judge was looking at, as of the moment.  Holding his son, Shen Yichong, instantly became the focus of everyone’s attention. His somewhat indifferent face turned very determined this time and he nodded towards Zhou Qiu with respect.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu smiled at him in return and waved.</p>
<p>“Therefore I want to prove my innocence and I will testify that Boss Shen is innocent as well.  I don’t know if this program has been covering some shady parts, but today, everyone will definitely see it.”</p>
<p>“This notebook has all the clips I’ve jotted down since the day I started this profession. I’ve just invited a random audience to open any page he likes and will use whatever is written on this page as the topic for the contestants’ challenge.” With that, he began to read.</p>
<p>The writing on the notebook was also flashed on the big screen for everyone to see.</p>
<p>“Coincidentally, this is also a tearjerker drama.” As Zhou Qiu looked at it, his smile was wider than before.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the word ‘tearjerker’, the audience exploded in anger.</p>
<p><em>She was used to crying scenes. Yu Yaoyao cried so quickly in the previous challenge. Shedding tears, how difficult is it for her? This is the problem with this show!</em></p>
<p>Zhou Qiu didn’t seem to be bothered by the commotion inside and continued to read from the book in his hand.</p>
<p>“She was drinking, first sip and still sober, second tipsy, third drunk, tears were already in her eyes. There’s tears in her eyes but they did not flow… fourth, with tears in her eyes, one slowly slipped, with pain and hatred and regret, falling down along the cheek… ”</p>
<p>“With the fifth sip, her eyes were scorching, sighing deeply at the injustice of heaven. Although her face was not old, her heart was already cold.”</p>
<p>Everyone could see that on a small screen, the words that he read were typed for the presentation later on. They could also see that beside the stage, the stenographer was rapidly typing on the keyboard.</p>
<p>After reading the entire topic, people thought that the idea was not bad. And the text that appeared on Yu Yaoyao’s screen was the same as what the director read earlier.</p>
<p>Soon, the auditorium plunged into silence! The comment section in the live broadcast was suddenly still. But in a moment, bigger waves broke out!</p>
<p><strong>[F*ck! Am I on the wrong show! Is this poetry or acting?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I can’t believe it. I can’t believe it. I can’t believe it. Can anyone perform?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Such a blessing, Zhou Qiu, what drama is this? I can’t wait for this fairy drama!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Playing out of the ordinary, huh? What a show!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Sister Y, yeah, don’t wipe your mouth anymore… come out and play that scene quickly.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I said it before, well not really, the judges are fair!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Awesome, if Yu Yaoyao can perform that, I will buy one hundred bags of potato chips she endorses and will eat all of it!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Brace yourself! You will witness a large-scale face-slapping scene! Boom!]</strong></p>
