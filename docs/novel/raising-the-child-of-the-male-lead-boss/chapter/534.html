            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 228 – The Heroine’s Whereabouts (1)</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong cast his eyes at his son’s drawing that was hanging from the dining room’s wall. He tried to process what Yu Yaoyao just told him. He wanted to make sure that he heard her correctly, then laid his eyes back on Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>She was holding a newspaper in her hand, and her gaze towards him was intense as if she caught him in bed with a stranger, and so he instantly went through his schedule for that day in his head to calm himself.</p>
<p>There weren’t many female artists in his company, and he always kept a distance from them, so he doesn’t know why his wife would suspect him.</p>
<p>Even the nature of his position would not normally require him nor give him opportunities to meet any artist of their company alone.</p>
<p>Even if an artist of theirs had some issues he needed to be involved in and resolve, he would never meet them alone. Such an instance would require the whole crisis management team sitting together and not just him. They would meet and try to fix the problem together with the artist.</p>
<p>“Where did you get that idea?” He asked her while raising his eyebrows.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao however continued to look at him with unwavering eyes, then she turned to look back at the newspaper, “Do you know a girl called Ling Shuang?” As she was talking, she bent down and held his chin with her hand and lifted it up slightly.</p>
<p>“Look at my eyes, honey and answer me straight.” She told him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, and he answered without any hesitation, “I don’t know her.” But he raised his eyebrows at her and added, “This name is a little familiar, though.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao whined, and covered up her face, “You…you already know her? Do you like her? No wonder you could just leave me on the bed last night, and went to the company for Chen Jiao….”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned, “I just heard her name somewhere.”</p>
<p>He pressed his temple, and soon he recalled. He searched through the trending list on Weibo which he saw this morning again. There was one entry on the list that suddenly emerged as the most trending search for that morning.</p>
<p><em><strong># Chen Jiao terminated the contract, and picked up a mysterious girl #</strong></em></p>
<p>This entry buried almost all the other news, including the ones about Yu Yaoyao and the questioning towards Chen Jiao. At first glance at the headline, it looked like someone paid for this tabloid entry, in order to cover up all the public opinions that were against Chen Jiao.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of people scolding him on the internet. There was a new comment on the articles, someone claimed that this girl was Ling Shuang, who graduated first in her class at the Film Academy of that year.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong finally found the name his wife was alluding to, he then handed over the phone to Yu Yaoyao and said, “I just read it this morning.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao bulged her cheeks and looked at the news again, there was even a photo on Weibo! As soon as she saw the photo, she glanced at Shen Yichong quickly, then looked carefully at this post again.</p>
<p><em><strong># Chen Jiao showed up at the entrance of the Film Academy this morning, looking intimate with this young girl, talking and laughing, like a couple. #</strong></em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted, “They’re not a couple, it’s his little sister.” She told him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at her, slightly raised his eyebrows, “You went through all the comments already?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao shook her head subconsciously, but she seemed to have changed her mind halfway and instead gave him a nod. Of course, she didn’t read through all of the comments. Just perhaps, most of it. She knew he had a sister because she read the whole book.</p>
<p>This Ling Shuang left her a very deep impression, she reminded her of no less than Yu Xinjie whom she hated the most. Ling Shuang, she was exactly the main heroine of the book, and the one God chose would snatch her husband!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was surprised to see this name in the headline when reading the entertainment section this morning, so she came to ask Shen Yichong about it. According to the original plot in the book, the heroine didn’t show up until the body of Yu Yaoyao’s character was drowned in sleeping pills.</p>
<p>“She is signing up for Chen Jiao’s company, so don’t think much about it.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took away the phone together with the newspaper in her hand, and led her to sit on the dining chair. He poured her a glass of milk. Yu Yaoyao stared at him.</p>
