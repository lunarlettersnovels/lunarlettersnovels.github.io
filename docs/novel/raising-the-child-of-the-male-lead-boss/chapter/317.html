        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 446</strong></p>
<p>As a boss, he was responsible for the future of a group of people. He needed to be responsible for each artist and plan for them. Only then did he discover that his way of looking at problems had changed.</p>
<p>He clearly realized that the resources in the industry were limited. Assuming that the total number of national resources was 100, and his studio could only get 5 of them, then his ten artists will not be able to share it equally. Other than the distribution of talents, there were always preferences and biases.</p>
<p>In the early days, when the company itself was not strong enough, there were always artists under its umbrella who could not get enough of what he or she deserved. Shen Yichong used to gather a lot of company resources just to support himself. He had been too short-sighted; only looking at himself.</p>
<p>“In business, there are always gains and losses.” Shen Yichong pinched out the still-burning cigarette in the ashtray. “You need the right mindset. No one can win from the start to finish. Similarly, failure is only temporary.”</p>
<p>“I respected your choice when you chose to leave. When I first found you, I already told you that the entertainment industry might not be able to give you anything else other than money. It may not be a good place to stay,” he continued.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao could only smile wryly. Shen Yichong was truly a qualified… no, an <em>excellent</em> businessman. He has a clear distinction between public and private affairs. Sometimes, he was like a precise machine.</p>
<p>Other bosses might still play the emotional card, but he doesn’t do it at all. For so many years, except for the accidental marriage with Yu Yaoyao, he had clearly distinguished between work and personal relationships at other times. The artists under Guangxin, except for those who have been in the company for a long time like him, have probably not even chatted with Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao couldn’t help but feel depressed for a while, “In addition to making money, Mr. Shen, have you not considered anything else?”</p>
<p>If Shen Yichong had regarded him as a brother for those few years, he wouldn’t have left Guangxin decisively in the end. If Shen Yichong was willing to talk to him and analyze the pros and cons, he wouldn’t have insisted on setting up his own studio to find a better way out.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao looked at Shen Yichong with a trace of resentment and anger. In the end, he was the one that was criticized as the ungrateful one. However, Shen Yichong had regarded him only as a company artist. He was nothing more than an investment!</p>
<p>In business, there are gains and losses… He was just a business of Guangxin!</p>
<p>Chen Jiao clenched his fists. But as soon as his voice fell, he met Shen Yichong’s deep, dark eyes. Although Chen Jiao had been accustomed to his cold eyes a long time ago, they still shocked him.</p>
<p>“Ah, Jiao, I should be the one to ask you this. Right?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao shook.</p>
<p>“Do you still remember your award-winning work — how did you get to the eyes of the public at that time?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong took away the lighter on his table, turned around, and was about to walk out of the room. But he stopped, turned his head, and gave him an indecipherable look.</p>
<p>“I still have the same advice. Do what you should do and don’t compete with me. Must you get hurt to learn?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s whole face was pale. As expected, Shen Yichong knew everything. Shen Yichong knew all the dirty tricks he did behind his back, and he knew he was totally defeated… It was impossible to defeat Shen Yichong!</p>
<p>His award-winning work at the time… Chen Jiao can clearly remember the classic lines of that character with just a little recollection. His character looked outgoing on the outside, but he was suffering from serious mental illness, similar to the so-called second personality.</p>
<p>Everyone thought that he was happy and positive, but no one knew that he actually had communication difficulties and was extremely bad at expressing. But in order to make his friends feel happy when they were together,  he forced himself to speak over and over again to liven up the atmosphere and make it not awkward.</p>
<p>But when he would lock himself up as soon as he got home. The more he talked during the day, the more pain he felt at night. But from beginning to end, no one except the psychologist knew his pain. No one can empathize with his experience.</p>
<p>Before acting, Chen Jiao talked to the director. He believed that the role of this film was set to express this kind of social problem. The social pressure of modern people, and the necessity to please others. But the director said no. Even some professional film critics also gave a high-level interpretation of this film, which was – Don’t think that you know someone, and don’t define someone before you get close to them.</p>
<p>‘Maybe the friends of Xiaozhi all wanted him to act as someone who could cheer up the atmosphere every time? ’</p>
<p>‘Maybe, he had a friend who actually wanted to express, but he had to suffer every time because Xiaozhi always snatched the chance away?”</p>
<p>Xiaozhi was the protagonist of the film, the role he played at that time.</p>
<p>‘How would you know the joy of fish if you’re not a fish?’ This was the interpretation the director told him.</p>
<p>And what did Shen Yichong say just now!? Chen Jiao was shaking.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was saying that he had never restricted him, and nor did he define him subjectively. And that was for his own sake? To him, He did not seem to be humane, but he had given himself the greatest space for development… and he had never forced him?</p>
<p>“Wait!” Chen Jiao suddenly roared as he strode out the room to chase Shen Yichong. “Shen Yichong!”</p>
<p>“You are not me! How do you know that all I want is freedom!” Chen Jiao roared in pain! He didn’t care if the program group was still being recorded.</p>
<p>What he wanted… what… what could it be?</p>
<p>The moment he exclaimed out, what Yu Yaoyao said back then came to his ears again. What he liked was neither her, nor Ling Shuang, but the feeling of being noticed and cared about. There was someone to praise him even when he failed. What he wanted was never freedom!</p>
<p>But… praise!?</p>
<p>The corners of Chen Jiao’s mouth twitched strangely. For a moment, he felt that his heart was severely struck by thunder as he looked at the back of Shen Yichong who had stopped in front of him.</p>
