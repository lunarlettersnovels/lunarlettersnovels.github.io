            <p><strong>Chapter 457</strong></p>
<p>As Ye Yun looked at Yaoyao who came down the stairs, she had the magical solemn feeling of being at the Cannes Film Festival and watching a movie star walk the red carpet. Even though Yaoyao was wearing home clothes and was even sweating a little, Ye Yun, as a woman, also felt that she would be picturesque no matter where she went.</p>
<p>Neither thin nor fat, she had a figure that was just right. Even when she was wearing funny and cute pajamas, her originally slender and tall figure could still be seen. Ye Yun couldn’t help but be shocked when she saw her pinkish face and long neck up close.</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry I’m dressed like this,” Yu Yaoyao said, feeling a little embarrassed to see Ye Yun staring at her so intently.</p>
<p>She should have practiced in yoga clothes, but she changed into dinosaur clothes in order to have a family shot with Shen Rui and his little sister. After doing yoga only she remembered that she should have changed it. But decided against it since she felt lazy.</p>
<p>Ye Yun, however, didn’t find it embarrassing at all. She couldn’t find anything to scrutinize at all since she was both nervous and excited.</p>
<p>“Are you Xiao Yunyun who came to help me with ideas for variety shows?” Yu Yaoyao walked down the stairs and quickly came over to say hello.</p>
<p>Ye Yun, who finally came back to her senses, found that she hasn’t answered since Yu Yaoyao came.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am,” she said, trying to be professional. “… Sister Yao*, it is nice meeting you. I look forward to working with you in the future.”</p>
<p><em>*Literal text is Da Yao. Da means big/older. For easier reading, we will use ‘sister’ instead.</em></p>
<p>She immediately reached her hand towards Yu Yaoyao, her heart pounding in her chest.</p>
<p>“Sister Yao? Well, that’s a good name, you can just call me that. No one at home calls me that.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pulled down the zipper of her dinosaur suit and loosened it a little before she stretched out to hold Ye Yun’s hand. After holding it, she shook it heavily, just like what Ye Yun had seen on TV.</p>
<p>“I look forward to working with you too,” she replied.</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s legs softened. Yaoyao was holding her! Her hand felt so tender, soft, and warm!</p>
<p>This was her idol in the flesh! A goddess!</p>
<p>“Auntie, didn’t you want to pee?” Little Bun raised his head and looked strangely at Ye Yun, who seemed to have lost all direction and forgot what she was going to do after shaking hands with Yu Yaoyao. Ye Yun almost jumped up.</p>
<p>“Ah, right!”</p>
<p>She almost forgot after feeling so ecstatic!</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Ye Yun came out of the bathroom, her expression was a little uncontrollable.</p>
<p>She had just met Yaoyao and Little Bun, and she even touched Little Bun’s tail. Just now, she even used Yaoyao’s toilet… The same toilet seat as her, the same toilet paper. The sanitary napkins in the toilet were also the brand she had always used! She even made a close observation just now. She found that Yaoyao turned out to be really approachable.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, she felt closer to her idol. Today, she felt like she was on cloud nine! So lucky! Ye Yun was so happy.</p>
<p>When she got to the living room, she immediately greeted Yaoyao and Little Bun solemnly again. She seriously introduced the reason why she was here and her future position in Guangxin.</p>
<p>But she concealed her identity of being a fan. She didn’t mean to hide it, but she felt a sense of shame.</p>
<p><em>‘I’m a big fan of yours. I watched every movie and variety show that you were in, and I would even scream after watching them… Also, I’m the vice president of your fan club…’</em></p>
<p>Ye Yun was too embarrassed to say it.</p>
<p>But in the next second, Yu Yaoyao enthusiastically pulled her arm towards the sofa. “Xiao Yunyun, have a seat. I heard that you are one of my top fans?”</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s face immediately turned red! When was this exposed? Mr. Shen must have told her in advance!</p>
<p>But… the title sounded quite cool?</p>
<p>Ye Yun couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.</p>
<p>“Actually, I haven’t had much work recently, so I feel I’m using another person for an easy task by making you come help me,” Yu Yaoyao interrupted her thoughts. “It’s mainly about my variety show, you know?”</p>
<p>Ye Yun immediately nodded frantically. Of course, that was something a top fan must know. “‘Welcome to my Home’?”</p>
<p>“Yup.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately told Ye Yun what happened and what Shen Yichong told her. “All in all, the program team is facing some problems because of me. We need to find a way to solve the problem for Director Zhao.”</p>
<p>As soon as Ye Yun heard this, she became energized, and her eyes immediately shone brightly. Looking at Yaoyao who was sitting on the sofa like an ancient concubine, she felt that the responsibility on her shoulders was very heavy!</p>
<p>Yaoyao was a nice person. She was so kind and responsible. As her fan… a top fan, she must help her fulfil her wish, and let more people know her beauty.</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s brain cells started working quickly!</p>
<p>Given that Yaoyao was unable to attend the show, it was inevitable that the revenue of the variety show would decline. As a senior fan of Yu Yaoyao, she had also watched every episode of the variety show, and she more or less had some memory about the broadcast data.</p>
<p>In the last episode, if it weren’t for the grudge between Chen Jiao and Guangxin, the audience would have declined. Mr. Shen was too serious, and Little Bun lost interest in everything when he was not by his mommy’s side. Fans might be able to endure it once or twice, but the father and son wouldn’t be able to maintain the attention of the audience if they kept doing this.</p>
<p>And since Yaoyao was still breastfeeding, it was very likely that Little Sweetheart would have no milk to drink if she went out for work. And if Yaoyao felt tired, her immune system would weaken, and she would catch a cold, etc.., which could directly affect Little Sweetheart’s health.</p>
