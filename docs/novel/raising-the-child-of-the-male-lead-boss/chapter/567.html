            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 190 – Matters of the Heart (2)</strong></p>
<p>He guessed that Yu Yaoyao was still stuck in that area of the scene. Although he was ashamed of sharing stuff, he tried his best to bring out his first love story, hoping to let her find the feeling of a girl falling in love and finish this scene smoothly.</p>
<p>However, after he finished speaking, Yu Yaoyao was even more surprised.</p>
<p>“Why does your heart beat faster when you like her?” she asked her assistant. “My heart only beats faster whenever I eat.” She added.</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “…”</p>
<p>He just gave her a helpless look.</p>
<p>“Sister, there will always be someone special to you. Think about the boss …” But before he could finish his words, Yu Yaoyao let out a cry again.</p>
<p>“Because she is willing to sit at the same table with you, that’s why you like her? Is human love that easy?”</p>
<p>A dumbfounded Ni Yi did not know what to say. But soon, he gathered himself and asked her a question.</p>
<p>“Sister, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was really curious.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it like TV dramas? The male lead saves the female lead and almost dies in the process. Yet the female lead didn’t even shed a single tear! She only realizes that she loves him when the male lead is dead! It’s so hard to fall in love. Why does an erratic heartbeat equate to love? Isn’t that too simple?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi almost fainted at her unfathomable words.</p>
<p>“Sister, why do you have so many questions now? The heartbeat is instantaneous, after getting along through time, after knowing each other and understanding what that person truly is to you, it becomes love.”</p>
<p>This time it was Yu Yaoyao’s turn to be flabbergasted!</p>
<p>Her outlook towards life, no, at least only her perspective of love was wholly subverted. It turned out that her understanding of what love was was wrong from the very beginning.</p>
<p><em>Am I wrong? </em></p>
<p>“So, TV dramas are lying to me?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi was really convinced. “Sister, you are an actor. Didn’t you cry in the finals of ‘In the Limelight’? But if you’re crying at that time because that’s what you saw on TV, the audience would think that you’re just acting and showing a dead emotion!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s jaw fell.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ni Yi ferociously glared at her. Wow, he’d just stumbled upon a terrible secret! His sister doesn’t love Boss Shen at all! Otherwise, how could she not understand temptation and love at all!</p>
<p>“Sister, if you have any questions, come and ask me, don’t ask others.” Ni Yi wiped his cold sweat as he spoke.</p>
<p>“What else don’t you understand? Temptation? Do you want me to search for a video about temptation or how about a person with temptation in his eyes…?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stared blankly in the air. Right! She thought about when she first got her mobile phone and installed a bunch of entertainment video apps that were recommended. For a long time, she’d regarded watching dramas as a textbook on learning how to be a person.</p>
<p>She thought that the dramas performed by humans are naturally the closest to human life. <em>But why..</em>. what she thought was right turned out to be wrong? She couldn’t accept it for a while.</p>
<p>But soon, her attention was gradually caught by Ni Yi’s soft murmuring.</p>
<p>“If you leave this person, you will miss him.”</p>
<p>“If you are separated for a long time, you will feel that you are missing something, and you will feel like you have lost something. Making you want to go back immediately to see him.”</p>
<p>“Moreover, getting compliments from someone you treasure alone feels more satisfying than getting praised by the whole world.”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Yu Yaoyao froze.</p>
<p>She left home early today and had breakfast in the car. Furthermore, she was wondering why she was missing Shen Yichong a little. Also, if she didn’t want to go to the set, he’d said that she could just go home anytime and he would cook her meals…</p>
<p>Well, if she did not do well, he would educate her, but if she did well… he would praise her! He also brought her a delicious feast!</p>
<p>Ni Yi made her lose her weight, but Shen Yichong made her freshly squeezed juice, taught her how to eat oysters, and told her that paella was very delicious…</p>
<p><em>Whoops…</em></p>
<p>“Sister, what’s wrong with you!” Ni Yi watched Yu Yaoyao in horror as her red lips were quivering, her beautiful eyes welled up with tears.</p>
<p>“Ni Yi, I somewhat feel sad in my heart right now. I seem to be thinking a little about Shen Yichong. I want to …” Yu Yaoyao stopped midway and raised her puzzled little face.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what she wanted. She was clearly not thirsty or hungry now. She had finished her breakfast, and the lunch was already set by the crew. But… she left him and she felt like she was missing something!</p>
