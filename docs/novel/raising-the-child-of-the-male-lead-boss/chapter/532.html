            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 230 – The Heroine’s Whereabouts (3)</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong really was amused at her imagination; he didn’t know where she got all those crazy ideas.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame that you’re not a screenwriter, your plots are catching up with Screenwriter Liu’s.” He teased her and pinched her cheeks and smiled. “I never drink in the office, nor do I put alcohol in there.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her eyebrows at him. <em>He had no alcohol?</em></p>
<p>She blinked. Then… next time she would bring some alcohol over, so they could play on the desk with red wine~</p>
<p>Hee, and on a rainy day! They would Hear the thunder and lightning outside, and she would strip this man naked, and then, pushed him down on the desk~</p>
<p>Perfect!</p>
<p>“You have a commercial to film this morning, and are going to the drama crew at night, eat some more.” Shen Yichong scooped her some salad and placed it on her plate, and then looked at his watch.</p>
<p>“Um,” Speaking of this, Yu Yaoyao frowned, “The director also said, that today we’ll shoot the scene jumping off the building, so I should eat more and save some energy. Hopefully we only need to do it once when we start at dusk.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s hand with the butter paused, “How high is that rooftop, did Ni Yi ask the prop crew?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao shivered at recalling its height, “He said it’s more than five meters tall, I’ll ask the director about the details in the afternoon. If it’s not enough… then we’ll need to increase it.”</p>
<p>“Tell Ni Yi to check the safety. Forget it, I’ll tell him myself.” Shen Yichong put down the butter knife and started to dial the number in his phone.</p>
<p>The scene jumping off the building was a part that many actors needed to go through at least once in their careers. This kind of scene was relatively less in ancient palace dramas, but was more common when there were fighting scenes, for example, in some martial arts or police and criminal dramas. Scenes involved in falling from a high altitude, sometimes were done by stunt men and women, but they were also personally done by the actors themselves.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned a bit, took a look at Yu Yaoyao’s tender little hands and blurted out, “Use a substitute if it’s too difficult. I’ll talk to Director Zhou.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao sighed, “It’s okay.”</p>
<p>She searched online and read an article about how to become the best actress last night. After all, she just told a bunch of reporters that she would win the best actress, so she did some research on the way home. She found out that, there was a common note in the experience of many actresses—that no matter what scene it was, they don’t use a substitute, they do it themselves. She decided she would do the same. Back then, Director Li didn’t agree with her on using a substitute for the snake scene.</p>
<p>“I can do it, it’s just jumping down, isn’t it? Just five meters, I remember I used to climb on the tree….”</p>
<p>“You’ve climbed a tree?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows, looked at his wife who always said she was so tired after just standing for a while.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao coughed, “When I was a kid, when I was a kid….”</p>
<p>Shortly, Ni Yi and the assistant came to pick her up and brought her to the studio.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong specially reminded Ni Yi about the safety issues, and asked him to give him a message once the shooting time in the afternoon was confirmed.</p>
<p>“I have a meeting today, but I’ll try to get to the crew before meal time. I’ll take you to a nice meal as a reward for your jumping scene,” Shen Yichong told her as he escorted her to the car.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was about to tell him to be frugal, but was interrupted.</p>
<p>“Listen to the director when you’re in the crew, and you must confirm with the staff about the safety before you start the scene. Don’t rush, be conscious of your standing position, jumping movement, and your angle entering the camera, communicate everything with the director first, and when everything is set, then jump on the safety mat in one go.”</p>
<p>“When you go down, remember your butt on the ground, and don’t use your hands….” Shen Yichong kept talking as they were walking towards the car.</p>
<p>Ni Yi listened to him on the side, wiping his sweats away. All his lines were finished by his boss, such a spoiled wife she was.</p>
