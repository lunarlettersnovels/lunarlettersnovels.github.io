<p>“So, he probably just had to leave,” she added as she shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>The reporters’ mouths were hanging wide open after hearing her words.</p>
<p>Then Yu Yaoyao started talking again, her arms were waving in wide gestures as she spoke, “As for what would happen to Guangxin now that he left, I think there won’t be any changes, really.”</p>
<p>“Don’t we have one best actor and one best actress every year? We might not have one right now, but we’ll have one soon.” Yu Yaoyao finished.</p>
<p>She answered very well.</p>
<p>Even Chen Lin after hearing her bravely speak her mind appreciated and admired her! To be honest, Chen Lin used to think that his boss’s wife was only an eye candy, the kind that hardly did any work and would only drag others down when they do something stupid. But unexpectedly, she spoke in front of the media today quite properly. He also read her posts on Weibo, and firmly believed that Guangxin would definitely be better with this lady!</p>
<p>“Madam Shen is very confident, are you feeling confident about yourself?” One of the reporters asked.</p>
<p>“Last time you performed on the same stage with Chen Jiao, do you think that your acting skills are better than him?”</p>
<p>“If you have a chance, what would you say to Chen Jiao?” The reporter threw sharp questions at her.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned, and was about to pick up the microphone and answer for her, for if Yu Yaoyao was not careful enough about this question, and showed even just slight arrogance, she would definitely be attacked by Chen Jiao’s fans.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao grabbed the microphone quickly before him, even glanced at Shen Yichong, and bit her lips.</p>
<p>“I am…of course confident about myself.” Yu Yaoyao replied. “I believe in what I’m capable of, but Chen Jiao was the best actor, which doesn’t conflict with the best actress that I’m going for. There’s no need to compare between us,” she quickly added.</p>
<p>This was certainly a clever answer. Even Shen Yichong squeezed her hand under the table, that small gesture was to inform her of how well she responded.</p>
<p>But his admiration quickly disappeared the next second, Yu Yaoyao pouted her lips and began speaking again.</p>
<p>“I have nothing to say to him. We didn’t have much contact, and I don’t really know him. But if I have to say one word to him… then I just want to say…. Brother, Chen Jiao, could you please not announce your termination in the middle of the night?” Yu Yaoyao sighed when she said this.</p>
<p>“Being single is an illness, and it needs to be cured. If you don’t have s*x life in the night, that’s fine, but don’t interrupt other couple’s se—” Before she finished her sentence, Shen Yichong quickly took away her microphone with an embarrassed expression.</p>
<p>Chen Lin was soaked in cold sweat and stepped forward hurriedly.</p>
<p>“The interview is dismissed.”</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao was unstoppable, she managed to grab the microphone and circled her hands around it then placed her mouth near to it.</p>
<p>“Chen Jiao, stop making big announcements late at night next time! Why did you make such a scene in the middle of the night! If you can’t fall asleep after dinner, do some push-ups at home!”</p>
<p>The reporters were all shocked with her pronouncements! The flashes lit up like crazy once again, and they instantly started to write!</p>
<p>Now they got new headlines!</p>
<p><strong># Madam Shen got mad about Chen Jiao’s announcement late at night, interrupting her nighttime engagement! #</strong></p>
<p><strong># Madam Shen has declared: no news at night! #</strong></p>
<p><strong># Madam Shen: Irritated at late-night activities being interrupted! #</strong></p>
<p><strong>The next morning, YY fans went crazy once again!</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 For some reason, I really want to laugh although I know this was supposed to be a sad news. 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 Madam Y, you’re making me laugh always~ 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 Such a hilarious cutie making me laugh every minute~ 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 Woman, you really draw my attention this time! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 She’s so real, I’m now her fan! 】</strong></p>
<p>The number of Yu Yaoyao’s followers strangely increased again! After such a dumbfounding interview, the self-assured answers of this couple raised the public’s questioning of Chen Jiao’s reputation to the climax.</p>
<p>But something else drew Yu Yaoyao attention after getting out of bed the next day. She took the newspaper and went to Shen Yichong who was eating breakfast at that time.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? I thought you have a jewelry commercial to shoot in the morning, why are you still here?” Shen Yichong asked her when saw her coming at him when she should have left.</p>
<p>She stood in front of him in silence, but after a few seconds, Yu Yaoyao blinked at him and her eyes were watery.</p>
<p>“Honey, will you cheat on me?” She suddenly asked and Shen Yichong choked on a piece of egg that got stuck in his throat.</p>
