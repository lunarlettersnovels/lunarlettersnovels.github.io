            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 53 – A Mom’s Gentle Hands </strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao has never bathed children before. In fact, she had just recently learned to take a shower as a human being in this new life. Care products such as body wash, shampoo, facial cleanser, conditioners and even hair masks were new to her, and she found out there actually variants depending on age,</p>
<p>Therefore, she first did her research on the internet on how to bathe babies.</p>
<p>She took her tablet to the bathroom, and while she was browsing, she took some notes diligently.</p>
<p>‘<em>First, the water temperature should be controlled to at around 37 ℃ to 40 ℃. You can’t put the baby when the water is too cold, and if the temperature is too high, the water should be allowed to cool first.</em></p>
<p><em>Let the baby first put down his foot in the bathtub to get used to the water temperature. Lukewarm water should be used in bathing. There is also no need to use mild, liquid bath soap every day. Once a week or two is preferable.’</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao looked at the steps carefully and read them out.</p>
<p>Shen Rui the steamed bun’s face immediately became red as his two small hands reached to cover his exposed small buttocks.</p>
<p>He peeked at the screen and saw that his mommy had searched on how to bathe year old children!</p>
<p>Those babies didn’t look anything like him! After all, he’s already five years old!</p>
<p>The steamed bun suddenly became embarrassed, but he had never once remembered his mommy giving him a bath as a baby. So instead of telling her that she was searching for the wrong info, he looked at the babies on the screen silently together with his mother.</p>
<p>Well, anyways—whenever Shen Rui is with his mommy, he’s still her baby.</p>
<p><em>That’s right! </em>He nodded.</p>
<p>“Come here, little Ruirui. Raise your hands and let mom take off your shirt for you.”</p>
<p>Shen Rui gently bowed his small head, the two white and tender, little fat arms, raised obediently to the air. Then, Yu Yaoyao carefully took the baby’s clothes off. In the end the small body was like a little naked cherub.</p>
<p>Afterward, the steamed bun dropped his arms, but they quickly clung to his mother’s dress as she reached out seriously to feel the water temperature. When she found it satisfactory, she held one small feet of the steamed bun to lightly touch the water’s surface.</p>
<p>“Is it hot or cold? Or does the baby find it all right?” She asked in a loving, motherly tone full of concern.</p>
<p>Shen Rui the steamed bun really liked this soft voice; after a while, he gently bowed his head to tell her it was just right.</p>
<p><em>Mommy’s warm voice is really different from dad’s deep voice.</em></p>
<p>When her mother spoke, it’s as if a soft, fragrant wind was blowing towards him, making him extremely peaceful and contented. As if there were rainbows in his heart!</p>
<p>He pursed his lips and forced himself to hold back from smiling widely.</p>
<p>After she got his consent, Yu Yaoyao placed him in the bathtub full of lukewarm water and took a small towel and wet it with some liquid soap. She dutifully wiped his little face and hands clean before proceeding to wash his little body.</p>
<p>Sitting in the bathtub being taken care of by his mother, Shen Rui feels as if he is on cloud nine.</p>
<p>His mommy’s movements are very light. While watching the video and scrubbing him, he felt as if her every movement was treating him as a fragile baby.</p>
<p>It turns out that being bathed by a mom is such a blissful experience!</p>
<p>In comparison, his dad would only casually wipe him, not at all fastidious as his mommy!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who did not know that he was being secretly badmouthed by his son, stood outside the bathroom. At one point, he was even surprised to hear a video of a baby’s bath tutorial being played inside.</p>
<p>Ever since Shen Rui was born, he hasn’t seen Yu Yaoyao this attentive before.</p>
<p>“Shen Lin,” After listening for a while, he went outside and dialed his assistant</p>
<p>“Place an order on the top selling, limited edition ladies’ handbag on the market this year.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Two days later, Ni Yi came half an hour early to pick up Yu Yaoyao at the Shen villa.</p>
<p>He halted as soon as he entered the door.</p>
<p>A bleary-looking Yu Yaoyao was wearing a pink, onesie pajama, a long dinosaur tail dragging behind her as she walked.</p>
<p>And the young master Shen Rui, who held her hand, was also wearing a miniature version of her dinosaur onesie in the color yellow. On his little head was a small hat with dragon horns and teeth. The dinosaur tail behind his onesie was a little longer than his legs that it would drag across the floor when he walked, so he carried the dragon’s tail in his small hand to remedy this.</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes, yawning, and his little voice greeted Ni Yi with a sluggish ‘good morning’.</p>
<p><em>So cute! </em>Ni Yi’s uncle heart was immediately moved!</p>
