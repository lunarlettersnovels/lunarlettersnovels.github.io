            <p><strong>Chapter 318 – Defeated (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Many people on the internet suddenly became the next Conan and Holmes. After they’d seen the comment made by ‘Bro is a Slave for Wife’ their thoughts immediately jumped to one person; a married man known as Mr. Shen whose wife was a very popular actress.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his wife was currently filming in a city that matched the exact location. She also drank herbal tea and pear juice and was suspected to have some type of discomfort in her throat… Adding in the label that said man was a slave to his wife, the possible candidates were reduced to a limited number of people.</p>
<p>The comments started flying:</p>
<p><em>[Damn! It’s Mr. Shen! It’s my sister Y’s Mr. Shen!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Oh my God, it was my fault. I should have thought about it. There is no one else besides our Yaoyao who would need labels written on whatever she eats and drinks!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Shit! The commenter really exposed the truth! The label on the small glutinous rice dumpling, ‘Only give when hungry, and one at a time…’ Hahahaha! Isn’t that written to prevent the food-loving Yaoyao from eating too much?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Shocking! I knew Mr. Shen was always a slave to his wife, but I didn’t know it was to this extent!]</em></p>
<p><em>[So many drinks and sparkling waters for our Yaoyao… Besides her three main meals, there are still so many small snacks for her… Is this for real?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Does Mr. Shen want to feed our sister Y into a fat woman?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Y’all, you put your focus in the wrong direction. Our Yaoyao has been depressed lately, she really needed more sweet tasting foods. Mr. Shen is the best husband. And that is the truth!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is it only me who wants to cry? The love between these two… it’s so touching! They would never leave each other, and they support each other through difficult times.]</em></p>
<p>The Y and ‘wife’ fans were all as happy as children. They felt they had found out a great truth about their treasured CP*.</p>
<p><em>*Internet slang for ‘Couple’.</em></p>
<p>Soon, Yu Yaoyao received a phone call of apology from her hairstylist “Teacher Yu, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mention you when I sent it to my friends, but the truth was still found out on the Internet… I’m truly sorry!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao only found out about the story after she had finished eating half a chicken. She immediately comforted the hairstylist, “Well, my fans are smarter than most, just like me. It’s okay, just be more careful next time when you send a message!”</p>
<p>This also went to show that her husband was different from everyone else, stood out and was recognizable.</p>
<p>After she had finished the call, she let Shen Yichong know that he had been exposed on the Internet. Fan of How Wife, Fan of Feeding, Rogue Who Bathes His Wife, Doraemon… Now, he had become a Slave for His Wife who wanted to make her fatter.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao daintily held the chicken bones, hung up the phone, and kissed Shen Yichong’s tense face with her oily mouth, “Darling, everyone is praising you! And they are jealous of me,” she sucked happily on the bone, unable to throw it away.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong lovingly squeezed her soft cheeks, “As long as you are happy. You can drink one more bowl of soup at most, and no more after that. Otherwise, you won’t be able to digest it during the night. I’ll go to work for a while, and you can rest after eating. Shen Rui will come back a little later today. His teacher took the class to an extracurricular activity.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded obediently like her son, “Okay.”</p>
<p>While she was casually lying on the sofa, enjoying the blessings of the chicken bones and scrolling on her Weibo, the Yu family was being publicly interviewed by a reporter. They repented to the reporters, and they apologized to Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Zhao Mei didn’t look like an elegant lady anymore. Her long hair was messy, her clothes were creased, her wrinkled face was red and swollen, and her forehead was covered with a gauze. Zhao Mei’s head was pressed between Yu Jianghai’s hands as she confessed her crime to the reporters and public.</p>
<p>After dinner, all the servants in the family were fired by Yu Jianghai. His thoughts were very clear. The reputation of the Yu family was destroyed, and their son-in-law, Shen Yichong wouldn’t protect them anymore.  It was also impossible for his daughter, Yu Yaoyao, to come and verify that the bloodsucking deeds were all rumors. It meant someone else had to bear the blame.</p>
<p>Yu Jianghai’s youngest daughter, Yu Xinjie, would marry someone in the future, no matter what. At least she still had a future. His own company had to continue to operate, and his reputation as a boss would need to be maintained.</p>
<p>Only Zhao Mei, the woman who wasn’t even being productive at home, would affect him with her bad reputation. He would only be said to have a terrible taste in women. No matter how hard he tried to solve the problem, the only resolution was to have Zhao Mei take all the blame.</p>
<p>Zhao Mei wept. She realized that her husband was indifferent as was her biological daughter, Yu Xinjie, who never offered a thought or word from the beginning to the end. Ultimately, Zhao Mei could only burst into tears and confess her mistake to the reports.</p>
<p>In a very soft voice she said, “I did that. I was me all along. It’s because…. I am her stepmother. I am jealous of Yaoyao’s biological mother. I didn’t want Yu Yaoyao to enjoy what she had. I wanted my own daughter to have the best. I was blinded by this, and I did the most shameful things,” as she spoke, her face reddened. She felt so shameful that she wanted to dig a hole and away forever.</p>
<p>The reporter asked to have the analysis quickly verified by several netizens.</p>
<p>With gritted teeth, Zhao Mei looked at her stoic daughter, Yu Xinjie, and the fierce Yu Jianghai. She couldn’t help but cry even harder.</p>
<p>Yu Jianghai threatened her with a divorce, but if she was willing to admit to her crimes and take the blame for all her past mistakes, part of her pre-marital property would be given to her. If not, she wouldn’t even get a cent after the divorce.</p>
<p>“No, it wasn’t Little Jie who did it. It was me!” Zhao Mei screamed out as she cried, “All the branded stuff Little Jie bought was bought by me using Yaoyao’s card. I bought everything for my daughter!”</p>
<p>Zhao Mei was Yu Jianghai’s second marriage. Before marrying her, he had cleverly notarized the property in advance. After his marriage, his company didn’t make any money. In the past ten years, he could only afford to buy her some bags and jewelry. But they were all worthless if they were to be resold in the future. She would get nothing if she had a divorce.</p>
<p>The reason behind why she was so greedy and wanted to take all of what Yu Yaoyao had was because she was insecure. It wasn’t until today that she finally realized she was the one abandoned by the family. Although she had planned so much and done so much for the family, she was kicked out the moment she became worthless.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t just leave without getting a cent…</p>
