            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 116 – Rare Pampering</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong came over and, ignoring his son’s protests, he picked him up and placed him on the ground. He remained calm in the face of his son’s blistering stare.</p>
<p>“Let your mother get up so she can get ready and eat breakfast.”</p>
<p>He also ignored Yu Yaoyao, who was acting lazy as if she was boneless, and slipped back into the to lay down again. He went near her, grabbed ahold of her waist and lifted her quickly from the sheets.</p>
<p>“If you want to go to the program today, I will accompany you,” he said. Then, a hint of darkness flashed across his phoenix eyes, “This time, no one will be able to say anything against you or dares to attack you. But if you want to rest for now, then don’t work, but  you have to get up and eat.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao recognized the rare care in his tone as she peered at him with astonished eyes. She wanted nothing but to collapse into his arms. But then she looked at the little bun standing on one side, curiously looking at the both of them.</p>
<p>She sighed and decided not to harm the flowers of motherhood.</p>
<p>Instead, in a place where the little bun couldn’t see, she sneakily stretched out a hand and touched Shen Yichong’s thick thigh muscles and laughed cheekily.</p>
<p>“All right, I’m up!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s back turned stiff. He immediately had a damn reaction!</p>
<p>While Yu Yaoyao was caught red-handed, she immediately ran away with the pink Chanel outfit in her hands, the slender legs all exposed under his T-shirt. Her dark curls that ran to her waist vaguely drew the curve outline of her body…</p>
<p>“Dad, you have another nosebleed!” Shen Rui, the little bun, stared at him with big eyes.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched and covered his nose as his face darkened.</p>
<p>“Go and drink your porridge!”</p>
<p>The little bun stuck out his tongue at him. Holding the big, white plushie, he rushed into the bathroom and said, “Mommy, dad has another nosebleed! I’ll be the one to accompany you to work today! Dad is useless!”</p>
<p>Only a bell-like giggle reverberated from in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>After a hearty breakfast, the three members of the family got in the car.</p>
<p>Although Shen Rui, the little bun, had some reluctance, in the end, they dropped him off his kindergarten. Yu Yaoyao said goodbye to him through the glass as Shen Yichong personally escorted his son out of the car and sent him to the park.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to the set.” Shen Yichong came back and told Chen Lin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ni Yi was sitting in the back seat, and he excitedly broadcasted Yu Yaoyao’s rising fans.</p>
<p>“Elder sister, your fans have risen to 600,000! Wow, 610,000! 620…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was lying on the back seat, resting directly on the little bun’s big snake plushie. She then stretched out a hand to amuse the two snakes next to her that made the men cringe.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t the most powerful artist break through a billion fans?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s voice halted immediately. His elder sister’s ambition is <em>not</em> grand at all!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong cast his look at the backseat, and his phoenix eyes dimmed. Taking off his windbreaker, he hurriedly threw it to the back seat.</p>
<p>“Cover yourself.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was lying down without care for her image and donning the plaid skirt; her legs stretched out in the back seat. Although the glass was unidirectional and the inside of the car couldn’t be seen from outside, a frown still crossed his face.</p>
<p>Ni Yi quickly took it and put it on for her.</p>
<p>But then, his neck and back felt cold, as if some murderous look were circling him. He took a small glance back and saw the Shen boss’s cold eyes of death focused on him.</p>
<p>Ni Yi trembled and quickly sat in the front row.</p>
<p>How special does he think he is, no, how brazen was he to dare to be attentive to the madam in front of the Shen boss?!</p>
<p>“A personal assistant was dismissed yesterday. For today, I’d like to see three more!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at him as Ni Yi wiped his sweat.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>
<p>The next time anything happens to his sister, it will be his turn to die!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When they arrived at the set for the program, their car had just stopped when they saw Meng Xinran and her agent standing outside in despair. Shen Yichong didn’t speak and directly gave Chen Lin a look.</p>
<p>Chen Lin understood and, after getting off the car, gave the two people the ultimatum from the boss.</p>
<p>“Go back to the company first and wait for news. Don’t go against the boss. Otherwise, we will deal with it according to a breach of contract.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran immediately cried out, her feet almost collapsing to the ground. Her hands pulled at the car’s door as she begged, “Boss, I’m not a malicious person; I didn’t want to hurt your wife… I was wrong, I admit it… If anything, please don’t hide me, I still have many activities…”</p>
<p>Her agent had a sour face as he tried to hold her back, but soon, the door opened by Shen Yichong blocked her.</p>
