            <p><strong>Chapter 323 – Experiencing Life Together (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>“How many years can we protect him?” she continued. “There is a saying that if you give a man a fish, he eats for a day, but if you teach him how to fish, he eats for a lifetime. We should establish a sense of self-preservation in our child from an early age; to stay with the army and police, and never be alone, to not take things from strangers on the road, and to not go home with strangers,” as Yu Yaoyao said this, the baby nodded his little head. “Of course, the baby does not have the ability to protect himself. We should hire bodyguards and have him practice taekwondo or something like that. Right?”</p>
<p>Almost as soon as she’d finished her sentence, Shen Rui blurted out, “Right.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had a headache. He stretched out his hand and pinched his eyebrows. “The three families who participated in ‘My Wife and I’ did not let their children appear on camera except for us. Shen Rui, Dad told you that it’s not a good thing to broadcast your life to people too early. Now, in the kindergarten that Dad has you go to, you and the children get along peacefully, but if you go on TV every day and all the children see you, will it still be like that?”</p>
<p>Red-eyed, Shen Rui grasped his mother’s clothes again, “If Mommy can, so can I. If Dad can, so can… so can I,” his voice cut off and he had to croak out, “Dad…” Then suddenly, he thought of something.</p>
<p>He crawled out of Yu Yaoyao’s arms, ran to his small room, and took out his tablet. He showed the pudding advertisement to Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong only glanced at it and then sighed. There was another child in the advertisement who Yu Yaoyao kissed. He suddenly understood the child’s thoughts.</p>
<p>Seeing his father look away, Shen Rui quickly took up Yu Yaoyao’s script again. In the show, Woman 1 and Woman 2 both had children, “Dad, everyone else can, and so can I,” he said nervously, hesitantly. “I’m not afraid. You said that I am manly. I must be brave and solve problems when I have them. I cannot run away.”</p>
<p>This time, it was Yu Yaoyao’s turn to nod desperately.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned, and finally, he raised his hand towards Ni Yi, “Give me the scripts for the TV shows and movies.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi quickly presented them up.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong flipped through each in turn and took the variety show announcement that the baby was holding. The paper was crumpled and wet with the child’s tears. Shen Yichong was not a forward-thinking person, but since he was forced to be, he had to make up his mind and fully prepare himself. He finished reading quickly. He came to a conclusion.</p>
<p>“’Welcome to My House’ can be picked up, but communicate to Director Zhao that it will not take place in the fixed villa. It will be shot in second and third tier cities, new rural areas, mountains, plateaus… Since I have to bring my child into it, it should be a show that is educational and positive,” Shen Yichong said, “That way we can take our child to experience different scenery, and we can also allow the audience to see the living conditions of different classes from all over the world. But our family has to do it all by ourselves, abandoning our existing wealth, and presenting an ordinary life,” Shen Yichong decided.</p>
<p>As soon as Ni Yi heard this, his small eyes lit up and he took out a notebook to record what was being said.</p>
<p>Even Yu Yaoyao’s eyes lit up, “Husband, you are so smart! Are you saying that we will take our child and pretend to be poor together?”</p>
<p>The little baby looked up at Mommy and Dad blankly. He didn’t understand everything, but he understood the words, “take our child” and “together!” He felt a well of excitement. His eyes were watery and red from crying, but the tears quickly disappeared. “Thank you, Dad!” he said excitedly. “I will try to pretend to be poor! I won’t say that my family is rich! I won’t eat meat; I will only eat rice!” his mind wondered back to the days when his father was bankrupt.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched, “We won’t… pretend to be poor. This is called experiencing life.” He felt helpless, but he still tenderly touched his son’s head, “Since we are going together, Dad hopes that you can experience more life and see different scenery. Your mother and I don’t need money and don’t need a child to make money on TV. But since you insist on doing this, Dad hopes that you will remember this experience later, and it will be your life’s treasure, rather than a regret.”</p>
<p>When Shen Rui heard this, he blushed from embarrassment, but even more so from excitement.</p>
<p>He could really be on TV with his mother!</p>
<p>Dad had agreed!</p>
<p>He had wrongly blamed Dad. Dad was not stingy, Dad was super!</p>
<p>“Dad!” the little baby stretched out his hand from Yu Yaoyao’s arms and reached toward Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s serious face seemed to be blown to warmth by a spring breeze that made him seem as though he were about to melt. He leaned over towards his son.</p>
<p>Warmth flowed between father and son. Communication between men. At that moment, the whole room was flooded with love and warmth. Since Yu Yaoyao cared for her child, her son had almost never willingly given up his mother’s embrace for his father. This time the child was relieved, and it made him fall in love with his father again.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was satisfied with the result as hugged his son and patted his little butt, but he didn’t expect the warmth to only last for a second. In the next moment, his son’s body moved away reluctantly, and his little hand patted Shen Yichong’s shoulder as a sign to release him. Shen Rui immediately turned around and returned to Yu Yaoyao’s embrace.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was speechless. He pressed his fingers to his temples and turned to Ni Yi, “Now, make it clear to Director Zhao that if we participate, we must postpone the recording and broadcasting time of this show. Half a year after ‘My Wife and I.’ Our family will temporarily return to a peaceful life of filming and going to school. We don’t need to overexpose during this period. If Director Zhao is okay with it, we will talk about the follow-up.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi nodded rapidly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong also turned and patted Yu Yaoyao’s delicate hand, “During this period, you should quiet down and complete at least two scenes with the film crew. Later, let’s see if you have any favorite scripts and we will pick up a high-quality job. After all, you are an actress.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao reckoned this was okay, “Okay, husband. I will listen to you.”</p>
<p>“And don’t go on Weibo as much,” Shen Yichong rubbed his eyebrows as he said this.</p>
<p>“Huh, does it affect you? ​​Alright…” Yu Yaoyao answered regretfully. On the Internet, there were more and more girls going after her husband.</p>
<p>Quite suddenly, the little baby’s chubby arms hugged her shoulders in distress and comforted her, “Thank you, Mommy… Mommy worked hard… Mommy, I really love you… Tonight, Rui Rui wants to sleep with Mommy.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed his lips into a silent, thin line. His heart hurt watching them.</p>
