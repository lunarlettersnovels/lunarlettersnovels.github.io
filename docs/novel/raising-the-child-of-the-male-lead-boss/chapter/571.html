            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 185 – Ravenous Husband (1)</strong></p>
<p>Instantly, the contraction in his belly made him realize he <em>wanted </em>it, his breathing became hot and gradually thicker. He had thought that his emotions had subsided because of grief and anger, and that he would never forget the promise he made to himself… to never believe and love a woman again…</p>
<p>However, in this moment, it seemed that her actions had awakened his hunger, driving away all doubts, disappointments, and indifference from the past… there was something that screamed inside his head, yelling to breakthrough without any reasons, and do something stupid.</p>
<p>He wanted to touch her; he wanted to <em>feel</em> her.</p>
<p>And as he unconsciously leaned over her body, he stretched out his large arms and clasped her… then, he gently stroked her smooth back, and slowly pulled down the cold metal zipper.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was suddenly relieved, and a comfortable sigh escaped her plump, red lips. Shen Yichong’s eyes turned ravenous. His scorching eyes unconsciously focused on her shiny red lips as if it were dipped in honey.</p>
<p>The half-asleep Yu Yaoyao suddenly felt a somewhat hot entity in her abdomen, making her uncomfortable once again. It seemed she was about to be crushed by some behemoth! She twisted her very uncomfortable body, with a sour expression, stretched out her slender arms, and gently laid it on the man’s neck.</p>
<p>Reflexively, Shen Yichong stiffened at her actions.</p>
<p>However, the next moment, Yu Yaoyao was already attracted to the mint smell wafting from his body. Her only thought was that there might be something delicious hidden somewhere in this man’s body, making him so delectable!</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but narrow the distance between them and devour him!</p>
<p>For a moment, she was confused as to why it’s not nearing her. So she lifted her small face, while her mouth was drooling… her warm and soft lips touched his cold thin lips.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was stunned. He couldn’t believe it! His mind immediately went blank, the heat he was feeling worsened!</p>
<p>The fragrance of her whole body surrounded him, like the sweetest liquor eroding his sanity. She even stuck out her pink tongue and tasted every corner of his mouth as if she were tasting something delicious.</p>
<p>After licking it heedfully, she squinted a little and hissed again between his lips.</p>
<p>With that, Shen Yichong’s final chance to maintain his composure immediately crumbled. He reached out to her, vigorously held the back of her head, deepening the shallow kiss!</p>
<p>She didn’t resist at all, and her nimble, rosy, tongue entangled with his. Soon, her sweet fragrance instantly penetrated his entire being, sending warmth all over his body.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Outside, after the housekeeper returned to her room Lao Zheng and the other photographers lurked inside the villa.</p>
<p>When they’d arrived, they hadn’t captured anything worthy. They couldn’t go back empty-handed. The director would surely be furious.</p>
<p>Lao Zheng’s mind was messed up, he decided to analyze their situation first before finalizing; he stood listening outside the room of the couple. However, a delicate sound was heard outside.</p>
<p>Camera team: “!!!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing the sounds, Lao Zheng hurriedly whisper-yelled. “Hurry up and go away, we need not hear this private matter!”</p>
<p><em>The young couple is so in love that they’re unable to hold back their passions! We will be dead if President Shen gets to know that we’re in front of their room!</em> Lao Zheng thought.</p>
<p>Inside the room, as of this moment, Yu Yaoyao who was unknowingly sucking her husband’s lips soon moved back and took a deep breath realizing that there was no delicious lobster or mint-flavored food in her dream. Then, she woke up.</p>
<p>When she opened her groggy eyes, she saw a vague figure, bending over and presumed that it was an entity who would eat her alive.</p>
<p>Her little mouth was bitten by him.</p>
<p><em>Ow!</em> She was startled!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed her back on the bed and kissed her fiercely as if he had endured years in a desert. But soon, he felt that the woman who was lying on the bed was struggling!</p>
<p>When she slightly regained her strength, she immediately bound her legs together and used her two little hands to block the chest of the man that was facing her right now. With flushed cheeks and watery eyes, Yu Yaoyao pulled out her mouth from his.</p>
<p>“Wow, ah, ah, go away! Please… don’t eat me… No!”</p>
<p>“I don’t taste good. I am covered with bones… not much meat… ahh… ahh, I’m not as meaty as a big lobster nor as delicious and savory as a drumstick!” Yu Yaoyao swiftly retreated and her head slammed onto the headboard!</p>
<p>She knew humans ate snakes! She had seen it from the online videos at the zoo!</p>
<p>Roasted, fried, and even stripped snakeskin and snake soups too that were usually paired with wine.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao thought of it and felt like crying. But as she touched her body and felt her curves and soft chest, she realized that she was now a human being! She was no longer a snake living in the zoo!</p>
<p><em>Will I be eaten?</em> She thought.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong, on the other hand, who was pushed away by her, was stunned.</p>
<p><em>Is she still resisting me? Was she just dreaming of other men?</em></p>
<p>His face suddenly turned cold. Everything turned out to be a mistake. He immediately got off the bed.</p>
<p>“Okay,” he said without any emotion.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, clutching her hands immediately jumped out of the bed feeling relieved when she heard his familiar voice.</p>
<p>“Husband…?”</p>
<p>It just happened that she woke up and didn’t see him clearly. Now, she found out that it was Shen Yichong who was gobbling her mouth earlier!</p>
<p><em>Was that the cold-hearted husband who just kissed me? Eh?! At last, he couldn’t hold himself any longer and was captivated by my charm!</em></p>
<p>But Shen Yichong, who was standing at the head of the bed, coldly gazed at her from head all the way along her body. Eventually tried to reach out and touch her once again.</p>
<p>But his eyes flashed at the sudden realization of his actions, he immediately withdrew his hand.</p>
<p>“You sleep here, I will stay in the study.”</p>
<p>He knew he’d crossed the line. It was foolish of him to do that to her!</p>
<p>According to the agreement, they only need to maintain the image of the husband and wife in front of the public.</p>
<p>He tightly pressed his lips, turned around, intending to walk towards the door. But just after taking a step, a sound came from behind him, and then a soft body rammed directly on his back.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt the body sinking from his back, then a pair of smooth and soft white arms hooked around his neck, strangling him… they fell on the carpeted floor!</p>
