            <p><strong>Chapter 371</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>The night after Yu Yaoyao attended the premiere, she was once again on the hot search. The fact that her casual, handsome outfit hadn’t stolen the spotlight from the actresses, but from the actor, made all the fans laugh.</p>
<p>While the fans were excited to see her, they had also begun to worry about the quality of her future work. Originally, Yu Yaoyao’s fans were content, because they realized that their Yu Yaoyao would have infinite potential no matter what work environment she was placed in. Despite being the wife of a rich man, she was able to gather fans from many different backgrounds, all on her own. She’d risen as a star from being an absolute nobody.</p>
<p>But now, fans were starting to have higher standards and requirements as her reputation, performance, and professionalism improved. The fans all felt the gap, especially when the publicity of ‘Youth Without Regrets’ came out. Compared to her character, Sheng Ji, in the well-produced blockbuster ‘Chaos’, her girly character in the youth drama disappointed her fans a little.</p>
<p>Many of them even read the original novel the play was based on. After that, they started complaining even more about the story line, as well as the old-fashioned heroine setting:</p>
<p><em>[God! Is our Yaoyao’s manager so bad at his job? This script is terrible!]</em></p>
<p><em>[After watching Sheng Ji’s performance on the big screen, I really didn’t want my husband to pick this up. The small screen is a waste of my husband’s acting skills and beauty!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Although this is the prize from ‘Stage’, I don’t think people expected my Yaoyao to improve this fast! This script is no longer in line with my sis’s ability!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Where’s Mr. Shen? I beg Mr. Shen to show up and find a good script and role for my Yu Yaoyao! She should be taking the high-end jobs; the silly school drama isn’t enough!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I think my sis could totally be the best actress if she could get a good role! I burst into tears after watching Sheng Ji. She looked so beautiful; even in her moments of despair!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Sigh… Just let some someone else play the web drama. Let my husband focus on the big screen! Otherwise, she’s going to end up accepting more work like “Wife”. Compared to these boring online dramas, I still prefer watching my husband’s daily life!]</em></p>
<p>The Internet quickly became flooded with comments.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao saw everyone’s opinions and complaints. It was the first time her fans were criticizing her work. She had always been casual about her profession. She was never eager for quick success, and she had never minded not raking in roles from large blockbuster movies.</p>
<p>Without first discussing it with Ni Yi, she posted on Weibo:</p>
<p><em>[YuYaoyaoV: Each role allows me to experience a different life. I find it very enjoyable. The heroine of “Youth Without Regrets” is very cute, and it’s a style I like. In addition, I and the screenwriter @XiaoxiaoXiang had discussed the plot and character lines many times before. Our entire crew is working hard on this, and I hope it will also remind everyone of the little joys of reading novels.]</em></p>
<p>Seeing that she’d came out to speak for the show herself, Director Zhu Junfei, the producer, and the female screenwriter who had just graduated from university all felt very grateful. They quickly jumped to support her post:</p>
<p>Shen Yichong also personally reposted his wife’s Weibo.</p>
<p><em>[Support.]</em></p>
<p>He even called the producer and coordinated the broadcast time of the web drama. Originally, it was scheduled to be broadcasted a month after the filming was over. But now, he proposed to broadcast two episodes a week: with the premiere being the following month.</p>
<p>The whole play would undergo filming, editing and broadcasting simultaneously.</p>
<p>“Won’t this be too rushed? Our publicity work hasn’t been spread out, and the current heat is not enough. Moreover, several online platforms now have their own main dramas, and the best  timeslots on weekend nights are currently held by popular shows,” the head producer said in concern. “Will the editing team even be able to keep up? In addition, if the online feedback is not good, Teacher Yu will have to shoot under pressure.”</p>
<p>But not only Yu Yaoyao, the new niche actor, Qiu Dacheng, was also likely be pressured by the public opinion. With this, Director Zhu Junfei was even more likely to become a nervous wreck.</p>
<p>Once the first two episodes were broadcasted, and if they got negative comments from the public, the spirit of the entire crew would be affected.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong had confidence in his wife. “It won’t be that bad. This drama is going to do very well.”</p>
<p>Every day he went to set to watch the filming. Although he was a simple man who was not interested in romance-themed novels, he witnessed Yu Yaoyao’s serious attitude in regards to her performance, as well as the spark between her and Qiu Dacheng when they interacted. He was confident that the results would be good,</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao also suggested some bridges that would shock the viewers. This could increase the possibility that the play would surprise the public in a good way.</p>
<p>His instinct told him that the producer’s worries were all for nothing.</p>
<p>Even if this web drama wasn’t a phenomenon, it would still stand out in a crowd of youth dramas and give him a huge return on his investment.</p>
<p>“Filming and publicity are not a problem. If the editing falls behind, we will increase the manpower. I can make additional investments.” As long as one was willing to spend money, advertising wasn’t a problem. “Currently, the fans’ doubts are good exposure. I think we should surprise everyone with a reply. We shouldn’t run away from this.”</p>
<p>From the producer’s viewpoint, Shen Yichong’s decision was simply an act to show off his wealth and unconditional support for his wife.</p>
