            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 141 – </strong> <strong>The Baby Wants a Family Picture (2)</strong></p>
<p>Then, Shen Yichong soon realized that he had been completely forgotten by the duo.</p>
<p>He shook his head and reached for the door to find Assistant Chen. As he was about to close the door, he heard Yu Yaoyao’s shriek from inside.</p>
<p>“Baby Rui, oh! We forgot to include your dad.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched as he heard his wife. When he was about to walk into the living room, he paused as he saw Chen Lin approaching and waved, a gesture for them to leave. He opened the door once again and entered the room.</p>
<p>But soon after, he heard a naïve voice answer.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, mommy. We will just take daddy’s picture later.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was utterly astonished as he heard his child. Yu Yaoyao, on the other hand, was completely enlightened by little bun’s words for she was fully aware of what the outcome should Shen Yichong be included in the selfies.</p>
<p>“Ah, is this okay? Anyway, you’re right. Your father would wear the same poker face every day.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong heard Yu Yaoyao justifying to the child. He was flabbergasted by the impression they had of him. He furrowed his brows deeply in indignation.</p>
<p>He was mightily provoked now. He immediately chalked out his retaliation and doled out instructions.</p>
<p>“Chen Lin, order a family photoshoot. I want the best,” Shen Yichong said in an overbearing tone.</p>
<p>Chen Lin was puzzled over the turn of events. However, the sight of his boss’s gloomy face prevented him from thinking further. He nodded immediately.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong looked at the door and took a deep breath before going into the living room and picking a pack of cigarettes.</p>
<p>“Go to the balcony, you are yet to give me a report on this month’s investment project. Also, for the next shareholders meeting, we will discuss the divestment of the movie “Fallen City”. Remember that.”</p>
<p>Chen Lin quivered. “Boss, we have invested 10 million…”</p>
<p>Holding a cigarette between his lips, he pulled out a lighter and lowered his head to light it.</p>
<p>“I have watched a scene, the leading actor is not good enough.”</p>
<p>Chen Lin breathed a sigh of relief. “The actor has issues in personal life and was banned. The director’s group is already auditioning people for the role. I’ve heard that veteran movie stars are also very interested in the role.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong puffed out a smoke ring and squinted. “It’s not the actor, the character’s writing lacks conviction and internal growth as a whole.”</p>
<p>Chen Lin exclaimed. “Eh? But boss, this is this year’s blockbuster drama, which has a fantasy theme, is rare in the film industry. It is also a great guide to join in. Both the Finance Department and the shareholders are very optimistic. ”</p>
<p>“Is Dadao not capable of going wrong?” Shen Yichong retorted.</p>
<p>“Ahh…” Chen Lin muttered, unable to answer his boss.</p>
<p><em>The next day…</em></p>
<p>Shen Rui woke up early in the morning and grabbed the tablet that took many photos yesterday. Little bun hugged the tablet close to his chest as if it were a treasure. There seemed to be a tiny determination on that innocent face, the same kind when one is reluctant to lose something one likes.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s deep thoughts were suddenly shattered by a small movement. He touched his son’s head, his chest surged with softness and pain at the same time.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… son.”</p>
<p>The limpid, black orbs of the little bun were suddenly a little dazed. As if shocked, he lifted the round head and looked at his father.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong squatted down. “In the future, if you are unhappy, just tell your father.” He quickly lifted his hand and patted the little bun’s head. “Matters among men are settled in a manly way.”</p>
<p>Little bun froze and soon after he raised the corners of his mouth. He kept his head low and let out a long grunt like an old animal.</p>
<p>“Yes, daddy, I forgive you.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong immediately reached out to his son with relief and hugged his soft and chubby body. As he hugged the little bun, the familiar scent of a baby and milk wafted through his nose, instantly dissipating the coldness of his body.</p>
<p>“Thank you, son,” Shen Yichong said tenderly and gently.</p>
<p>Little bun also stood on tiptoe and patted his dad’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, we are men. The past is in the past. Let go.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong suddenly wanted to laugh at the mature words coming out of the innocent mouth. But soon, his son’s next word made his smile slowly fade.</p>
<p>“Daddy, that solved the first thing yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Then, what is the second thing?”  Shen Yichong asked his little bun with a stiff smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Daddy, I want to be on TV with mommy!”</p>
<p>As the saying goes, one should not judge people’s thoughts by their appearance. His son’s angelic appearance almost caught him off guard!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows are twitching at the sudden response of his child. “You are less than five years old, Shen Rui. Many people will see you on TV, then later, if you go to school…”</p>
<p>The little bun lifted his chin and met his father’s eyes with a firm and determined gaze.</p>
<p>“Of course, that’s the best! That way, my teachers and classmates will know that I have the most gorgeous mommy in the world and they will become jealous of me!” There’s joy and pride in his tone.</p>
<p>However, Shen Yichong suddenly became gloomy. Yu Yaoyao had never been to the kindergarten to pick up the little bun. Every time, his son would enviously look at the backs of other children who were accompanied by their mothers.</p>
<p>“Let dad think about it,” Shen Yichong replied.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was somewhat convinced, yet reason was still prevalent in his heart. He thought that the child was too young and public exposure would only bring harm rather than good. Shen Rui was too young to be able to judge and was incapable of considering the long term impact. But, as a father, he had to consider it for his son.</p>
<p>However, revealing his appearance would only make him the main target of some strangers and just thinking of the consequences was unbearable.</p>
<p>The little bun looked at his father and saw his worried expression. He lowered his head and sighed heavily.</p>
<p>“Okay, dad,”  little bun said to ease his father’s worries.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong touched his little head and walked out of the room. Little bun turned and threw himself onto the pillow his mother had slept on and buried his chubby little head inside!</p>
<p><em>Dad still disagrees. Annoying!</em></p>
<p>His little bottom moved around in agitation, but upon remembering his mother by his side, he got up and lay on the bed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until a sweet embrace encircled him from behind which made the little bun surprised.</p>
<p>“Baby, why haven’t you gotten up yet? Are you waiting for the rays to shine on your body and take a picture of it?</p>
<p>Shen Rui’s black eyes suddenly brightened, his whole body was relaxed on the bed. Then he reached out to Yu Yaoyao who had just changed into her travel outfit and stretched out his cute, milky white hand.</p>
<p>“Mommy, I want to film with you…”</p>
<p>He was going to fight his stingy dad to the end! Even if his close-fisted dad disagreed, Shen Rui could not be stopped from appearing on TV!</p>
<p>He was a very fierce tiger cub!</p>
