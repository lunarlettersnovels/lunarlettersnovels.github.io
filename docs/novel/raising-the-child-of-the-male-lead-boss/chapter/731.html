            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 20 – Positive Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Before they had arrived at the amusement park, Yu Yaoyao had sent the ultrasound photos she found together with a written explanation to her agent, Ni Yi, who was going bald from stress.</p>
<p>“Thank goodness, Elder Sister! I was almost scared to death! No wonder you weren’t together with the crew of the production team that day—it was because you had morning sickness and had to rest, therefore you were only able to attend the filming on September 28!” Ni Yi’s voice took an ecstatic tone. “Which means the love letter should have been written 22 days after meeting the film emperor! And not after 23 days like those harlots have claimed!”</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao was only flustered. “Why you! Why didn’t you say so earlier? You actually wanted me to explain first to you!?”</p>
<p>On the other side of the line, Ni Yi paused before he apologetically replied. “This, oh… you’re actually not good with math. My bad.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao: “!”</p>
<p>She had learned basic math through an online course together with elementary students and soon the secondary level. Rather than her, it has to be said that it was the author of this novel who wasn’t good with math and left behind a plot hole!</p>
<p>“Anyhow Sister, the good news is, it’s a false alarm!” As if remembering Yu Yaoyao’s brashness, he added. “And won’t make a move until I report this news to the company. We’ll ask for a press release to fight back against this slander. I’m going to hang up first, Sister. You have a good time!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>The person at the highest ladder of the entertainment company was just beside her. <i>Why does she need others to explain for her when she has this great god as her husband?</i></p>
<p>Without waiting for another moment, she immediately tweeted an update on her own microblog account. The crucial point of all of it was that Big Fish Entertainment did not release beautiful photographs of her, which would cause even more negative criticism!</p>
<p><b><i>Yu Yaoyao: @BigFishEntertainment, this is what I wrote to my baby son who was still inside my belly. It was my first time on set with amazing actors and my own acting skills were still unpolished. Moreover, I had nothing and no one to rely on. Only my own baby has given me the strength and courage to persist. But unexpectedly, this memory was used against me, slandering my love for my baby. Please apologize to me and the baby!</i></b></p>
<p>She then wrote in another tweet- <b><i>@DirectorLiBo, the first time I met the film emperor was the day after, of this fact you know best. I look forward to working with the director again next week. I will try my best to perform this time.</i></b></p>
<p>This Weibo statement was posted together with her ultrasound picture, of which the date was printed on the upper corner—-truly proving her claim that it wasn’t after 23 days when the love letter had been written. She had uploaded a total of 9 pictures; in the other eight pictures were all beautiful selfies taken inside the car in various poses with her child and cold husband.</p>
<p>Ni Yi had finished reporting to the company. He wiped his forehead dripping with sweat, ready to publish the draft he had been writing on the company’s official microblog when he found out that ‘<i>Yu Yaoyao’ </i>was 15th on the hot search again in an instant!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was very angry with rumormongers! And the body of the netizens was summoned out again. On her Weibo were hundreds of comments, which was soon flooded with more than a thousand!</p>
<p><b><i>Hahaha! Starting a rumor really achieves nothing, but only to be slapped back quickly in the face!’</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Big Fish Entertainment is still an authoritative media company and should not be responsible for creating malicious gossip!</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Haha, this 18-line<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup> actress also even had a witness. You weren’t expecting that, right?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Just asking Big Fish Entertainment, are you tired of making up stories? Still recording? </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>God is working!</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>It’s too much to slander a mother and her child!</i></b></p>
<p>Soon, another sharp-eyed netizen discovered the eight other photos posted together with the ultrasound image, and the discourse was shifted towards her beauty.</p>
<p><b><i>This actress looks like a fairy, with no imperfections at all in any angle! I can’t believe she isn’t more known!</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>This face—I’d lick my screen just to eat!’</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>She was a bad actor on the street five years ago and was nearly turned down by various directors. In the end, she married a bigshot and retired as a rich wife. Just last week, she said she was going to make a comeback!</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Hey, the moment one comes out of hiatus, they are immediately targeted by haters! </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>So the arm she’s clinging to is the big shot husband?!</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Next to her dressed in a Doraemon costume—that small Dango is the protagonist of the love letter, her baby?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Is the family on an outing? W*T*F! The family obviously has a harmonious relationship, ah. This entertainment news reporter is blind!</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Mother and son in matching Doraemon costumes, so cute~</i></b></p>
<p>Ni Yi almost vomited blood at his disobeyed orders! “But it seems to have a positive effect… it isn’t negative at all?”</p>
