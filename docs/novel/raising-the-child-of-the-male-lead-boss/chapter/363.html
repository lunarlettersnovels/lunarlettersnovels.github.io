            <p><strong>Chapter 400</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>After nearly a month, ‘Killer’ had basically entered the final stage of filming.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s condition was excellent. She successfully completed the remaining shots without any discomfort.</p>
<p>Director Liang and screenwriter Liu were all relieved.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t long until someone else started to worry about Yu Yaoyao’s condition; Director Zhao Yu.</p>
<p>According to the agreement, the recording of ‘Welcome to My Home’ was supposed to officially start.</p>
<p>After he received the first shooting location Shen Yichong selected, he set up the shooting team and got everything ready. Then, he excitedly communicated the recording time with all the guests, made a shooting plan, and patiently waited for the shooting to start.</p>
<p>However, two weeks before the shooting was due to start, he received the news that Yu Yaoyao was pregnant. He almost burst out crying on the spot.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, can our shooting continue? We’ve already liaised with the platform about the broadcast time. The publicity is all set up,” he paused before he said, “Huh? Just continue as usual?”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu felt like he was on a roller coaster of emotions; frightened and then suddenly elated.</p>
<p>Recording as usual meant he could record Yu Yaoyao for the duration of her pregnancy. If the couple agreed, there was even a high chance he could share her birthing process, and the first information on the baby!</p>
<p>This was far beyond what was expected from the content of ‘Welcome to my Home’. It would doubtless be very attractive to the audience.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was extremely excited. “Mr. Shen, please feel free to let us know if there’s anything you need during the filming process. We’ll be sure to arrange the best accommodation for you. You need a place where there is a hospital nearby? Okay! We should bring a medical team with us? No problem! Rest assured.”</p>
<p>After that, Zhao Yu couldn’t sleep for several days. As the shooting time approached, he became more and more nervous.</p>
<p>He personally went to make sure the medical conditions around the shooting location were decent; without Shen Yichong asking him to do so. Any location that was isolated or lacking in medical facilities was swiftly removed.</p>
<p>He even reconsidered several intense summer camp plans proposed by the show screenwriter and replaced them with safer itineraries.</p>
<p>Soon, the recording for the first episode of the program was underway.</p>
<p>The location was in the ancient city of Banshan. It felt like it was spring the whole year round. Although the housing looked outdated and remote, it was only a 15-minute drive from the city center.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s outfit for the day was a black dress that covered her slightly distended belly, and a large pair of sunglasses. Aside from the slight bulge on her stomach, she didn’t look like a pregnant woman at all. Not even her legs or ankles were swollen. Her face was radiant and bright from all the extra nutrients, and her step seemed to be that much more springy and energetic.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong and Little Bun guarded her every step of the way. The only reason they had agreed to let her carry on with the shooting was because she had no morning sickness, and she was in perfect health.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, Director Zhao.” Yu Yaoyao smiled and waved in greeting.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu led the way with a smile. He brought them to an exquisite two-story duplex house with a beautiful backyard. The original owner of the house had carefully cultivated various kinds of flowers and plants, making the place look like a garden of wonders.</p>
<p>Just a little distance behind the backyard was a small pond that looked like it could be fished in. To the left and right of this were fields of vegetables the owner had grown himself. He seemed to be a very self-sufficient person.</p>
<p>Little Bun held his mother’s hand as he looked around. He found everything so interesting.</p>
<p>“This is for your living expenses. The first batch of guests will check-in in the next two days.” Zhao Yu put a red envelope in Yu Yaoyao’s hands that were trembling with excitement. “You can’t use any other funds. While your living expenses are paid for, you have to make money by completing tasks.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao took the money out of the red envelope after Zhao Yu finished speaking.</p>
<p>There was only a 100 Yuan.</p>
<p>“You’re getting stingy, comrade Zhao. There are so many of us, and we have guests to entertain…” Yu Yaoyao protested.</p>
<p>“This’s the idea,” Director Zhao said, handing a card to Shen Yichong. “You will receive additional funds as soon as you meet the above conditions.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pressed his thin lips together as he read over the card. Then he turned a suddenly tired look to Director Zhao Yu.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao moved closer to take a look.</p>
<p>“Your family can start the live broadcast now. You’ll get 10 Yuan for every 10,000 viewers. We’ll take 10% of the gifted funds from the viewers and convert them into family funds. However, you’re not allowed to ask the audience for money or hint at it for the duration of the live broadcast. Otherwise, 100 Yuan will be deducted from the family funds each time you do. Live broadcaster: Must be a male,” Director Zhao Yu said, as Yu Yaoyao finished reading.</p>
<p>She raised her head and gave Shen Yichong a sympathetic look.</p>
<p>The program was taking care of her. They didn’t want her to work, which was why they were asking her husband and son to do the live broadcast.</p>
<p>But she knew Shen Yichong would try and keep the attention off his son. Which left the live mission all up to him.</p>
<p>So now, a stoic, quiet man had to do the live broadcast and get enough fans and gift money to complete the task.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao found the task to be a little difficult. “Good luck, darling. We’re counting on you!” she said, reaching out a hand towards him in support. “I want steak for dinner tonight.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes widened.</p>
