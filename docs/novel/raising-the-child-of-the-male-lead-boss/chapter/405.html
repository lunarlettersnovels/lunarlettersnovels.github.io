            <p><strong>Chapter 358</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>While Ling Shuang’s face went even paler, her eyes filled with anger and shame. When she glanced at Shen Yichong’s handsome face, her body trembled.</p>
<p>When she came to her senses, she threw herself at Chen Jiao as if she were insane. “Brother Jiao, I was wrong. I was wrong all the time! I beg for your forgiveness. I was forced to commit all the crimes from before. I didn’t want to lie to you! I am willing to do anything to compensate, as long as you are willing to forgive me! ”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was here. If he heard that she was a girl who achieved prosperity and wealth only through tricks, what would he think of her? If he knew that she obtained all she had now through lies, would he still like her?</p>
<p>No. No way! If he found out about that, she would be abandoned for the rest of her life! She would never be able to replace Yu Yaoyao and marry Shen Yichong! She would also lose Chen Jiao’s love and care. She would even lose all the gold rings and attention!</p>
<p>She didn’t want to go back to the time when her father was a worker, and her mother was laid off. She didn’t want to be an ordinary person and marry an ordinary man!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ling Shuang shivered. “Brother Chen Jiao, I will give you all the money I earn in the future. All my glory would also belong to you! Brother Jiao, please don’t tell them the truth. Give me another chance!” she said as she burst into tears. She reached out and hugged Chen Jiao’s arm tightly. “I’ll do everything for you in the next life. I will listen to everything you say in this life! I will follow every single word you say! Don’t abandon me, don’t ignore me! Stop telling them, please…”</p>
<p>Guo Li, who was standing near them, couldn’t help but frown when she saw her burst into tears.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s usually handsome, gentle face was contorted with disgust. He didn’t even want to reach out and push her away. He felt that any part of his skin that she touched would rot off. He shook his arm and tossed her off.</p>
<p>With a bang, Ling Shuang slammed into the coffee table behind her. The two cups toppled over and emptied their contents all over her.</p>
<p>But even so, it didn’t bring any more warmth into Chen Jiao’s eyes. He looked at her as if he were looking at a dirty and hateful creature. A sarcastic, bitter smile twisted over his lips. Ling Shuang was vicious, Yu Xinjie was despicable, but he himself was really stupid!</p>
<p>Chen Jiao smiled bitterly and looked at Yu Yaoyao enjoying the walnuts. The light in his eyes became soft and warm. “The girl I have always kept in my heart. I was waiting to give her the best things in the world when I finally become successful one day…” he spoke through the pain in chest. He even kicked Ling Shuang to the ground when she rushed at him again.  “But this girl was replaced by a despicable, scheming woman! She lied to me about her hand injury, about her moving, about being able to skip a grade because she was smart… She lied to me all this time to get things that shouldn’t belong to her!” Chen Jiao walked slowly to Yu Yaoyao, ignoring Ling Shuang who was sobbing and crying on the ground.</p>
<p>His heart was beating so fast. “In this story, the girl who was impersonated, the girl in my heart, is you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had guessed that this was the plot a long time ago. But when she heard this ridiculous story from his lips, she felt that it was a little too much. She picked up the iced watermelon juice and took a big sip.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyes affectionately watched her movement. “I’m sorry that she hurt you today. I’m sorry that I only found you today.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao chuffed into her mouth and accidently spurted her juice everywhere. That line gave her goosebumps.</p>
<p>“Wait,” she raised her hand to stop his ‘moving’ speech.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang picked herself up off the ground with the last ounce of her strength. She was trying with all her might to hold onto her last lifeline. “Mr. Shen, you heard it all! Chen Jiao and Yu Yaoyao have been hooking up for years already! She has always wanted to cheat, but I’ve stopped Chen Jiao for many years! But now, he feels that I am obstructing him, and he wants to kick me away. He shamelessly wants to hook up with a married woman. They have robbed you of your dignity, Mr. Shen!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at her indifferently. His expression didn’t even change. The hand that had been peeling the walnuts paused, then he raised it into the air to make a gesture.</p>
<p>In the next second, a bodyguard clapped a hand over Ling Shuang’s howling mouth. Ling Shuang couldn’t say a word, and her face turned paler as she struggled to breathe.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t even look at her. He took the napkin and wiped the hand that had been sabotaged by her saliva. He looked in disgust at the small plate of walnuts he had just peeled off. “Drag her down and have her mouth covered. Let her peel off all the walnuts in the shop before leaving,” he said coldly.</p>
<p>The bodyguard immediately dragged Ling Shuang, who could finally breathe again, away.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang had forgotten to even struggle. As if she had fallen into a pit of ice, she was unable to move.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong… Wasn’t he a man who would spoil his wife?</p>
<p>She had nearly been suffocated!</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong saw her being dragged away, he raised his eyes and looked coldly at Chen Jiao standing in front of them. “Get her back?” he pushed the plate of walnuts to Chen Jiao, “Jiao, take what you deserve. Don’t touch the ones that don’t belong to you. I told you of this condition way back then.”</p>
<p>At this, Chen Jiao suddenly raised his eyes.</p>
