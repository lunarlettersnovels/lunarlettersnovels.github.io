            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 187 – Through Thick And Thin (1)</strong></p>
<p>The next morning, Yu Yaoyao woke up and discovered the news that was rampaging the night before. Her social media account was flooded with comments with regards to her husband’s wealth, conjecturing that his company was not doing well and would soon declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The reason why she checked her SNS account was to determine how much her fans had increased in number. Instead, she was stupefied by the news revolving around her family. Even then, there were many people who did not know them well and still dared to message her directly and ask her strange questions.</p>
<p><strong>[Mrs. Shen, is President Shen experiencing an economic crisis at the present time?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Is your husband no longer rich?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[YYY, without money, you can no longer star in various in-demand dramas! HAHAHAH]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Serves you right!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[In “My Wife and I”, you moved to a small villa to shoot. Did you sell the original villa?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The reason why you made a comeback is that Boss Shen does not have enough money, and you had to come out to make money, right?]</strong></p>
<p>After reading the news as well as the comments and messages, Yu Yaoyao stared blankly at her phone for a long time as if she was processing all the information she’d received and almost stumbled as she was unable to control herself from laughing at what she just read!</p>
<p>She went downstairs for breakfast. Seeing Shen Yichong in the living room, she rushed towards him wearing her slippers and hugged him from behind!</p>
<p>“Husband, I just got out of the bed. You know, everyone almost killed me because of their insane joke!” Yu Yaoyao said, then laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“They said that your pockets are empty and that the company will soon go bankrupt. They also asked me if the reason why I came back into the industry was to make money! HAHAHAH” Yu Yaoyao added.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was distracted by his wife’s sudden actions, stopped and forgot that he was talking to Chen Lin at this moment. His back stiffened as it touched the soft chest, his expression was still cold and gloomy and in an instant, he stretched out his hand to pull Yu Yaoyao from behind.</p>
<p>Looking down, he gave her a subtle look, and Yu Yaoyao stared at him in return. In a flash, his dark eyes seemed to have ignited with a faint light.</p>
<p>“What if I go bankrupt?” he said looking her in the eyes.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pursed her lips and rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Say what, how is it even possible~ Husband, have you eaten breakfast?”</p>
<p>She knew that Shen Yichong had a vast amount of money, how could he go bankrupt?</p>
<p>The light in Shen Yichong’s eyes suddenly vanished, his face turned gloomy. Ni Yi, who was waiting for Yu Yaoyao, stood up from the sofa and scratched his head.</p>
<p>“Uhmm… Sister, Director Zhou Lin called and asked you to urgently go to the set to shoot a segment,” Ni Yi said hastily as if he was being chased by a dog.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was still for awhile, the thought of clinging to her husband’s arm like a koala was instantly replaced by Ni Yi’s words.</p>
<p>“Really? Now?” At that moment she’d already taken Shen Yichong’s arm but loosened her hold on it.</p>
<p>“You can eat breakfast in the car, I’ve already packed some for you.” Ni Yi glanced at Shen Yichong, Chen Lin looked stunned at the assistant’s brief actions.</p>
<p>In fact, Ni Yi had arrived at eight in the morning. But because he didn’t want to disrupt Yu Yaoyao’s beauty sleep, he had decided to wait for her. However, it didn’t take long for Chen Lin to arrive and report to Shen Yichong that Guangxin Entertainment was facing a dilemma.</p>
<p>After listening to them, Ni Yi couldn’t sit still. He was also concerned about the future as well as the problems the company was facing, after all, he was an assistant hired for a Guangxin Entertainment artist. It would have a great impact on his salary. He knew that he had no great position in the company but listening in on this kind of topic was a big deal for all company employees.</p>
<p>However, after seeing Yu Yaoyao in the living room, he wanted to give the couple their own sweet time and from where he sat, he clearly saw President Shen’s eyebrows twitch when he heard Yu Yaoyao talk about bankruptcy! He had a hunch that the boss absolutely did not like to hear his wife say things like bankruptcy!</p>
<p>“The crew assistant sent me a message last night at eleven, sister, but I know that you’d be already asleep, so I decided not to bother you. It would take some time to do your makeup, we have to leave now.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hesitated, but in the end, still nodded as she had no chance to refuse.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had a strong liking for her career. If the entire crew was waiting for her, then it was not good to not appear on the set. Also, the gloomy husband would for sure criticize and punish her again. Thinking about it heedfully, she sighed pitifully,</p>
<p>“Hmmm, I thought I could rest today.”</p>
<p>After being interrupted by the sudden summons from the director, the news about the bankruptcy of her company temporarily left her mind and so, she reluctantly waved goodbye to her husband.</p>
<p>As soon as they got into the car, Ni Yi helped her take out the packed foods one by one. But the moment Yu Yaoyao, who was sitting in the last row of the car, saw the unappetizing breakfast, grabbed a bite of whole wheat bread, and her brows immediately wrinkled.</p>
<p>“Hmm… It tastes bad. This bread is too hard!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>“That’s for weight control.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao glanced at him with incredulity.</p>
<p>“Sister, it is easier to get fat than to lose weight.” He didn’t hesitate in making the facts known.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt like a headache coming because of <strong>that</strong> word again. So, she waved at him, signaling him to say nothing more. But a bite of the hard, and tasteless bread reminded her of the aromatic and mouth-watering paella from last night.</p>
<p>She also recalled the oysters that her husband fed her yesterday. It was so fresh that she drooled whenever she thought about it. Being with Shen Yichong was better than being with Ni Yi~ at least Shen Yichong never let her eat less than three meals a day. In addition, whenever she was caught stealing snacks, he would only reprimand her and not really force her to lose weight.</p>
<p>Ni Yi ignored Yu Yaoyao’s signal and rambled on. “Let’s do our best for this show. If you do not show your capabilities, the director will not like you, and the audience’s love for you will drop in a flash.”</p>
<p><em>Humans are just like that. </em>But… it seems that Shen Yichong never said that she looks fat, he never uttered such words… She frowned while looking at Ni Yi, she wanted to go home and eat the breakfast Shen Yichong made for her.</p>
<p>But soon she thought of something and she started to rummage through her bag. She puffed her mouth knowing that Ni Yi had removed something.</p>
<p>“Ni Yi, what about the jam? What about my flower sauces? Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Sister, that has a lot of calories. You are not allowed to eat those!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao: “…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was now filled with anguish! She wanted to go home and be with Shen Yichong! It seems that he was the best and only man for her in this world!</p>
<p>With a sigh, she couldn’t help but think about the gossip she read in the morning. After biting on the bread, she took out her mobile phone and looked at her account. Unexpectedly, a series of news about him emerged.</p>
