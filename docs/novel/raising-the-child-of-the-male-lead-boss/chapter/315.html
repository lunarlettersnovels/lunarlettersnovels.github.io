<p>“Little Rui, uncle isn’t—”</p>
<p>Little Bun shook his head,” Say no more, Uncle Gangster. My daddy is very stubborn. You’ll only be annoyed if you talk to him. It’s normal to be scolded by him and have insomnia. I used to be so annoyed that I didn’t feel like eating. I understand your suffering. But it’s not right for you to mess things up just because of this. You’ll only suffer more.”</p>
<p>The corners of Chen Jiao’s mouth twitched. Seeing that he didn’t respond, Little Bun thought Chen Jiao didn’t believe him. So, he walked over and pulled his trousers lightly.</p>
<p>“Since we can’t sleep.. Uncle, shall we sit on the steps and chat to kill time?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyes jumped. Where did this kid learn all these! Did he watch too much TV? He had a completely different personality from Shen Yichong. He didn’t want to chat with the kid, but his pants were almost torn off by the kid’s persistence.</p>
<p>He could only be dragged forward by Little Bun. And as soon as he sat down, Little Bun showed him his tablet. When it was unlocked, the densely packed apps were revealed, such as ‘Hujiang Online School’, ‘Preschool Education’, ‘Complete Knowledge of Elementary School’, ‘Basic Violin’,…Various learning software.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s brows twitched, and he glanced at the child sympathetically. No wonder he was so mature although he was still so young.</p>
<p>Little Bun quickly clicked on these icons. “If I talk back to my daddy, he’ll punish me with homework and ask my teacher to give me more work. He would also spank me to teach me a lesson. But mommy said that daddy had always been like this. He always said what he isn’t mean, and that he’s only bad at expressing. Mommy also said when we face someone like daddy, we should open our eyes and see more of what he’s doing, instead of just listening.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was stunned. This was simply an initiation! Shen Yichong was indeed not good at expressing. No matter how much he had done before, Shen Yichong would never praise him in person. Even when Shen Yichong clearly hoped that he would try different things, he still gave him the freedom to do what he liked. He even refused to keep him when he wanted to leave Guangxin.</p>
<p>But if he were to look only at Shen Yichong’s behavior, it would become clear. He had planned for himself step by step.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao felt that he was probably really wrong before. He didn’t know and understand Shen Yichong as much as Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Little Bun continued to reason with him, “You are still not able to compete with my daddy, Uncle Gangster.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s eyelids twitched. Only, this nickname.. he could not accept.</p>
<p>“I probably understand what you are thinking. When mommy was ignoring me and daddy was busy with work, I also tried to make myself present. I always make trouble, skip meals at home, pretend to be sick, refuse to go to the nursery, and destroy daddy’s stuff… but in the end, all I got was to get beat up.” Little Bun shrugged helplessly. “Uncle Gangster, it turns out that being a bad kid is useless.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao only felt distressed. How could he be the same as a five-year-old? But these words did poke his heart anyway.</p>
<p>“Then, I gave up in the end…” Little Bun lowered his head as he talked, and his eyes were gleaming. “When I was about to stop caring about everything, my mommy suddenly started to embrace me and love me, saying that she was just training me before..”</p>
<p>He snuffled as he spoke, giving him a sympathetic look. “Uncle Gangster, so it’s not good to be bad. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was speechless. Although he was silent, his mind was rolling with thoughts. But soon, Little Bun also showed him a few videos and photos.</p>
<p>“This is my little sister. Isn’t she cute? She’s so lovely.”</p>
<p>Little Bun spoke as if he were promoting sales. Then, Little Bun showed each app on the screen proudly.</p>
<p>“These are all the fairy tales I recorded for my little sister. There’s only mommy who’s taking care of my little sister at home. She must be tired, and she needs to rest more. This is why I recorded these before heading out. Six stories can be played a day, so they won’t get repeated. We’ll cycle these for a week before we change to new ones.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao glanced at them, and he felt as if his chest was hammered. The photos of the baby the kid showed to him were indeed very cute, and Yu Yaoyao, who was holding the baby, also looked like a loving mother.</p>
<p>She looked very happy.</p>
<p>He was completely persistent, but still was unable to intervene in her life. Even Little Bun’s neatly arranged files were like basins of cold water that poured down his head. Even a little kid could do this much for his little sister out of love. And what did his so-called ‘love’ do?</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s face was suddenly desolate. When Yu Yaoyao said he only loved himself, he thought it was impossible. He even wanted to make up to her, proving to her that he could also do everything for her. But from the beginning to the end, what had he done? He couldn’t even compare to a five-year-old.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao staggered to his feet.</p>
<p>“Uncle Gangster?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao grinned a bitter smile, “I was wrong, Little Rui.”</p>
<p>Little Bun also stood up. He patted his butt and stretched out his hand to touch the corner of Chen Jiao’s clothes. “It’s okay. You’re still a good boy if you correct your mistakes in time.”</p>
<p>The corners of Chen Jiao’s mouth twitched.</p>
<p>“Just apologize to daddy and mommy. If not, you could also write a self-reflection essay. If it still doesn’t work, you can also write two of them!” Little Bun said seriously.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>On the second day of the live broadcast, viewers discovered that the relationship between Little Bun and Chen Jiao had suddenly changed!</p></div>
