<p><strong>Chapter 389</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Chen Jiao was bitter. The sources of information were supposed to be reliable.</p>
<p>Guo Li had gone to Shen Yichong’s attorney’s assistant to search for the information. They even took pictures of the contracts they signed.</p>
<p>Were they still trying to hide something?</p>
<p>Chen Cheng from Wansheng called anxiously while Chen Jiao was still trying to sort through his thoughts. “How did it go? Was it successful?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No,” Chen Jiao said blandly, halting the rest of his questions.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng sighed when he heard this. “Then we have no other choice. I guess this is the way it’s going to be. We are fighting Guangxin in every way possible. It would be weird if Shen Yichong agrees to his wife performing in it. Jiao, how about this? Let’s keep our distance from them. We never liked them to start off with.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao frowned when he heard this.</p>
<p>Was Wansheng warning him to stay away from Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao?</p>
<p>Were both of them now officially enemies since a cooperation was not possible?</p>
<p>He seemed to be planning something big.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao could do nothing but agree.</p>
<p>When he went back to the study, it was to find that the episode which was previously rated eight stars was now rated at one star by a large group of people.</p>
<p><em>[Rubbish drama! Is this catering to a fool?]</em></p>
<p><em>[The heroine is messed up! That’s all I can say!]</em></p>
<p><em>[What a mess!]</em></p>
<p><em>[How did it get such a high rating? I don’t understand!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Stop being funny. How can a heroine that is skipping school get hundreds of millions of clicks? Imagine the bad influence it will have on our teenage girls!]</em></p>
<p><em>[How did this theme even pass the trail? I strongly suggest it be taken down!]</em></p>
<p>Chen Jiao was in shock as he looked at the comments.</p>
<p>Was this Wansheng’s doing?</p>
<p>All these bad reviews had appeared since Yu Yaoyao had refused to star in ‘Emergency’. So many bad reviews flooded in before ‘Allure’ was even broadcasted.</p>
<p>It seemed like Wansheng was getting revenge on the drama that Shen Yichong had invested in.</p>
<p>Aside from frustrating Shen Yichong, it could also damage Yu Yaoyao’s popularity if they could create a bad reputation for this web drama. It was easy to understand then that the next heroine Wansheng looked into would be building her success off Yu Yaoyao’s misery.</p>
<p>Washeng’s approach made sense when looked at his way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Chen Jiao frowned.</p>
<p>As an actor, he knew there was nothing wrong with Yu Yaoyao’s acting skills. The problem was the theme of a bad girl in the drama. And, as actors, what terrified them the most was the direction the comments were heading in. Something like this could ruin the drama.</p>
<p>As expected, he soon saw comments in saying:</p>
<p><em>[Thanks for helping me avoid trash]</em></p>
<p><em>[Haven’t seen it, but since it sucks so much, I’ll completely avoid it.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Goodbye.]</em></p>
<p>Affected by the bad reviews, a bunch of netizens had decided to abandon the drama all together.</p>
<p>“Xiao Yao, I just wanted to save you…” Chen Jiao said, covering his eyes. “But you won’t even give me the chance to help you…”</p>
<p>In the span of an evening, the Douban score of ‘Youth Without Regrets’ dropped by a whole point because of the bad reviews.</p>
<p>At first, not many people noticed this change. But later that evening, a hot search appeared: #Yuyaoyao’s web drama that spreads negative energy has over 100 million clicks!#</p>
<p>This hot search was so popular that it quickly moved to the top. The YY fans and the fans of the show were all furious.</p>
<p><em>[How funny! It’s become the top search with just 800 comments! How much did you buy the hot search for?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Wow, they’re willing to spend that much money just to bring my husband down!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I wonder if those who wrote those shitty comments have even seen the show? Do you know what the storyline this week is about?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Absolute nonsense!]</em></p>
<p>Even a few keyboard heroes on the Internet who had been following the trend started criticizing the show. The number of negative comments were almost as numerous as the people in the YY fanbase.</p>
<p>The topic even caught the attention of mothers. They were worried what their children would learn from watching a show where the main topic revolved around bad influences.</p>
<p>What made it worse was the fact that the topic was accompanied by a lot of videos titled things like ‘Qian Duoduo fighting’, ‘Qian Duoduo skipping class’, ‘Qian Duoduo swearing’. And just like that, mothers who had not watched the show started angrily commenting how they would boycott it online.</p>
<p>There were also some people who mentioned several official organizations such as the Youth Organization and newspaper companies in the comments. They asked that these organizations take this matter into serious consideration and remove it from the Internet immediately.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao almost laughed when she saw the hot search. “How I miss this. It’s been such a long time since someone started a hot search for me. I’ve been so bored Meng Xinran.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was busy on a video call with Shen Lin, explaining the measures they needed to take to put a stop to this. He frowned when he heard what his wife said.</p>
<p>But he pretended not to hear and continued to talk to Shen Lin, “Edit the key clips of the two latest episodes. Focus on the scenes of Qian Duoduo returning to school and staying up late to study. And edit those scenes in the first four episodes where it looked like she was being a bully but was really saving others. The PR team needs to post these edits immediately.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt these changes to be a great pity, “Darling, are you taking them down already? A first-place hot search…  I wonder how many hours they bought?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong touched her head helplessly. “If they hold onto certain parts of the film, it’s very likely that we will be asked to edit it before broadcasting it.” He knew the public opinion would either carry or sink the drama. “The sooner we sort this out, the better.” As he spoke, he also asked Shen Lin to take down the hot search; not matter what it would cost.</p>
