<p><strong>Chapter 370</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>Little Bun’s thoughts disappeared into his own imagination. He was smiling so widely that even his gums were exposed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong had no idea that his son’s imagination had already begun to run wild. All he knew was that when he saw the dress, he had a vastly different opinion to everyone else.</p>
<p>“The neckline is too low.” Shen Yichong frowned. He knew his wife’s figure best. The model in the photo wasn’t as plump as Yu Yaoyao. Their upper bodies were the same. But Yu Yaoyao would look very… sexy in this. His frown deepened as he inspected the rest of the dress. “The skirt is too short.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi paused. He’d just been about to leave. “Hmm? It looks fine to me.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted.</p>
<p>But Little Bun moved his gaze over to the picture again as Shen Yichong spoke. He nodded in agreement with his father. This truly was a rare occasion. “Too short.” He poked his chubby finger at Ni Yi’s phone screen and nodded.</p>
<p>“Ah…” Yu Yaoyao hummed, starting to become a little bit uncertain of her own vision. Even her son was disagreeing. “Alright then, I’ll leave it up to the two of you to choose for me.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong and Little Bun nodded at the same time.</p>
<p>Little Bun knew that he had no skirts, only pants. Still clinging onto the idea of wearing a matching outfit with his mother, he desperately started searching for an outfit with trousers.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, on the other hand, felt that his wife no longer needed to try a get people’s attention by selling her long-legged figure. The more conservative her outfit, the better.</p>
<p>In the end, the outfit father and son decided on was mutually agreed upon.</p>
<p>“Oh… Okay,” Yu Yaoyao said after she’d taken a look.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>On the day of the premiere, Yu Yaoyao wore her husband and son’s choice of clothing. It was a light blue pantsuit and a stylish coat. In a showy contrast to her image on screen, she’d swept her hair up into a high ponytail that revealed her delicate face and forehead. Overall, she looked professional, beautiful, and neat.</p>
<p>As soon as she arrived at the scene, a group of reporters started taking nonstop pictures of her.</p>
<p>After sending her off, Shen Yichong and his son entered through the back door so they could stay low-key. Shen Yichong walked into the theater wearing a dark blue, custom-made suit, while Shen Rui wore a light blue suit of the same make. They were smiling, feeling both happy and proud.</p>
<p>A husband-and-wife outfit. A couple’s outfit.</p>
<p>Their happiness only lasted until a bunch of fans and movie fanatics started pouring in.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao stepped onto the stage with Gu Qianqian, who was dressed in a lavender colored dress with matching high heels and her hand her pocket, a part of the audience near the corner started screaming, “Ah! Yaoyao husband!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong suddenly froze in his seat.</p>
<p>Little Bun frowned.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao heard the fans’ shouting from the stage. She paused and looked towards the corner when the noise had come from. She slid one hand into her trouser pocket and with the other, she drew a heart in the air. She was smiling in a way that made her eyes crease at the corners.</p>
<p>The fans immediately started screaming again. The YY fans who’d managed to get tickets to the premiere were so excited that they sounded like they were about to explode.</p>
<p>“Oh, my goodness! I’m dead!”</p>
<p>“God! My husband’s evil smile! My heart…”</p>
<p>“My husband is so handsome in this light blue suit. Did anyone take a picture? I’m going to use it as a screensaver!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong already had a terrible headache, and his wife had only been on stage for a minute.</p>
<p>Director Zhou Zhan also heard the cheering. He took advantage of the situation to make a joke, “Maybe I can consider you as the male lead in my next movie. Xiao Yu, would you be interested?”</p>
<p>Everyone present laughed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong helplessly lowered his head and pinched his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Daddy,” Little Bun said, gently pulling his sleeve and leaning in to speak in a secretive manner, “Mommy is a woman, can she also be a husband?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong made no response.</p>
<p>The crew of ‘Chaos’ had invited many famous celebrities in the entertainment industry to the premiere. Those who hadn’t been invited had stayed up all night to buy tickets.</p>
<p>One of the guests there who hadn’t received an invitation was Chen Jiao. He’d asked his assistant to stand in line all night and buy him a ticket. Currently, he was sitting out of sight in a corner. To try and stay low-key, he was wearing a cap and a mask. But the reporters still noticed him and were taking pictures of him.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao didn’t want to steal the spotlight from anyone, and he didn’t he want to spoil Yu Yaoyao’s moment. He left early, just after the scene where Yu Yaoyao jumped off the building and took her own life.</p>
<p>He left the theater and got into the nanny car. Once he was inside, he was safely away from everyone’s sight. Then he took out his phone and dialed a number he hadn’t contacted in a long time. “Teacher Xu Hong, I heard about your current situation from your manager. Mr. Shen opposed many of the investment plans you posed in Guangxin. Including the ‘Allure’ movie project you’ve been following up on for the past three years. So, let me just come out and say it; are you interested in working with me? I think you and I are heroes with the same idea.”</p>
