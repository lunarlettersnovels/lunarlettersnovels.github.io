<p><strong>Chapter 477</strong></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s legs went soft. She had always believed that she was a strong woman because she did coding full-time, and even moved out of her house. Since then, she had to do everything by herself. Doing as far as learning how to change the light bulb and carry the heavy boxes!</p>
<p>But she didn’t expect she would turn so weak when she saw Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Ultimately, she was ushered inside with Yu Yaoyao’s help.  She couldn’t help but notice Yaoyao’s fragrant and soft body. Fang Qiuye’s eyes were shining! Mr. Shen was really lucky! If she were to reborn as a man, she will definitely find a wife like Yaoyao.</p>
<p>After entering the house, Fang Qiuye put on the slippers that Yaoyao chose for her.</p>
<p>“Big Head, this is specially prepared for you!” she said. “Pink unicorn slippers!”</p>
<p>At the slippers’ surface, there was a soft, pink spiral sequined into the fabric; it was a design every young girl would love. Fang Qiuye almost wanted to hug and kiss the slippers! This was even specially chosen and prepared for her by Yaoyao. Happiness came too quickly and violently.</p>
<p>“Come on, let me introduce my family members to you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hooked their arms like they were best friends. She pointed to Shen Yichong who wasn’t looking at them.</p>
<p>“This is my big boss. He’s like the brain of the family,” she started. “Darling, Big Head is covered in sweat. Where are our tissues?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, the brain of the family, nodded towards Fang Qiuye and politely welcomed her. He personally went to get a pack of tissues and handed it over. Fang Qiuye was shaking and almost didn’t catch it.</p>
<p>The big boss who’s worth more than 100 million handed her a pack of tissues himself?</p>
<p>“Thank you!” she nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>Yaoyao smiled beside her. “Big Head. What would you like to drink? Do you like tea, coffee, or juice?”</p>
<p>“No, no. It’s okay. I’ll be okay with plain water.”</p>
<p>She would feel bad if her idol were to make coffee for her!</p>
<p>“Huh? Just plain water?” Yu Yaoyao patted her shoulder. “You live your life so healthily!”</p>
<p>That’s what she said, but the truth was Fang Qiuye would order milk tea or make coffee while she was coding at home.</p>
<p>“I learnt it from you, Yaoyao. Good health, good skin,” Fang Qiuye smiled.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao waved her hand dismissively after hearing it, “I don’t like drinking plain water. I stop drinking every time I finish the ration prescribed by my husband. Milk, milk tea, coffee, cola, and juice are the correct ways to replenish oneself.”</p>
<p>After drinking plain water for nearly two hundred years, she had long been tired of it. But Shen Yichong had set a daily amount for her so she was forced to meet that requirement.  Having said this, she shrugged helplessly. She pointed to the mineral water bottle that Shen Yichong brought over and cried.</p>
<p>“I have to drink five bottles of mineral water like this every day before he lets me go,” she said.  “This was before the baby was born. Now…hehe, I haven’t seen boba milk tea for a long time. So angry!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye suddenly thought of the boba milk tea she had remarked on the script and laughed on the spot. Her nervousness was relieved by half. Yaoyao was super down-to-earth. It turned out that even celebrities like her loved unhealthy drinks!</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye couldn’t help but comfort her. “It’s okay. Just bear with it a little more. You can drink it after you’re done breastfeeding.” “Right, right.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had already taken out the list. She let Big Head see the order list of her various takeaway shops. Almost every drink was on it.</p>
<p>“I’ve written down all the new products that came out. From now on, I will have one cup a day,” she muttered.</p>
<p>“Darling,” speaking of this, Yu Yaoyao looked at Shen Yichong again, “Bring me my snack box. Although I can’t eat it, Big Head can eat them. She can choose them herself. You can have some fruits too.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded, “I’ll get it. I’ll cut the fruit later.”</p>
<p>The fans in the live broadcast room were tortured by jealousy. But in addition to envying the president, they also discovered that true love definitely existed between Mr. Shen and Yaoyao!</p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao is really skilled when it comes to directing Mr. Shen to work… This must be how they interact even in normal times~]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yaoyao: My husband is a military advisor, a soldier, a cook, and a medical soldier occasionally.]</em></p>
<p>When Shen Yichong left, Fang Qiuye finally felt that the temperature at the scene was a little warmer. When she turned her head, she finally found Little Bun who was following them like a small tail. He was already getting busy beside them.</p>
<p>Aware of her eyes looking over, Shen Rui smiled sweetly at her, “Hello, aunty. Please have a seat~”</p>
<p>As he talked, he spread a white blanket on the sofa seat next to him, “Mommy usually likes to sit on it the most. Aunty, you can try it too,” he urged. “Also…”</p>
<p>He turned around and put another timer on the table. “Take a break every twenty-five minutes, or you’ll be tired!” he began and pointed,  “Eye drops, Red goji Berry Tea in the thermos bottle, and small walnuts already peeled are prepared to replenish the brain. “Auntie, Mommy, eat when you’re tired and drink when you’re thirsty!”</p>
<p>The little guy was obviously super experienced. Almost in the blink of an eye, the corner of the living room was arranged into a perfect corner for studying. Various colors of highlighters, pens, notebooks, textbooks, and even a tablet were all placed on the table. People who didn’t know might have thought they were in the house of a student preparing for the exam. The whole set was extremely professional!</p>
<p>Many fans who were just jealous in the live broadcast room were howling immediately.</p>
<p><em>[I have the same notebook!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Yeah! The same highlighter. Mine is orange!]</em></p>
<p><em>[The same Pomodoro timer! Something you must need for your postgraduate entrance examination!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I just saw my own study desk!]</em></p>
