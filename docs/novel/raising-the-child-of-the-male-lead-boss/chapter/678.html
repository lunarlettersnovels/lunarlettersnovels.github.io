            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 73 – Exposed</strong></p>
<p>“I just wanted to help everyone…” Meng Xinran took a step back and burst to tears from the pressure being directed at her.</p>
<p>At the face of this crying Meng Xinran, everyone’s suspicious eyes once dwindled again.</p>
<p>But then Yu Yaoyao sighed softly. “So, you are kind enough to decline, then why don’t you just quit altogether? Here, we are all competitors—for a moment you made everyone feel lax and drop their competitive spirit. Excuse me, but may I ask, how are you <em>helping</em> them?”</p>
<p>At this juncture, she licked her lower lip, her eyes shining with a tantalizing, ferocious light. “Who did you actually help when you did just that?”</p>
<p>Word after word, this silenced the once rambunctious set. And the people who stood around Meng Xinran, as if they found clarity in the situation, moved away from her in twos and threes. Except for the top-ranking contestants, who followed Meng Xinran closely, all those situated at the middle and bottom stepped back warily.</p>
<p>“Director, can we choose again?”</p>
<p>“We want the director’s original arrangement for the second round.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we don’t want humility…we want <em>fairness</em>!”</p>
<p>This is a variety show! As soon as Yu Yaoyao’s words fell on their ears like a brutal reminder, they immediately remembered.</p>
<p>When the time comes for the second round to be aired, the audience would see the order in which the props were to be selected. In the event that their performance level is similar to each other, how would the final score be based upon? Wouldn’t it be in the sequence in which they chose the prop?</p>
<p>That means, despite being a low-ranking contestant in the preliminary, and they somehow got the option to choose first, then there is no challenge. Moreover, the top-ranking contestants would be even given a higher impression by the audience because of their modesty. However, at the end of the line, once they lose, the people would label them as ‘just a humble person, nothing more.’</p>
<p>Although a seemingly good proposition, it was a trick nevertheless—it was not good for the back runners!</p>
<p>Everyone is immediately on high alert.</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me?” Meng Xinran raised her voice, trying to downplay the situation. But soon, she took a deep breath and lowered her head, adjust her tone to be more mellow.</p>
<p>“This was all my fault. I was too meddlesome.”</p>
<p><em>These stupid, little newcomers!</em></p>
<p>She didn’t have the need to target people like them who are on the verge of elimination. The person she wanted to deal with is none other than Yu Yaoyao!</p>
<p>Meng Xinran was so fuming inside that she was about to vomit blood, but she could not let her fury faze her exterior one bit.</p>
<p>It was bad news when Yu Yaoyao mentioned her instigating that the program is unfair, which meant the directors were biased. And when she hurriedly shot back that it was actually fair, she stood out even more in a questionable light—as she was part of the top ten.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, director. It’s my fault!” But Meng Xinran couldn’t do anything anymore and refute everything.</p>
<p>She gnashed his teeth and bowed, “I withdraw my previous proposal.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao chuckled, “You’ve already wasted a lot of everyone’s time. It’s 8:50 now.”</p>
<p>With just another sentence, all the people present turned pale. Especially those who were at the bottom, once again focused their sights on Meng Xinran. This time not only were there doubts, but also expressions of resentment and anger.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right! Their preparation time had been wasted!</p>
<p>The recording will officially start at 9 o’clock.</p>
<p>Originally, they still had time to make additional preparations, but now the clock signified they only had 10 minutes left. The amateur artists still need time to adjust their characters before shooting the scene, unlike the skilled Meng Xinran who was already well-versed in acting.</p>
<p>Therefore, the eyes of these young newcomers couldn’t help but begin to look bad. The atmosphere in the center of the set suddenly became tense at once.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran, who had originally made a proposal from her ‘goodwill’ and momentarily gained the contestants admiration, suddenly became the one isolated by a large army! On the contrary, the outspoken Yu Yaoyao made everyone rethink their decisions.</p>
<p>Ni Yi was standing together with the staff, forcing back a low cheer about to erupt from his mouth.</p>
<p><em>Elder sister, from today on—you are my idol!</em></p>
<p>How could his elder sister be so smart?</p>
<p>“The result of the vote cannot be changed,” the director’s team said to them.</p>
<p>“Since you have already made a choice in front of the camera, you must stick to it. This is also a show for actresses and actors where they could show their responsibility for their own decisions and conduct—one cannot regret what he or she has done, and have it removed from the program. Every recording should be treated as a live broadcast. So, everyone, be responsible for everything you say and do.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao shrugged her shoulders indifferently, but regretfully said, “I’m okay with it.”</p>
<p>Qiu Dajian also smiled and nodded quickly, “I also don’t care.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zhao Xiaomeng immediately agreed, while all the other contestants face had an ugly expression! They were now full of regret, strongly blaming the troublesome Meng Xinran!</p>
<p>And the culprit in question, had a sick face as if she had eaten a fly. But she soon perked up.</p>
<p>Since anyway, her goal of letting Yu Yaoyao draw the last lot was achieved!</p>
<p>As for the goodwill of these small cannon fodders in the show, it didn’t matter if she received it or not. After all, these insignificant amateurs are doomed to disappear from the entertainment circle sooner or later.</p>
<p>“All right.” Meng Xinran obediently nodded with a clever look in her eyes.</p>
