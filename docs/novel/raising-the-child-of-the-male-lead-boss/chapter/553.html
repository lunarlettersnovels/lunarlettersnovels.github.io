            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 206 – A Certain Sister’s Reappearance</strong></p>
<p>Yu Xinjie took a couple of deep breaths to keep her boiling rage in check and spoke patiently into the phone. “Sister, listen to me first-”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately started to mischievously blow into the phone mic to mimic signal break. God knows where she learned such a tactic! As if that weren’t overpowering enough, she started talking robotically while blowing air into the phone.</p>
<p>“Ah … <em><strong>whoosh</strong></em> … What did you say??“</p>
<p><em>“</em><em><strong>Bzzzzt</strong></em> … I can’t hear you!!”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie: “!!!”</p>
<p>The camera crew behind them was all stunned by her childish behaviour.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched as he reached out and hung up her phone. They had an impressionable child like Shen Rui by them. He may irrevocably learn such unkempt behaviour by example.</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie, who was probably further angered by her measly attempts at faking a bad network,  started admonishing from the other end of the phone-</p>
<p>“SISTER!!! Change your location and call me back! I have returned from abroad, I’ll drop by your house tonight!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had originally made an exaggerated show of hanging up an unwanted call, but was inadvertently startled by the loud voice and almost threw the phone away. After all, Yu Xinjie’s banshee wails had been amplified several times.</p>
<p>Even Shen Yiching next to her could hear the screeching, he frowned.</p>
<p>Director Zhao Yu eagerly pricked up his ears. Long years in show business had trained his instincts to detect any sort of fluctuations in emotions. And the drama that’s brewing ahead? Perfect scoop! He beckoned the camera and audio crew to follow closely and capture everything.</p>
<p><em>Let’s film everything first, and then worry about the consequences! If President Shen has objections to the content being broadcast, we can just delete the segment!</em></p>
<p>The seasoned Director Zhao Yu wasn’t afraid of anything.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s ears hurt when she was yelled at. She also frowned and looked at the phone unhappily.</p>
<p><em>Yu Xinjie is too annoying! It’s been a long while since I last spoke with her – Does she still not know when to take a hint?</em></p>
<p><em>But … I must compose myself first!</em></p>
<p><em>What’s she gonna do after dropping by our home? Does she think she saved a whole nation in her previous life or something?!</em></p>
<p><em>The family spent lots of money and tears to be able to afford three bloody steaks for dinner, yet she’s yapping about dropping by?</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes suddenly widened. In terms of her days in the wild, this is a territory breach!</p>
<p>“Sister, did you hear the news? As soon as I got off the plane, I saw news of my brother-in-law’s bankruptcy. Has he run out of money now?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao snorted. However, she smiled as she spoke into the phone-</p>
<p>“Ah, Sister, could it be that you want to give me some money to help meet the ends? And you even want to drop by my humble abode to send me the money in person?”</p>
<p>“Sister, are you kidding? Do I look like I have any money on me? Have you collected the 5 million yet-”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao exclaimed into the phone- “Ah? What?? You say you want to give me 5 million?? Okay! I’m waiting for the money to wire in! I must have saved a nation in my previous life to beget a sister as caring and kind as you! What an angel–”</p>
<p>By this point, the phone beeped. The other party had obviously been very angry, she hung up in a fit.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao laughed and clapped her hands: “Deal~! All our troubles have been solved~”</p>
<p>Not a soul around her made a peep as they all stared at her, speechless.</p>
<p>After a while, She Yichong took her little hand, which had frozen over due to the cold wind as she answered the call, and stuffed it into his coat pocket.</p>
<p>“Good job!” said he, “But … Next time, just hang up any unwanted calls.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her head to look at him in shock and immediately opened her small mouth- “Husband, could it be I spoke too loudly in a public setting??”</p>
<p>She had read Shen Rui’s kindergarten handbook for basic morals and manners to get more acquainted with the humans’ societal rules and there had been this particular guideline- <em>Don’t be loud in public settings.</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled faintly and squeezed her cold hand that fit snugly in his pocket.</p>
<p>“Well, if you pick calls outside in such chilly weather, you might end up getting affected by the cold.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go home, my throat has started feeling a bit uncomfortable~” Yu Yaoyao was visibly relieved.</p>
<p><em>Husband didn’t get pissed off, I’ve escaped retribution!</em></p>
<p><em>Yay!! (*￣3￣)╭</em></p>
<p>But soon, she noticed something strange.</p>
<p>The hands that were wrapped in Shen Yichong’s pockets were soon warmed by his hot hands. It didn’t take long for the warmth to start spreading from her palm, along her hands gradually making its way to her heart.</p>
