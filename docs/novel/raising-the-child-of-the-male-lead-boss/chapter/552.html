            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 208 – Forehead Kiss (2)</strong></p>
<p>The Yu Yaoyao standing behind him tiptoed to peer at his cooking prowess.</p>
<p>The cameraman managed to capture this adorable scene- Along with the eye-catching web page title on her phone.</p>
<p><strong>#Five best recipes to cure impotence in men, guaranteed to work!#</strong></p>
<p>Director Zhang, who was the first one to notice the title, turned his face to the side and tried his best to suppress his laughter in vain.</p>
<p>On hearing his pig snort, Shen Yichong glanced back suspiciously. He observed for a fleeting moment, finding nothing amiss, he went back to continue teaching Yu Yaoyao to beat eggs. He instructed her on all steps prior to and after adding leeks to the scrambled eggs.</p>
<p>Once he was done, Yu Yaoyao stood at attention and saluted. “Yes, Boss! I promise to complete the task – I won’t let you down!”</p>
<p>As she finished pledging her allegiance, Little Bun was still trying his best to clean the fruit in a distance. He stood by the children’s sink, upright, posture impeccable … But his belly was bulging out a little, making him look exactly like a real dumpling. Shen Rui shouted:</p>
<p>“Daddy, I promise to execute the task well!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was tickled by the ridiculous cuteness, but soon, the increasing fragrance of food from the kitchen, as well as the sound of laughter from the mother-son duo filled his soul to the brim. His heart no longer felt empty … It had, at last, been stuffed to the top with happiness.</p>
<p>While searing the steak and watching the soup, he stared at Yu Yaoyao’s scrambled eggs. He was also distracted by the presence of the little bun next to him. Although such day-to-day interaction may seem trivial, he found it to be extremely fulfilling. His mind had but relaxed barely three seconds-</p>
<p>Amidst a <em>hissing</em> sound, Yu Yaoyao poured the egg batter into the hot, oiled pan. In an instance, the oil abruptly started sputtering from the pan out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Instantly, she shrieked. She was so scared she even flung the spatula away, and like a big cannonball, dove into Shen Yichong’s arms with a thud.</p>
<p>The little face that could have been disfigured by the hot oil was now huddled close by his chest, trembling.</p>
<p>“Husband! The kitchen’s going to explode!!!”</p>
<p>“The oil grew wings and flew out! It wants to harm us!!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>As she was rushing over, she almost knocked her delicate, petite waist against the countertop. Shen Yichong shot a pointed look to Director Zhao Yu.</p>
<p>Director Zhao’s shoulders shook uncontrollably as he hid his grin behind his hand.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao really was afraid of fire. Thereby, it stood to reason that she was terrified by the hot oil splashing about. She didn’t know how much it could hurt if the oil had accidentally splashed on human skin, giving rise to blisters. However, her bone-deep instincts screamed at her to yeet herself to Mars.</p>
<p>Snakes are inherently cold-blooded animals by nature and could easily be grilled with the slightest bit of heat. This was an innate, primal fear.</p>
<p>She shuffled into Shen Yichong’s arms and clung to him firmly, like a koala. Shen Yichong was originally supposed to be flipping the steak to the other side. However, she was currently (shamelessly) hanging off him like dead weight, rendering him immobile. Moreover, knowing the jade fairy in his arms, he should have realized it was impossible for her to sit still and not cause chaos at every waking moment.</p>
<p>Yet, there was an even more pressing matter at hand- if the eggs in the pan weren’t immediately whisked, they would turn mushy.</p>
<p>He sighed and patted her on the back. “Give me the spatula and go lie down on the couch-”</p>
<p>He wanted to tell her to get some rest, but in the very next moment, he caught the glint of a camera by his side and gulped down the rest of the words.</p>
<p>“Go wash the fruits and arrange the fruit platter with our son, I’ll take care of the rest of the dishes here.”</p>
<p>Thus, Shen Yichong delegated her the simplest task that wouldn’t make her seem too lazy.</p>
<p>“No can do, Husband, didn’t I tell you I’m going to be cooking for you today?” Despite her fear, she adamantly stood her ground. She gingerly glanced back at the dreadful oiled pan, peeling her delicate face off his chest, her bulging cheeks akin to a hamster’s.</p>
<p>She had glimpsed Shen Yichong’s bronzed arms when he raised his sleeves and proceeded to calmly handle the skillet. For some reason, the oiled pan, which looked terrifying to her, became very docile and obedient the moment it fell in his hands.</p>
<p>“I can do it, too!” She stretched out her hand and waited, her limpid eyes staring at him. “Husband, didn’t you often say you wish to eat food made by me? I must make this scrambled egg myself!” She urged.</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong heard her words, the corners of his mouth twitched. He had long discerned she was too timid in the kitchen and could probably not be able to manage even scrambled eggs. But one look at her serious face, he gave in and went on to teach her patiently.</p>
<p>“You need to flip the eggs first, and add a little bit of water-”</p>
<p>“- Don’t be scared.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao acknowledged with a firm hum. Then, ever so cautiously and solemnly, she approached the pan as though she were marching to the frontlines of a life and death battle. Stern, straight face and arms outstretched, she quickly stirred the spatula along the pan twice.</p>
<p>All along, the little face was turned completely toward Shen Yichong, she didn’t dare look at the pan. She asked him, “Husband, are they done yet? Am I doing it correctly?? Q.Q”</p>
