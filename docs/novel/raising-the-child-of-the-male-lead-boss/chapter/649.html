            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 102 – Army of Gossipers</strong></p>
<p>“Then let’s go!” Meng Xinran stood up hastily, pretending to be anxious.</p>
<p>She immediately took the group of curious, gossiping female contestants with her and quickly rushed to the rooms with several photographers following them.</p>
<p>Once they were at the door, Meng Xinran held her breath, trying to listen to any sounds inside. But it was to no avail, as she didn’t hear anything—she owed this to the thought the walls of the room might be soundproof.</p>
<p>The female contestant next to her took charge and knocked at the door.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu.” She knocked three times, only to meet with no answer from the other side.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s heart was over the moon! <em>Are things too intense inside that she can’t hear us knocking? Or is it too extreme that she can’t stop?! And now the moment they will open the door, they will be able to see two people caught doing the immoral! And when they are caught red-handed, will the director still film such a tainted woman like her? The cast won’t probably sit well with such a person; they’ll probably ask her to quit! Haha!</em></p>
<p>“Do you think she has fainted?” Meng Xinran her erratic smile and said anxiously. “The crew probably has a spare key with them, should we go to the director and ask for it?”</p>
<p>“Ah? What if it’s nothing serious…” The female contestants were somewhat hesitant on intruding.</p>
<p>“Didn’t sister Yu fainted before from malnutrition and became hospitalised for a while?” she informed. After all, Meng Xinran was quite knowledgeable about her history. “How long will it take before it happens again…” she taunted innocently.</p>
<p>But everyone was unable to read her provoking word; they were more shaken with the thought of another contestant falling ill, some photographers were now also solemn. If someone faints while filming, it will be a serious matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, a photographer approached and knocked on the door a few times. Yet, there was still no answer.</p>
<p>“I’m calling the director!” Meng Xinran squinted her eyes, as a smile broke out her face, unable to be stopped.</p>
<p>Since they were already in the building, the staff who held the spare key was able to rush in the scene in less than two minutes. A contestant has fainted—this was a significant accident that even the deputy director has paid attention to it. But before they were able to open the door with the key, it was suddenly opened from the inside.</p>
<p>A sober Yu Yaoyao stood in front of the opened door, of which a thick scent of instant noodles wafted from inside the room. Everyone was able to catch a sniff of the appetising fragrance, making their mouths involuntary water in response.</p>
<p>“What’s happening?” Yu Yaoyao held a bowl of noodles and looked in bewilderment at the people standing with serious expressions outside her room. In the next second, she felt guilty, and her eyes became a little dodgy.</p>
<p><em>Are we forbidden to eat noodles in the set? No way. </em>Although the smell can be a bit heavy, she also opened the window for ventilation.</p>
<p>She glanced at the deputy director who had a heavy look in place, her heart thumped. “This… I ate a late-night snack because I was hungry…”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran found that Yu Yaoyao’s clear-headedness is a bit off-putting. But the moment she saw Yu Yaoyao’s shifty eyes as if she was unable to look them straight in the face, she felt a thrill in her heart!</p>
<p>“How can sister be hungry when you came back from the restaurant? We also thought you were unwell, so we came to visit you.” She continued, “We knocked on your door many times, why didn’t you open it? We all thought you fainted.” Meng Xinran skillfully said these words with a smile, and the people around her were also bewildered.</p>
<p>When the deputy director felt that nothing was amiss, he started to leave.</p>
<p>But then, “Sister, why is your face so red?” Meng Xinran stopped him in tracks with her question as she squeezed through the crowd, in front of Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Even more, she still wants to reach out and touch Yu Yaoyao’s forehead which made Yu Yaoyao step back in disgust, not allowing Meng Xinran to come near her. Yet the woman then forcefully tried to pass her to enter her room. As soon as Meng Xinran was inside, she began to look around, snooping.</p>
<p>“Sister, are you not alone? Is it my imagination that I heard the voice of a man?” When she said this, the people who are ready to leave looked back. Furthermore, the eyes of the other female contestants became gossipier.</p>
<p>After all, it was not long ago when the news of Yu Yaoyao’s scandalous picture with a man in a hotel became a hot topic in the news!</p>
<p>They suddenly cast Yu Yaoyao their doubtful glances. Upon inspection, they found that her cheeks are pink like peach blossoms, and her eyes looked glazed; this wasn’t how a person eating a late-night snack should look like at all, and now that they were able to think of it, they were knocking at the door so loudly–it was impossible for them not to be heard in such a normal situation. Moreover, she had not come out to open the door until at least five minutes had elapsed!</p>
<p><em>What has she been doing during that time? Is there something she wants to cover-up? Something unspeakable? </em></p>
<p>The director has set this as the temporary dormitory for the contestants, and to wrongly let a man come in, her courage is over the roof!</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other with their curiosity ablaze. The contestant at the top would usually be given by the program director a room to their selves, accompanied by a bathroom. And seeing her living room devoid of people but her, could the man be hiding in her bedroom?</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, your room’s layout is different from ours, ah. Can we go in and see inside?”</p>
