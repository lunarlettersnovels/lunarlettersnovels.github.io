            <p><strong>Chapter 466</strong></p>
<p>The stingy Qi Hang, who always wanted to clear his ‘debts’ and refused to treat Director Li for a long time, was finally willing to do so. If it weren’t for Director Li’s introduction back then, maybe his movie would not have won the award, nor would it have been a big box office hit.</p>
<p>The story and the content were still the same. It was the artists that made the characters alive. From a frown, a smile, to a teardrop, their performance was so natural. All these helped engrave the characters’ emotions into the hearts of the audience and himself.</p>
<p>Seeing that an art movie went big, several other producers who had collaborated with Yu Yaoyao couldn’t sit still. Many producers asked their subordinates to meet with the whole production team from before.</p>
<p>“Are there any remarks on Teacher Yu’s script back then?”</p>
<p>“Is there a short story written behind the movie?”</p>
<p>“There’s no way there’s none. It must be that you didn’t find it. Think about it again!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s box office miracle was really too powerful. From the release of the film to being broadcasted on various platforms, her power cannot be underestimated. Many producers who had already invited her and were waiting for her to accept the invitation became even more anxious.</p>
<p>“Call Teacher Yu’s manager again. Does she not like our script? It can be changed!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t Teacher Yu planning to film in the second half of next year? Have we sent our script? Do make ourselves known to her manager and Guangxin. We must prioritize her!”</p>
<p>“If you are not satisfied with the remuneration, it can be negotiated.”</p>
<p>Not only did she make herself popular, but she also even got the movie and other supporting roles and protagonists popular… She brought more worth than a best actress!</p>
<p>The producers were very cool with their replies. “She can bring capital into the crew, and Guangxin is also welcomed to invest as much as they want. The priority would be reserved for Mr. Shen. We welcome both the husband and wife, as long as they’re willing to join us.”</p>
<p>While everyone was being very enthusiastic, Yu Yaoyao was very laid back. She felt that she was now invincible in the entertainment industry, and she was feeling extremely lonely.</p>
<p>She was now more focused on learning English! During this period of time at home, she felt energetic despite being busy. She was happy no matter what she was doing.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu originally wanted to do another takeaway show because YY fans came to their official account every day to leave a message after the last episode. They asked when will the takeaway happen again, and they begged him to do a few more episodes like that because they had a menu recommendation… However, the proposal to do the takeaway again with just a change to the guest list was rejected by Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“Director Zhao, we should also change before everyone gets tired of it. Don’t you think so?” Yu Yaoyao called Zhao Yu personally.</p>
<p>Of course, Zhao Yu knew this too. It was just that the last episode really received a great response. “Sure, Xiao Yu. Let’s discuss any ideas you may have,” he said.</p>
<p>“Since there were meals for only ten people, I feel it was unfair that all people could only compete based on the speed of their internet,” Yaoyao said.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu nodded. Indeed, some netizens have suggested that they were getting anxious with their internet.</p>
<p>“Then… let’s do a lottery in advance?” he proposed.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately shot him down. “That defeats the purpose then,” she began. “Director Zhao, we need to add a term and condition for the ordering process.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“If they want to place an order, they must teach me English! Then, they must order the food in English and similarly report their address in English. How about that?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes were sparkling. She thought her idea was great!</p>
<p>“What?” Director Zhao thought he had heard it wrong.</p>
<p>But soon, he heard Yu Yaoyao’s serious voice. “Director Zhao, English is very important. It’s one of the subjects for the college entrance examination! If they don’t pass, the kids won’t be able to enter college.”</p>
<p>She listened to a few elementary school English lessons with Little Bun and tasted the sweetness of improvement. Thus, she was high on learning. Moreover, Little Bun also told her that English tests had to be passed for all levels of schooling. Recently, she also learned from Ni Yi that his elder sister even had to go through an interview conducted in English when she wanted to send her daughter to a private school.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt that she must pick up English no matter what! Her fans should also study hard. “If you don’t study well, you won’t have food.”</p>
<p>Director Zhao’s mouth twitched, but he couldn’t refute it. “Okay…then. I’ll leave the task to you then?”</p>
<p>“Sure, Director Zhao!”</p>
<p>Director Zhao wiped the sweat from his forehead as he hung up the phone.</p>
<p><em>‘I’m sorry, fans. I can’t save you!’ </em>If they had bad English, maybe they could use the word ‘hell’ more when they were talking to their idol…?</p>
<p>Soon, news was released on the official account of the show. The live broadcast would start on time at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday this week. As usual, there would only be 10 orders. First come first serve.</p>
<p>As soon as the news came out, the YY fans firmly vowed not to sleep in late this Saturday. They also vowed to go to bed early the night before. President Fang Qiuye also checked the live broadcast platform and the apps for food delivery on her phone. She even set 10 alarm clocks for Saturday morning!</p>
<p>Everyone was ready. They were just waiting for Yaoyao to start her business!</p>
<p>Sure enough, the number of people in the room jumped to 250,000, and it was still rising at exactly nine o’clock due to advance notice.  Many people came in on time even if they didn’t plan to place an order. Audiences who were planning to grab an order had their sleeves rolled up. Some even hired orders grabbing agents to help them order the takeaway…</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye screamed. “Come on. Let’s go!”</p>
<p>As a coder, she was very confident in her typing speed! However, she was quickly taken aback when Yu Yaoyao appeared on the screen. Little Bun held up a sign with a mark.</p>
<p><em>‘Please place your order in English.”</em></p>
<p><em>‘Please compliment my mommy in English.”</em></p>
<p>Fang Qiuye and the rest: “!!!”</p>
