            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 12 – Take It Easy Lying Down (3)</strong></p>
<p>“I want the baby to comfort mom with a kiss.” Yu Yaoyao stretched out her hands towards the little bun. The little bun was obviously stupefied, unable to move.</p>
<p>“Oh, my child has grown independent and now he doesn’t want his mother…my heart hurts so much.”</p>
<p>The little bun perked up and shyly approached her, trying to reach out with his neck. However, before he could kiss her, his whole soft and fragrant little body was hugged by Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao finally got close to his white, tender face like an actual steamed bun! With a loud sound, she kissed him on the cheeks shamelessly! She had wanted to do this for a long time!</p>
<p>The little bun was completely shell-shocked, but his eyes were bright like the shining stars in the night.</p>
<p>“My darling… From today on, you’ll be my baby.” She bopped his nose. “Your mother’s test and exercise for you is over, and now your whole new life is about to begin! This time, before you become an adult, your mother will stay with you all the way, watching you and kissing you.”</p>
<p>The little bun blushed an intense red, almost turning into an apple, but he quickly remembered something. Biting his little lip, he took out his tablet, pointing to it.</p>
<p>“They say mom…”  His voice was soft, a little cautious, and scared.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao bowed her head, rubbing her cheeks on his apple-colored face. “It’s all a lie. Mom has already replied that father and I wanted to have a second child. Hmm… do you want a brother or a sister?”</p>
<p>As soon as she finished speaking, she felt the air turn cold, and there was no need to think where it was coming from— Shen Yichong was glaring at her again.</p>
<p>But the little bun frowned as if he was seriously thinking about whether it was better to have a brother or sister.</p>
<p>“Still can’t make up your mind?” Yu Yaoyao was ecstatic. “It doesn’t matter. Mom is still young, and your dad is in good health; you’ll surely have younger brothers and sisters in the future~”</p>
<p>The conflicted eyes of the little bun suddenly brightened. He thought about it carefully and rubbed his little fingers against each other. “Mom, when you exercise my little brothers and sisters in the future, can I help them and stay with them?”</p>
<p>He said, glancing at her with some trepidation. “When they are lonely and sad and miss mom… I can hold them and tell them not to cry.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes flashed.</p>
<p><i>What a good baby! </i></p>
<p>“Of course you can!” She eagerly responded.</p>
<p>It was already evening and prior to this, the little bun had cried for almost half a day. Now, he was nestled in the soft arms of his mother, excited yet careful at the same time. He was nervous for a period, but his tiredness finally lulled him to sleep, towards a deep slumber.</p>
<p>When he fell asleep, he had a slight smile plastered on his face while his little hand held onto Yu Yaoyao’s hospital gown.</p>
<p>At the same time, Shen Yichong had been standing to the side, looking coldly at the mother and son’s affectionate exchange.</p>
<p>He finally opened his mouth to speak: “For your son’s sake, sign the divorce papers. I’ll give you another 5 million. And in the future, I’ll give you a chance to visit him every week.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao hugged the white and soft little bun in her arms and looked up at him.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong sneered. “You think I’m five-years-old, too?”</p>
<p>“A total of $10 million as divorce compensation. You can include the house you currently live in; I’ll give it to you.”</p>
<p>This time, his voice became icier. “Additionally, and I repeat this for the second time, don’t try to deceive and use our son against me, or else. I have a lot of ways to make you die with the <i>real </i>man in your heart!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had a bitter look on her face.<i> This male lead’s heart is too hard to shake, huh? </i></p>
<p>“Shen Yichong, do you believe your wife really died once?”</p>
<p>“Therefore…” Yu Yaoyao raised her head and reached out to grab his index finger. She sneakily tried to scratch the inside of his palm, making the person’s whole-body jolt in surprise. “I’ve come back to life a second time. And this time, my whole person is yours.”</p>
<p>Her phoenix eyes in the dark were slightly provocative. The watery pools, which held a dangerous, teasing light, resembled a mischievous goblin who had escaped from a forest…</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, with his palm limp and numb, only looked down at her from above.</p>
<p>“Shen Yichong, give me three months.” She bargained. “Little Ruirui needs a mother. You also need a wife on paper. Can’t you give me another chance?”</p>
<p>“This time I’ll be more mature about it—I’ll lie down properly and let you do whatever you like!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
