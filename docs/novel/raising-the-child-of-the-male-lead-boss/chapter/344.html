            <p><strong>Chapter 419</strong></p>
<p>When they got home, Yu Yaoyao kept her promise. She personally stuffed the basketball into Little Bun’s larger-sized vest. Then, she gave him two little oranges to be stuffed in together. After Little Bun took two steps, he happily asked Yu Yaoyao to take pictures of him. But in less than ten minutes, Little Bun’s eyebrows had wrinkled together.</p>
<p>When he bent over to tie his shoelaces, the basketball fell out of his vest. To go to the second-floor room, he had to lift his leg while holding the basketball. Because of that, he couldn’t reach and hold the railing next to him. And when he went to bed, wanting to roll over as comfortably as usual, it was even more difficult to do so.</p>
<p>“It’s really hard for mommy to give birth to a baby~” Little Bun already felt sick all over before he even had lunch.</p>
<p>Normally, he would have long been playing with Ren Sitong’s children by this time, but now he can only sit on the sofa and watch them play. When he moved a little, he would feel that the basketball was about to drop, which was very inconvenient.</p>
<p>“Alright, baby. You’ve experienced most of what mommy has experienced. Mommy will remove it for you. Okay? You go play with the kids, because you are the young master here, right?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao quickly released him. It wasn’t until then did Little Bun return to normal. His serious face finally relaxed a little. His appearance made everyone laugh. Everyone in the live broadcast room said the daughter was usually more thoughtful or her mommy, but it seemed like Little Bun was a very thoughtful boy as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it might be because Shen Yichong and Da Fu had both attended the class, they now felt a little closer to each other when they came back. In the afternoon, they discussed the current status of the film and television industry. Da Fu also shared with Shen Yichong about his creative concept of this cute pet movie. The two men deeply discussed the meaning of this subject, as well as the law of supply and demand in the market. After finding out that they each admire something about each other, their relationship was brought closer.</p>
<p>That night after the live broadcast, Shen Yichong put Yu Yaoyao to sleep. Then, he asked Shen Lin to prepare to invest in Da Fu’s production. He also asked the investment department to make a specific market survey, investment budget, and rate of return analysis.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next morning, Chen Jiao also got the news from Xu Hong. The failure of ‘Allure’ had left a scar in his relationship with Wansheng. ‘Emergency’ was still in the filming phase of shooting, and there will be at least a year before the broadcast. There would be no return in the short term.</p>
<p>“Are you sure this time that Shen Yichong has the willingness to invest?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao had some doubts about Xu Hong. If Xu Hong himself didn’t invest a portion of his personal money into ‘Allure’, he would never believe this person anymore.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Xu Hong said. “Chen Lin sent an email early in the morning asking us to investigate and analyze Shen Yichong’s investment intentions with a high degree of urgency. In the past, this kind of urgent situation had only occurred twice, and each time the work ended up being super popular. This is a project he is very optimistic about.”</p>
<p>Xu Hong also knew that his credibility was getting lower and lower. However, he had not been able to satisfy Shen Yichong in Guangxin. If he didn’t start paving his back-up road, he might be unemployed in a year. Xu Hong paused as he found that there was no reply on the other side.</p>
<p>He reassured Cheng Jiao again. “Brother Jiao, Shen Yichong must have doubted me the last time you and Wansheng snatched the investment from him. If you don’t do something this time, I might not have the chance to pass you any news in the future. Moreover, work that can be super popular will not be available every year. Even if there are any of them, you won’t get to invest in them as you pleased.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao narrowed his eyes. “Send me the completed investment feasibility analysis. I’ll reply to you after reading it.”</p>
<p>Xu Hong agreed quickly. That night, the Guangxin Investment Department worked overtime to do a market analysis of domestic and foreign film and television works related to the cute pet themes. After Xu Hong got it, he secretly sent it to Chen Jiao using his private mailbox. Almost immediately, Wansheng Investment Department also received it.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao himself did not have such a large capital that was enough to invest in a special effects film. He could only find other funding sources to cooperate. Currently, there were not many companies that had the power to quickly gain share in the film and television market.</p>
<p>After Chen Jiao sent the message, he called personally to communicate in person. But none of his calls were being answered. Whether it was a mobile phone or a work phone, they were always busy. But he soon received a response from the Wansheng Investment Department.</p>
<p>“Actor Chen, the entertainment market is expanding, and the benefit obviously cannot be taken by one company alone. Therefore, Wansheng is changing our plans and withdrawing ourselves from the competition with Guangxin. If you have other resources, feel free to contact us again. Wansheng Public Relations is currently contacting Guangxin. In the future, the two of us will adopt a cooperative attitude.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao frowned on the spot and almost kicked the chair beside him when he saw the text message.</p>
<p>Was Wansheng intimidated? Wansheng took the initiative to seek peace with Shen Yichong? This meant that they surrendered! At first, they wanted to monopolize most of the resources of the entertainment industry, but now they were obviously scared of Shen Yichong!</p>
<p>“Useless people!” Chen Jiao cursed.</p>
<p>Wansheng was indeed intimidated by now.</p>
<p>After several confrontations, both the investment department and the marketing department of Wansheng had suffered repeated losses. Their reputation in the industry plummeted, and several supervisors were scolded like they were dogs by the board of directors.</p>
<p>Wansheng was now in a terrible state. If they continued to fight against Guangxin, that was a ticket straight to hell. Hence, they decided to seek peace with Guangxin. They will try to monopolize the entertainment industry along with Guangxin and become one of the leaders in the industry, second only to Guangxin.</p>
<p>Not only did Chen Jiao’s diligence fail, but he also shared the news to Guangxin’s ‘friend’.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao didn’t expect that Wansheng would betray him. He went on to find other real estate companies that wanted to enter the entertainment industry and tried to get the investment amount.</p>
<p>However, when they contacted Da Fu, they were directly rejected by him.</p>
<p>Da Fu rejected their request without even thinking, “I have already found an investor. I will not consider other options before he gets back to me. Thank you for your appreciation.”</p>
<p>When Chen Jiao heard the news, he knew that Da Fu must be referring to Guangxin! Da Fu was Ren Sitong’s husband, and Ren Sitong was Yu Yaoyao’s best friend. With this kind of relationship, Da Fu would never betray Shen Yichong. Chen Jiao knew that he couldn’t move on with Da Fu.</p>
