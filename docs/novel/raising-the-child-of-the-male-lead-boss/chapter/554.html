            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 205 – An Unexpected Caller</strong></p>
<p>When he picked some vegetables, Yu Yaoyao didn’t stop him. On the contrary, their son ran towards him.</p>
<p>“Dad, this ingredient is more expensive than others, look, there are cheaper veggies in that section!”</p>
<p>After getting off the shopping cart, the little bun wouldn’t stop frantically running back and forth all across the store. Having compared the prices of several rows of vegetables, a sense of accomplishment was written on his little face, clear as day.</p>
<p>The little bun confidently picked up a handful of green shallots to declare: “These are the cheapest.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at his son and silently patted the little guy’s head, without a word.</p>
<p>“The money given by the program runners is enough to cover the bill. You can buy lots of meat and vegetables without the fear of overspending.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong continued to place the vegetables of his choice in the cart. However, while he wasn’t paying attention, the things he chose were sneakily placed back by Yu Yaoyao and their little bun.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “……”</p>
<p>When they arrived at the fruits section again, Yu Yaoyao directly went to hug a bunch of apples and bananas.</p>
<p><em>These are the cheapest! </em>She covered her eyes and refused to peek at her favorite strawberries as she resolutely walked away.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned and stopped in his tracks. “You continue shopping. I have a bit of work, I’ll see you two later at the billing counter.”</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, he didn’t miss the instant relief spreading across the mother-son duo. He narrowed his eyes further in suspicion, his frown deepened.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, Yu Yaoyao bravely took her son to push the cart to the checkout area, resembling a warrior walking towards the frontline that would preside over his life or death. There was fish, meat, vegetables, and fruits. Yu Yaoyao and little bun’s small faces scrunched up as they sized up the billing staff as though they were facing off the enemy troops.</p>
<p>“Hello, the bill has totaled to 282 yuan,” said the person from over the counter.</p>
<p>Their eyes immediately lit up, and they started cheering!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao wouldn’t stop grinning. “Oh, yeah! There’s still 600 yuan left!!”</p>
<p><em>Hehe, had Shen Yichong not bought such an expensive steak, the bill would’ve rounded off at 100 yuan! I’m a savings genius!</em></p>
<p>“Mommy, we did great!!” Little Bun did a thumbs up and even poked her belly solemnly.</p>
<p>“From now on, I’ll also make sure to eat more at Kindergarten so I can eat less meat in the evening!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao immediately teared up and pinched his pink cheeks in happiness. “My son is so smart!” <em>You definitely take after mommy in this aspect!!</em></p>
<p>Director Zhao, the camera crew, and a group of old people nearby were all very moved when they witnessed this heart-rending scene.</p>
<p>The dog blood scene was way too hilarious, but why did they all feel like wiping their tears?! Aiyo!</p>
<p>Though Shen Yichong was bankrupt, he had such a virtuous, flower-fairy wife who was caring and willing to endure hardship and such an intelligent, sensible son who had propriety way beyond his years. Leaving business aside, Shen Yichong surely hit the jackpot in private life!</p>
<p><em>Envious! So envious!!!</em> Director Zhao Yu wanted to chew on his handkerchief to express his swirling, bitter-sweet emotions.</p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao finished billing and happily led the little bun to find her husband, cheerfully stowing away the remaining spare change, her hands full of groceries, she found him standing at the mall entrance, waiting for them.</p>
<p>Much to her dismay, he was holding two big bags of groceries in either hand!!</p>
<p>“Husband, WHAT IS THIS?!!!”  Yu Yaoyao’s heart stopped beating, the pair of brown bags are like knives wedging in her heart. Shen Yichong, on the other hand, sported a weird expression on his face. Reaching out, he flicked the layer of sweat that had unknowingly gathered on the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>“All things you want to eat,” Shen Yichong smiled and opened the handles of the bag to let her glimpse its contents.</p>
<p>Inside were the two big pieces of steak she had forcefully stuffed away in the freezer section, and the top-grade, expensive imported vegetables that the little bun had sneakily placed back, one by one along with one or two catties of the sweet strawberries and super pricey cherries that she tended to snack on absent-mindedly while watching TV. He had even bought the shrimp with big arse heads and even heavier shells!!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t even manage to take a gasp before she quickly and painfully grasped the envelope she had carefully placed by her bosom!</p>
<p>“Husband, we can’ afford this- WE’VE RUN OUT OF MONEY!!!”<em>AHHHH!!!</em> “We’ve already used up all the money the program runners granted us!! We can’t afford any of this!!”</p>
<p><em>PLACE IT BACK, MY DEAR ANCESTOR, MY MOST BELOVED HUSBAND!!</em></p>
<p>Her face painted a picture of pained horror as she screamed in disbelief in one final attempt to convince her tyrant spouse.</p>
<p>On the side, Little Bun wilted and nodded along, expressing his agreement to Mommy’s venting. He poked his mother’s hand and glanced at her, his eyelashes trembling in sorrow. “Mommy, Dad has already checked out. Look, he has the same shopping bag like the ones we received when we finished buying.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao: “!!!!!”</p>
<p>“I swiped my personal card for this. Rest assured,” Shen Yichong clarified.</p>
<p>He was the chief breadwinner. Naturally, he couldn’t wrong his wife and son.</p>
<p>As he said that, he gazed at Yu Yaoyao. Her obviously wanting to eat but unwilling to spend money earlier, just like a squirrel storing nuts for the winter was … Unexpectedly cute. She even wanted to offer her beloved food, which she treasured beyond everything else, to him instead.</p>
<p>Thinking back, he let out a helpless chuckle.</p>
<p>“I’ll give my share of steak to you, eat it at the filming set tomorrow.”</p>
<p>He reached to ruffle her hair and continued on to give his son’s fluffy head a cherishing rub as well.</p>
<p>“Let’s head back home.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong bent down to pick his son and placed the little bun directly on either side of his shoulders.</p>
<p>One hand holding the shopping bags, he held Yu Yaoyao’s delicate hand, who still wanted to dawdle back to the exchange counter to return the groceries, with the other.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was startled. Her hands felt as though they were enclosed by a ball of fire, jolting her heart. All thoughts of wanting to return the goods went flying out of her heart and mind.</p>
<p><em>Forget it! If Shen Yichong wants to splurge on eating, let him be. He has been long accustomed to being rich and eating lots of meat every day. Sigh. He certainly can’t adapt to the sudden rift between his earnings and his standard of living just yet!!</em></p>
<p>She would have to work harder and earn more money to support the family~ She pursed her petal lips and took a look at her husband’s increasingly handsome side profile. Soon, she noticed the little bun turn his head towards her. They sighed simultaneously as they exchanged a mutual look of acquiescence.</p>
<p>‘<em>Mommy, dad is really too overbearing.’ </em>He mouthed.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao secretly nodded her head.</p>
<p><em>Yes, it’s really difficult to get him to compromise!</em> <em>Sigh!</em></p>
<p>However, right before they left the supermarket, her cellphone rang.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was distracted while communicating with her son through her eyes and answered without looking at the called ID. At once, an affectionate female voice started over the phone-</p>
<p>“Sister, you’re finally willing to answer my call~!”</p>
<p><em>Yu Xinjie!</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao‘s steps faltered and she nearly dropped her phone.</p>
<p>“F*ck, my hand slipped, I pressed the wrong button! I should’ve cut the call! Oh sh!t! FML!”</p>
<p>Yu Xinjie on the other end of the phone: “…….”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was handing the shopping bags to Chen Lin while securely holding the little bun close to himself. The corners of his mouth rose as he caught her words.</p>
<p>The confused cameraman had no idea he missed the footage of an incredibly charming smirk right behind him!</p>
