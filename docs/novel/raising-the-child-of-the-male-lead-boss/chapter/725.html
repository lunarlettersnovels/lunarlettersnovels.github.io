            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 26 – In the Spotlight</strong></p>
<p>Ni Yi refused to stop talking until they finally arrived on set to meet the cast and crew; Yu Yaoyao was already sleepy by the moment they arrived.</p>
<p>Before getting out of the car, Ni Yi helplessly took out a mirror and handed it to her. Seeing her reflection, Yu Yaoyao wiped the drool from her face and wrapped the scarf tightly before she got off. She was not one of the main cast and was admitted to the hospital just recently. Therefore, she was not called to appear on the initial shoot of the project.</p>
<p>It just so happened that when she walked in, the crew was preparing to shoot the scene between the lead actress and actor.</p>
<p>As they got closer, she was able to hear everyone’s gossip more audibly.</p>
<p>“Xinran is good-looking, has superb acting skills, and moreover, she’s unreasonably hot!”</p>
<p>“Of course!” Gossiper number 2 agreed. “How else could she have been given the role of the lead actress?”</p>
<p>But then, their conversation shifted to another person. “Still, that Yu Yaoyao’s connection is impressive; her own husband can directly invest for a film and give her the main role.”</p>
<p>The gossipmonger continued mockingly. “But with Director Li Bo here, she can only be a supporting character— Female no. 4! Plus, she’s extremely disliked by him. Hahaha! Her acting is so bad that even she can’t see it!”</p>
<p>“She’s really that bad of an actress? Didn’t she learn to act? I heard that she debuted very early.”</p>
<p>Gossiper number 1 scoffed. “What’s the use of an early debut when she only became a housewife for five years? I’m telling you, If I was the one up there, I would be able to do better—and I’m not even an actor!”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s for sure. At least you know how to read the lines!”</p>
<p>As Ni Yi listened he gnashed his teeth, and his forehead creased in anger with new sweat forming. But he really can’t refute these statements, because his sister is really … Well …</p>
<p><i>Oh no!</i></p>
<p>He secretly glanced at Yu Yaoyao’s expression and wanted to cough to announce their presence in order to break the gossip between the unsuspecting individuals. But he didn’t have to because, after a while, most of the surrounding staff members and performing groups suddenly quieted down. They unexpectedly felt that the atmosphere felt a little wrong and there was cold creeping behind their necks.</p>
<p>As soon as they looked back, they saw Yu Yaoyao standing behind them. They swallowed the words they were about to utter awkwardly, and the next second, their eyes darted open in surprise!</p>
<p>She stood there alone, but she emitted the aura of a glamorous, imposing painting!</p>
<p>Wearing a black coat left half-opened, revealed her pair of slender, long, white legs. And her feet, delicate as jade, looked especially dazzling wearing the gold high heels. At the moment, her hands were covered by a wide, bright mustard-colored scarf, and although a pair of brown sunglasses covered half of her face, they could still imagine her alluring appearance from the little bit of skin she showed. The coat also brought attention to her tiny waist, and her curly black hair was scattered behind her in rivulets.</p>
<p>This current style faintly alluded to that of an amorous and mature woman.</p>
<p>The original noisy studio suddenly became quite like dominoes that toppled one after another. Only the surrounding staff had been initially fixated with her appearance, but soon, as if a spell had been set loose, the lighting division, recording engineer, and lastly the group of directors all set their sight on her.</p>
<p>Director Li Bo, who was at the heart of the filming set and was staring at the camera, also noticed the bizarre atmosphere and looked around. The next second, his eyes stopped searching and his eyebrows immediately scrunched together.</p>
<p>His bearded face suddenly took on a seething look. “What are you gawking for?! Is this the red carpet?”</p>
<p>He brusquely shouted. “Lights, recording—where the f*ck are you looking at! We are ready to shoot, didn’t you hear me?!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao stood on the outermost perimeter but was still able to hear the director curse in anger.</p>
<p>She took her sunglasses off and cast a smile at everyone. The light reflected from her eyes like rippling waters, just like the flow of clear spring—a soft and feminine beauty that still held a trace of charm.</p>
<p>The people who caught sight of this could not help but sneak more glances.</p>
<p>Generally, an actress’s looks are above average. Their beauty on-screen should win the audience’s approval and they should hold even more allure beyond the camera.</p>
<p>The production team has long seen beautiful actresses due to this reason.</p>
<p>But perhaps because they were used to seeing pure beauties like the lead actress, Meng Xinran, that when they saw Yu Yaoyao’s different and fiery aura, they were all caught aback.</p>
<p>…  A little comparison won’t hurt. If the lead actress Meng Xinran stood next to her, her pure appearance would only pale in comparison. It would be akin to comparing a side dish to a scrumptious feast.</p>
