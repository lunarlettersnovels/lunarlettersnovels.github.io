            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 186 – Ravenous Husband (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Husband… No, please… I admit. I was wrong…” A fragrant wind immediately entered him once again. But his expression remained dull.</p>
<p><em>Then why did she think something like that?</em></p>
<p>“Actually, I just dreamed that I became a little snake… After opening my eyes, I thought you were a madman who was eating my mouth and scared me to death. I am afraid of being eaten… ”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s froze at her stupid mentality: ” … ”</p>
<p><em>She was the one who initiated it. She licked and tasted his mouth first!</em></p>
<p>“It really scared me… try touching my chest, my heart is beating really fast right now~”</p>
<p>Half of Yu Yaoyao’s body was tilted on his back, and her slender legs overlapped with his. Stretching out her small hand, she grabbed his warm one and placed it right on her chest.</p>
<p>Not long after, her dress fell off.</p>
<p>In an instant, a large white soft chest was exposed on the outside, slightly hiding inside a black-laced bra. Because of this, Shen Yichong was able to grasp her soft mounds with his bare hands.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt electrocuted by the skinship, and in the next second, he grabbed tender, well-defined shoulders, rolled her over, and pressed her against the woolen carpet.</p>
<p>The fluffy pure white carpet was a little thick and almost buried her head. However, even the pure white couldn’t cover the bright color of her skin, and the brilliant eyes on her small face.</p>
<p>“Husband, did you help me take off my clothes?” Yu Yaoyao pouted and then smiled gleefully. “You just can’t hold…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt his muscles contract and soon lowered down his head to kiss her chirping mouth.</p>
<p>Their mouths devoured each other, the scent of their bodies easily made them lose their senses. When he realized that the woman under him was almost unable to breathe, he broke the kiss and loomed over with a rare expression of affection.</p>
<p>His heart was racing at her inebriating appearance.</p>
<p>But, in the next moment, Shen Yichong frowned, and shifted his forbearing gaze elsewhere, ignoring the soft curves of she who had just recovered.</p>
<p>When he got up, he picked up a thick woolen shawl from the sofa and wrapped her with it.</p>
<p>“Go and take a hot shower first. Then lie down in bed.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s gazed down at her and helped her stand up, trying to hold her shoulders but she evaded his touch by twisting her body. Then, she stared at his glistening eyes.</p>
<p>“Ow, Husband you don’t want to eat me anymore, husband~ we can continue… the wine you secretly drank today seems to be delicious and smells great!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt the blood in his body boiling and his desire was emerging for the nth time. He tried to gather himself, pressed his temple, and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>He was always composed and rigid but what happened today surely made him lose his mind.</p>
<p>“You have worked hard today especially in the competition, take a good rest,” he said, and strode out of the bedroom.</p>
<p>When the door closed, he squeezed his fists and stood in the hallway without lights.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>That night, the finale of ‘In the Limelight’ was uploaded and Yu Yaoyao’s video performances for all challenges in the final episode became the most searched. In particular, her performance for the second challenge left those netizens who missed the live broadcast flabbergasted. They thought Yu Yaoyao was a talentless actress who debuted because of the power of her husband. But they realized they were wrong!</p>
<p>Her fans instantly grew in number. Most likely, millions of people living in China had become YYY’s fans- all because of her amazing acting skills!</p>
<p>The video received numerous reviews, and most of them were looking forward to her other shows such as ‘Youth Without Regret’ and the popular ‘My Wife and I’ which had reached the highest peak among all shows aired in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s appearance partly contributed to it because people were attracted to his taciturn yet outstanding appearance. To boot, he’s also the President of Guangxin Entertainment.</p>
<p>But not long after, there was news that rode on the coattails of the couple and was pushed to the real-time list of trending topics.</p>
<p><strong># An Entertainment announces divestment for the ‘Allure’ project, all funds are expected to be withdrawn #</strong></p>
<p>A <em>‘Shen’</em> is pulling out a huge amount of money from the movie ‘Allure’ to use it as an investment for the drama starring his wife, ‘Youth Without Regret’. It is also said that he threatened someone to give his wife the lead role for this drama. How could everyone not instantly talk about this hot topic? And thus, the internet was filled with ablaze for this speculation.</p>
<p><strong>[Withdrawing funds means you have no money. Is Shen Yichong’s mentally unstable?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[It’s okay… After all, I definitely don’t like this movie!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Guangxin has always been good at making decisions when it comes to investments, so I guess everything will be okay!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I respect his decision, he is not a well-known investor for nothing!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[He must have seen no potential from this drama.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Why not risk your money for this one? After all, you are one of the richest people in China!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen please slap them in the face with your excessive money!]  </strong></p>
<p><strong>[I read the book ‘Allure’ and it’s nice but I hope the adaptation is good too. That might be one of the reasons Mr. Shen withdrew the investment.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Maybe he hates someone from the production crew… or, perhaps for personal reasons… still we have no idea…]</strong></p>
<p>In less than an hour, another breaking news proved Shen Yichong’s decision this time wrong.</p>
<p><strong># ‘Allure’ production crew congratulates director Qiao Anni, who won the Best Director Award at the 42nd Savi International Film Festival today! #</strong></p>
<p><strong># ‘Allure’ is slated to be released after a month, both male and female actors are the ones who made this drama successful! #</strong></p>
<p><strong># ‘Allure’ receives 100 million yuan investment from Wansheng Group, and is expected to create the most amazing oriental fantasy movie ever! #</strong></p>
<p><strong>[*</strong><em><strong>Raised eyebrow emoji*…</strong></em><strong> For real!?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[F*ck! Guangxin Entertainment’s divestment this time… FAILED!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen, this is embarrassing!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[What he said during the finale of ‘In the Limelight’ is real, right? Really? Did he run out of money!?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I wonder if this news is just to destroy Guangxin Entertainment!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The couple’s popularity right now is being hoisted to the top by this fake news!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Will always support Guangxin. Who knows the show ‘Youth Without Regret’ will be much more popular than ‘Allure’ and will benefit Guangxin more…]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[No! My richest CEO, is this a joke?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This is fake news, right?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[To break the couple’s happiness, bashers must have done this!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[To think that the Boss whom everyone fears is a failure! HAHAHA!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You and your family should now leave the entertainment industry! LOSERS!!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[No money, no fame!]</strong></p>
