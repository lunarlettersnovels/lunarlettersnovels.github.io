        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 83 – He’s a Mama’s Boy</strong></p>
<p>“You used to walk with big strides, and your slippers sound so loud. Why is it different today?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong almost laughed in anger. He had wanted to see what his son was doing without disturbing him, so he naturally tiptoed his way around towards him.</p>
<p>What does he mean his slippers used to sound so loud?</p>
<p>“Are you unhappy when dad is around?”</p>
<p>The little steamed bun didn’t realize that his words had sourly stabbed his father right at the heart. He nodded without hesitation, his little mouth pursued to a downward arc. In a bitter tone, he lamented, “I miss my mommy,” and placed his arms comfortingly around the white snake doll, hugging it a little tighter.</p>
<p>The corners of Shen Yichong’s mouth immediately twitched.</p>
<p>The steamed bun has long been tired of playing with toys such as dolls and figurines at home. Even more so with plushies that he felt only little girls should touch. Therefore, the four years old was not willing to touch any of it.</p>
<p>But now…with this big, white snake plushie, he actually held something he used to steer off for two days without letting go. There was even one morning where he wanted to take it to the kindergarten, of which Shen Yichong had refused—but the steamed bun actually cried!</p>
<p>Just because his mother had bought it.</p>
<p>Now, every day he eagerly, almost impatiently, waits for his mother to come home. As if he had to go on a look-out every day!</p>
<p>“Shen Rui,” he started. “What about Dad?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong only felt a burst of chest pain assault him. In just a few days, his position in his son’s heart had rapidly declined all of the sudden. In the past five years, he had always spared time to play with him; he paid for the expensive toys—the cars, numerous trains and different air planes just for him.</p>
<p><em>This heartless little thing!</em></p>
<p>“You only want your mother, not your father?” Shen Yichong’s eyebrows screwed together heavily.</p>
<p>But the steamed bun was only ignorant of his father’s broken thought at the moment. He quickly raised his head and gave his dad a helpless look.</p>
<p><em>Dad really gets easily jealous!</em></p>
<p>“Dad, you have the same schedule every day. You to go to work and go home at the same time—I have already memorized it.” The steamed bun explained.</p>
<p>He truly was jealous of his dad. His dad has a fixed schedule for work than his mommy. And to add, no one bullies his dad at work.</p>
<p>“Dad, mommy is different from you.” The small, steamed bun holding the big white snake, faced his little ass to his father and turned away from the table filled with toys.</p>
<p>As his two, fat feet stepped on the carpet, he raised his head, intending to seriously educate his ignorant father. “Mommy cries if she eats less. If she gets cold—she will also cry. And if she has headache or feel pain. Also, if she is bullied by many strangers, she will definitely feel sad and cry.”</p>
<p>The little steamed bun stretched out a finger and poked the big, white snake plushie in his arms. “Daddy, mommy is very fragile.” After a while, he added, a hint of blush appearing on his cheeks as he shamefully said, “I am too young to protect my mommy. I can only worry about her.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt arrow after arrow hit his chest in succession.</p>
<p>This current appearance of his son being a mommy’s boy and acting sensible made his chest stuffier. Moreover, his son’s youthful face which was fair, round and tender, was a complete copy of Yu Yaoyao. His pair of slightly slanted but round eyes, is also inherited from his mother…and also his long and curved eyelashes that made his eyes pop as if he was wearing eyeliner is also something from Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Perhaps his son was born a mommy’s boy from the beginning—it was destined that he was to turn away from his father!</p>
<p>“Dad can’t be cold? Dad can’t be hungry?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was really caught off-guard today. He looked at his son, but the small steamed bun only turned his back to him, face down on the table to write. His small face frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“Are you only worried about your mother? Can’t your dad have a cold or become hungry like your mother?”</p>
<p>The little steamed bun turned around, with a speechless expression on his little face, saying: <em>‘Dad, please stop that now’.</em></p>
<p>“Dad, don’t you have uncle Chen Lin? When you want something, why not just tell uncle Lin? And dad, it’s not your first day at work like mommy. Uncle Lin also said that everyone in the company is afraid of you.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun puffed up his cheeks and looked at his father with an indignant expression.</p>
<p>His dad thought he didn’t know?</p>
<p>Obviously, with his dad as the boss, he is the biggest man in the company—no one would dare fight him. And now faced with his dad’s unexpected sour face, as if he had been bullied—the small steamed bun could now really confirm his dad is a big, jealous man!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyebrows pressed together at this reply, “Your mother also has your uncle Ni Yi beside her.”</p>
<p>The small steamed bun pouted, about to speak, but suddenly he climbed down from his seat with a whoosh. Like a little dog, he raised his head and ears, intently listening to the sound outside the room.</p>
<p><em>Someone opened the door; someone came inside the house!</em></p>
