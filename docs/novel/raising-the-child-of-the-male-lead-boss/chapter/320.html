            <p><strong>Chapter 443</strong></p>
<p>What Little Bun said almost shattered Chen Jiao’s dignity. Moreover, he soon discovered that Little Bun was also ignoring him. Little Bun just turned around and started writing and drawing on his tablet. Chen Jiao stood there feeling embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Xiao Rui, uncle had no experience before, that’s why I didn’t succeed. Then… I’ll sweep the floor now.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao knew that they were on a live broadcast, and he also knew that the program group would later edit the clips before broadcasting the show. If he didn’t perform well, he would definitely be criticized by the audience. Now that the Internet carried a strong power, celebrities could be harshly criticized even if they were only a little careless.</p>
<p>So, he had no choice but to attend to his task of sweeping and mopping the floor. After finishing the first floor, he even went sweeping outside. He even wiped the table after cleaning the floor. Fortunately, he worked out often, so he wasn’t too tired.</p>
<p>But Little Bun was not going to let him off easily. He kept doing inspections while holding the live camera.</p>
<p>He ran his little finger across the table Chen Jiao had just wiped and said , “There is still dust here, uncle.”</p>
<p>Then, he looked at the ground and picked up a strand of hair, “The floor is not clean either,” Then as an afterthought, “Bad rating for you!”</p>
<p>The Little Bun came to a conclusion mercilessly.</p>
<p>“Uncle, do you do the same when you film TV programs? You don’t put serious effort into them? Last time I saw people saying that an actor played a role like he was taking in a photoshoot. Whether his character was supposed to be happy, shocked, or sad, he always had the same expression…right?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao: “…”</p>
<p>He wouldn’t mind what the kid said! But his temple felt so painful!</p>
<p>Little Bun Shen Rui was still unwilling to let him off. Facing a person who bullied his mommy and little sister, he, as the young man in the family, must not let this off easily! He must avenge his mommy and little sister!</p>
<p>“Uncle, I heard that you were the winner of the best actor award, but you don’t seem to have won the award this year?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao was stabbed straight in his chest. “Um, that’s because there are uncles who did better this year. Everyone’s performances are equally wonderful.”</p>
<p>He took a deep breath and told himself not to be bothered by what this little kid said. This kid probably didn’t even know what a best actor meant!</p>
<p>“In history, people who’ve won the best actor award more than twice… Well, let me do the math…”</p>
<p>But Little Bun interrupted him. “Hmm..it seems like Uncle hasn’t won an award for years now? I heard.. not even the best supporting actor award?” he began, “My daddy always said that if you don’t advance against the current, you will retreat. Could he be referring to people like you…? You’ll only regress if you don’t work hard enough. Then, you won’t get the best actor award, nor the best supporting actor award.”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s face turned red. Not winning an award for consecutive years was exactly something that he started to panic about. He had never told anyone that, but it was pointed out by a little kid!</p>
<p>When he was in Guangxin, Shen Yichong had suggested that he should shoot a criminal investigation film with strong logic. However, he did not accept it because the protagonist’s image did not match his fans’ preferences. But later, the actor in this film had actually won the best actor award!</p>
<p>In the following year, when Shen Yichong gave him several art films to choose from, he still went with commercial films regardless.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao always felt that winning the best actor award once was enough. He thought there wasn’t a need for him to prove his acting skills through shooting art films that only had a very small audience group, which at the end would only be people’s joke if he didn’t win an award.</p>
<p>He had even felt that Shen Yichong was restricting him from picking up the role as a spokesperson for brands, as well as making commercial films and romance films, which he thought were curbing his development.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until this year when he set up his own studio did he understand Shen Yichong’s suggestion.</p>
<p>His acting skills had no problem, but he had fixed his character too early for always shooting in commercial films with similar roles and genres. Due to that, award judges and major directors were not very fond of him.</p>
<p>Although the first two years were still okay, he had lost a lot of fans this year. The little girls who used to like him had grown up, but he was still standing at the same spot, not taking on deeper roles. Since he could not catch up with their growth, a good amount of fans had left the fandom. And logically, he wouldn’t gain much younger fans now because they would fall for some other actors that were younger than him.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to admit that he had reached an awkward period!</p>
<p>Chen Jiao clenched his fists as he thought. After he realized this problem this year, he picked up a role in a criminal investigation film. He also tried different roles with a historical battle film.</p>
<p>“Xiao Rui, Uncle has worked hard this year. I have two movies releasing around the Spring Festival.”</p>
<p>Next year, he’s aiming for the awards! Even if he couldn’t get an award, the two unreleased films must at least become a hit. He aimed to be a box office pillar in the industry.</p>
<p>Otherwise, his studio would have nothing that can be compared to the other companies. With lesser finance, resources, and talent pool, how can the company survive in the competitive industry?!</p>
