            <p><strong>Chapter 330 – Secret Acting Skills (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>When Yu Yaoyao’s script fell to the ground, the page she had been reading for most of the day was revealed. Because she was removing her makeup, she couldn’t pick it up herself.</p>
<p>Being a gentleman, Wei Ming bent down and got it for her, “Here.”</p>
<p>The hand he reached out to take the script froze. Wei Ming only glanced down at the paper, but he saw the dense notes written on it. His mouth opened in astonishment. He looked at Yu Yaoyao’s delicate little face that was gradually being revealed as her makeup was being removed.</p>
<p>“Brother Wei?” Yu Yaoyao wanted to take her script back, but Wei Ming’s hand was tightly squeezed around it.</p>
<p>Stunned and partly dazed, Wei Ming stretched out his other hand after a long pause and pointed to the page in his hand. “Did you write this? These are your notes?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had acted with Wei Ming before. Wei Ming had thought that even her act of looking at him while they were shooting was superb. But looking back, he had also felt a little strange.</p>
<p>She had played a small role in which he had slayed her. In the last scene of a dream, she had been laying in his arms, asking why he hadn’t come to see her.</p>
<p>Director Li Bo had praised her for the resentment and hatred she had shown in her eyes, as well as the trace of unwillingness and regret. Her acting skills were on point all the time, and the look had undoubtedly been the finishing touch to the explosion of her acting.</p>
<p>However, Wei Ming, as the person always being stared at, felt that Yu Yaoyao treated him like food that was trying to escape, looking as if she was going to eat him up… She looked like she was about to crush every single bone in his body and swallow him up… The hidden trace of brutality in her eyes seemed as though it could escape at any given time.</p>
<p>Looking back, Wei Ming still felt a little intimidated.</p>
<p>He had almost gotten an NG.</p>
<p>In the end, he had relied on his years of experience and abruptly avoided her gaze. He had then acted the scene in which he had expressed the emperor’s guilty conscience.</p>
<p>When it was broadcasted on TV later, he had waited in front of his own TV and watched it. He had wanted to re-watch his performance and Yu Yaoyao’s sharp gaze as a member of the audience. He found that she had portrayed the grievances of a dying person perfectly. It was almost impossible to find any critical faults.</p>
<p>Wei Ming had thought he was overthinking it.</p>
<p>But today, when he looked down at the script in his hand, he couldn’t help but shake his head.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Lu Cheng asked curiously and moved closer. His mouth changed to an O-shape and he also became speechless.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was holding makeup remover and wiping off her lipstick, she could only stare at them blankly from the mirror. “I wrote it,” she felt weird saying it. “Why? Is there something wrong with it?”</p>
<p>Wei Ming and Lu Cheng both raised their heads and looked at her with an indescribable, complex expression.</p>
<p>Of course, it was wrong!</p>
<p>It was very wrong!</p>
<p>They no longer knew how to evaluate her or her performances after looking at the script. Yu Yaoyao’s current role had a decent amount of inner turmoil.</p>
<p>She used to be beautiful and young. But after getting married, she worked as a full-time wife for seven years. She was surrounded only by her child and the cooking ingredients in her house. Her youth went into waste.</p>
<p>After being cheated on and divorced by her husband, her sheltered bubble had collapsed. She kept failing while she tried to get a decent job in the outside world. She had only found work as a waitress in a restaurant, but the meager salary was not enough to cover the medical expenses of her seriously ill child.</p>
<p>And when her husband had remarried a young secretary, he acted as if he couldn’t wait to get rid of the burden that was his wife and child. Even the division of their assets had been unfair.</p>
<p>She could appeal, but her child didn’t have the time to wait. Then came the scene of desperation in which she lit the cigarette in the rain. She sucked all the pain into her lungs like a shadow in the last trace of smoke and rain.</p>
<p>But the notes written on her script were nothing like that.</p>
<p>“For the part of ‘you found a lighter but not a cigarette on you’, your note is…” the finger Wei Ming was pointing to the paper was shaking. He lowered his head, his throat constricted.</p>
<p>She’d written:</p>
<p><em>-The saddest thing in the world is when I can’t find a straw when I have a cup of boba milk tea in my hand.</em></p>
<p><em>-What a sad life! Should I tear it open to drink or go back and ask the store for a straw?!</em></p>
<p><em>-It rained before I even came to an answer… I tore off the cover, the rain fell in, the milk tea was all ruined… It took me half an hour to walk home, and by then the hot boba was all cold!</em></p>
<p><em>-God! Freaking God! No, I can’t blame God for this. I can only blame myself for not taking a straw. I should have checked before I left! I am an idiot! I should blame myself for being stupid!</em></p>
<p><em>-I’m sorry, my boba… I have let you down!</em></p>
<p>The densely packed words barely fit on the script.</p>
<p>She’d even pasted a sticky note. On here she had written the knowledge she learned from the textbook.</p>
<p><em>-Close shot, with hidden and revealing expressions.</em></p>
<p><em>Hidden: I was hurt like never before. I became really depressed because of my boba!</em></p>
<p><em>Revealing: I can’t find my freaking straw… Urgent! Shame!</em></p>
<p>Wei Ming swallowed heavily. He did not know how to express his feelings even when he got to the end.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao merely glanced at the place he was pointing to before she let out an ‘oh.’ She blushed slightly. “Um… I have never smoked before, so I couldn’t imagine it. I had to replace it with something else. I asked Sister Cai, and she said that smoking is considered an escape or an attempt to numb oneself. I gave it a thought. I found that I like to have sweets whenever I feel sad,” she said. “The only thing I found to compare to not being able to find a cigarette when you have a lighter, is when you don’t have a straw when you have your boba with you. It was really depressing!”</p>
