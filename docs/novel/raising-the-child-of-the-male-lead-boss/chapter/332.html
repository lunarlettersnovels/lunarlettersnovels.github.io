<p><strong>Chapter 431</strong></p>
<p>As soon as the award-presenter’s voice fell, the YY fans got extremely thrilled instantly!</p>
<p><em>[Yeayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Congratulations Yaoyao!]</em></p>
<p><em>[A gift for her second baby!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Thanks to the judges! You guys have great taste!]</em></p>
<p>The award-presenter’s voice soon followed, “We selected a few compliments from the organizing committee and the judges to share with you.”</p>
<p>“The female character played by Yu Yaoyao is a sign of the times. It revealed to us how a woman that has fallen into a trough and lost her haven could still own so much power, just because she is a mother and a woman who refuses to admit defeat.”</p>
<p>“In the play, she’s shed tears three times, which carried different meanings for each of them. She portrayed the character vividly, as if it had come to life.”</p>
<p>“Toughness, hesitation, weak, strong, forbearance, pain, happiness… All these appeared in her eyes at the same time. She has really amazing acting skills!”</p>
<p>The YY fans were excitedly expressing their agreement through typing on their keyboards.</p>
<p>“It’s very regretful that she can’t come to the scene today because she’s about to be a mother for the second time. On behalf of all our colleagues and the audience, I would like to congratulate her in advance.”</p>
<p>The award-presenter smiled.</p>
<p>“But there is still good news. Just now when the award result was announced, our organizer called her, and the call seems to have been connected. Could the staff on-site please help us get on the line with her?”</p>
<p>The YY fans who thought they would only be able to see the video recorded in advance all got extremely excited.</p>
<p>When the award-presenter was in the process of getting on a call with Yu Yaoyao, she also invited director Qi Hang to accept the award on behalf of Yu Yaoyao. He was then invited to stay on stage while they waited to get connected with Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Jiao in the audience took on a ghastly expression. He wasn’t surprised that Yu Yaoyao won the best supporting actress award. He had watched the movie and felt that her performance was above the expectations.</p>
<p>However, he still felt extremely uncomfortable in his heart. Both the best supporting actor and best supporting actress were all Guangxin artists. After thinking for a while, he immediately realized that artists from Guangxin were also nominated in the best actor and best actress awards later.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao gritted his teeth. Guangxin’s investment projects were also nominated for the best film award. As for the best director award, Zhou Zhuan, as one of the most popular nominees, had had a very close friendship with Shen Yichong for a very long time. The dark horse, Qi Hang, was also a legend in the industry which had a good relationship with Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, Guangxin… They were just like ghosts that were following him everywhere! Did he really have good eyes, or was he purely lucky?</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s expression was getting uglier as he looked on the stage.</p>
<p>Thinking about it carefully, Shen Yichong had always had good luck, but it seemed to have gotten even better recently.</p>
<p>He followed Yu Yaoyao everywhere, and he kept visiting her at the crews. This helped him build connections with the dark horse directors and newcomers in the industry who had great potential. More or less, it would leave them with a good impression of Guangxin.</p>
<p>This time, he also got to invest in Da Fu’s thanks to Yu Yaoyao. If it weren’t for her relationship with Ren Si Tong, Shen Yichong and Da Fu would never get to know each other. The investment from him or Shen Yichong would have been the same to Da Fu without any bias. If it were not for Yu Yaoyao, Da Fu wouldn’t have been so loyal to Shen Yichong!</p>
<p>And this was just one of the things.</p>
<p>The producer of the previous web drama ‘Youth Without Regrets’, including the director of ‘In the Limelight’, Zhao Yu… Shen Yichong had benefited from all of these because of Yu Yaoyao. Recently, Zhao Yu was doing a brand-new outdoor reality show.</p>
<p>With ‘In the Limelight’, ‘My Wife and I’, and ‘Welcome to My House’, Zhao Yu was now a hot chip in the variety industry. Several entertainment companies also wanted to send their newcomers into his new outdoor reality show.</p>
<p>Originally, even Chen Jiao wanted to send his newcomers there after hearing about it. But Zhao Yu turned him down!</p>
<p>Instead, he invited two newcomers of Guangxin, who were Qiu Dajian that appeared in ‘Youth Without Regrets’ and became popular, and Zhao Xiaomeng, who had a good relationship with Yu Yaoyao through ‘In the Limelight’. Zhao Yu’s selection this time gave so much dignity to Shen Yichong.</p>
<p>Although he seemed to take care of Guangxin very much, God knew what exchange terms they had reached behind the scenes.</p>
<p>As Chen Jiao thought, the corner of his mouth twitched uncomfortably.</p>
<p>Most likely, Yu Yaoyao had only become a guest of ‘Welcome to My Home’ because of Shen Yichong’s condition with Zhao Yu.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao squeezed his fist. If Ling Shuang had not misled him at the time, none of these benefits would have fallen to Shen Yichong today.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao..she belonged to him. It was Shen Yichong who took away his lucky star!</p>
<p>The more Chen Jiao thought about it, the gloomier his expression became. But the camera was not targeting him at this time.</p>
<p>The call was finally connected! Not sure what happened just now, but the call that the director had dialed was hung up for a while. The second call finally got through.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Holding the microphone, Qi Hang greeted with a smile on his face. “Xiao Yao? Are you watching our live broadcast at home?”</p>
