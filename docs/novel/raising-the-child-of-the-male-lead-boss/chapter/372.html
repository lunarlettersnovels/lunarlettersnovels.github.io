            <p><strong>Chapter 391</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>“Loyal fan?” Yu Yaoyao said after applying a mask to her face. She opened Weibo to take a look for herself. “Oh, ‘My wife is doing pretty good lately’? I remember him. He helped me last time as well.”</p>
<p>He was the one who showed the shameless Meng Xinran’s true colors and impressed Yu Yaoyao deeply with his short essay.</p>
<p>She quickly read over the newly written post. “Hmmm, the style…”</p>
<p>It was so familiar to her, she felt like she had seen it somewhere before. But it wasn’t the same as back then during the Meng Xiaohua incident.</p>
<p>While Yu Yaoyao was trying to figure it out, Ni Yi continued speaking, “Sis, the director of ‘I’m Just a Killer’ wants to meet you for a private audition. While Guangxian has invested in this project and we still have the final say, the director is worried you might not be able to act murderously enough. That’s why he wants to meet you in person. He said he could at least help you if you struggle with it. Since the crew is all going through a preparation period, perhaps you could do some homework to get a feel for the role?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her eyebrows. “Murderously enough?” she said with a shrug. “Alright, arrange the meeting. Any day except the weekends.”</p>
<p>She reserved the weekends to spend time with Little Bun and her husband.</p>
<p>“Alright. Another thing, there are a lot of action scenes in this movie. The director wants to know if you want to use a stunt double or do it yourself? If you do want to do it yourself, do you want to do everything yourself or just part of it?”</p>
<p>The choice to do her own stunts was the treatment from a sponsor. Ordinarily, actresses didn’t have much of a say when it came to things like this.</p>
<p>“He will explain the action plots and scenes to you in the meeting. We will need to build some more muscle and shape your body a bit more.” This was the main point Ni Yi wanted to make. “I already found a personal trainer for you. I told him you need a specialized training and meal plan.”</p>
<p>“Muscle?” Yu Yaoyao was shocked for a moment. She hadn’t looked at the details when she’d chosen the script. “People do that these days?”</p>
<p>“Sis…You’re a killer,” Ni Yi said.</p>
<p>“Okay then…” Yu Yaoyao replied slowly.</p>
<p>Ni Yi wiped at the sweat collecting on his forehead. “Going on the filming time for ‘Youth’, you will still be shooting the drama for another month. But it won’t matter if you start showing some muscle during that time. You’re going to be a master chef with impeccable cooking skills. I don’t think it will be a problem if you tone your body a little.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi sent Yu Yaoyao the timetable soon as they’d hung up the call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meet with the fitness trainer.</li>
<li>Daily training schedule.</li>
<li>Daily meal plan.</li>
<li>Meet with the new director.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yu Yaoyao threw herself into Shen Yichong’s arms when she saw it. All she had wanted was a second child. She had no idea the play would be so complicated.</p>
<p>With everything going on, she forgot all about the Weibo account ‘My wife is doing pretty good lately’.</p>
<p>“Darling, will I be ugly if I build more muscle?” she asked.</p>
<p>Then she searched the Internet and found several women who looked like muscular barbies. This was so far away from what she considered in line with her aesthetics.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong patted her head helplessly. “Muscle toning isn’t easy for women. I think in your case, you’ll only get abs and shed your excess weight.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao suddenly panicked. She grabbed her upper arm in horror. “No, never. How is it possible that I have extra fat under my arms?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled and squeezed under her armpit. “So soft.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt like she had been hit by a bolt from the blue. She really had to lose some weight.</p>
<p>But she wasn’t the only one having issues. Chen Cheng from the Wansheng Film and Television Investment Department had problems of his own.</p>
<p>He was furious with the director of the Marketing Department and the director of the Public Relations Department. But since they were all on the same level, he had to control his temper.</p>
<p>“You guys said that even if it was difficult to bring Yu Yaoyao down, you would have no problem creating some public issue to make her lose fans or force her to lay low for a while. Now, we are the ones who have to keep a low profile!” Chen Cheng said sarcastically.</p>
<p>“Didn’t we do that to cooperate with the pace of the Investment Department?” The head of the Marketing Department challenged. “In the meeting with the board of directors, you said you wanted to find an actress who could beat Yu Yaoyao, and you wanted full support from the Film and Television Department. There is no such person in the market right now. The only way we could achieve that is to either make a person popular, or to backslash our opponent. Our boss asked us to assist you through any means.”</p>
<p>Chen Cheng’s eyes widened. “And were you successful in your backlashing task?”</p>
<p>While the other two were worked up, the director of the Public Relations Department was quite relaxed. “Come now, don’t fight. Right now, our top priority is to prevent people from finding out that Wansheng is behind all this. Before I forget, I asked someone to check the IP address of the account that helped Yu Yaoyao. If necessary, we can get a few marketing accounts to intervene.”</p>
<p>The loyal fan of Yu Yaoyao had knocked out all the accounts from the marketing department in one go.</p>
<p>This was not the first time that Wansheng had bought a hot search, but it was the first time they got such a terrible result. Not even the Investment Department’s Marketing Department could believe it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long until the results of the investigation came out.</p>
<p>The text message the director of the Public Relations Department received from his subordinate was enough to give him an instant headache; the IP address of ID ‘My wife is doing pretty good lately’ had a 4% overlap with Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao’s IP address.</p>
<p>“It’s their subaccount. To be more precise, it’s Shen Yichong’s subaccount!”</p>
<p>Chen Cheng almost spat out a sip of tea. “What the… Is Shen Yichong a monster?”</p>
<p>He lost to him in his investment decisions.</p>
<p>He lost to him again trying to create a hotspot with fake accounts.</p>
<p>“Do we still want to continue this fight with them?” This whole thing was giving the director of Public Relations a headache.</p>
<p>The fake accounts were all useless now.</p>
<p>If they wanted to continue this fight, they needed an interesting scandal, money to buy manpower for fake accounts, and time to build the fake accounts to make noise about Yu Yaoyao’s scandal… All this was impossible in a short-term perspective.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng was speechless. It wasn’t that they didn’t have enough manpower, it was that their enemy was too strong.</p>
