            <p><strong>Chapter 392</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>The YY official fan group was also looking for Yu Yaoyao’s loyal fan.</p>
<p>In just a few hours, the admins from various fan clubs and many other fans had all sent private messages to the ID ‘My wife is doing good these days.”</p>
<p><em>[Hey, you seem very promising. Do you want to join the fan club? The discount code is…]</em></p>
<p><em>[You’re part of the family since you also like our Yaoyao. Bro, I’m following you!]</em></p>
<p><em>[You are very talented, and our organization values you. Please, be the vice president of the fan club!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I think you do a much better job than Guangxin Public Relations. Are you considering becoming our Yaoyao’s personal Public Relations officer?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Let’s do a crowdfunding and buy a computer for our dude so he can continue to attack the enemy!]</em></p>
<p>All the fans were convinced the owner of the account was someone with strong logic and a solid background and knowledge of the Internet. How could an ordinary person write a counterattack so quickly? He also seemed to have found out that Wansheng was behind all this!</p>
<p>The fans were all surprised when several famous educational institutions posted their support for Yu Yaoyao and her web drama.</p>
<p><em>[Lantian Driving School: Youth, dare to work hard and learn endlessly!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Long Xiang Cooking School: Want to be a chef like Qian Duoduo? As long as you are willing to put in the work, and love food like her, nothing is impossible!]</em></p>
<p>There were even a bunch of tutoring institutions following the trend:</p>
<p><em>[If you want good grades, come and sign up for a one-to-five tutoring class!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Even a bad student like Qian Duoduo could come back in the end! Sign up now for a special price. Nothing is impossible!]</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong never expected such a trend to start, let alone Wansheng.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao even received a bunch of invitations from the tutoring companies to be their spokesperson. This was quite surprising to Guangxin’s Marketing Department.</p>
<p>Usually, actresses were only ever invited to be the spokesperson for weight loss, beauty, and makeup advertisements. None of them had ever become a spokesperson for a tutoring institution! Furthermore, Yu Yaoyao was a married woman who had left school a long time ago. But seemingly overnight, she had become the star of the education industry.</p>
<p>The director of the Marketing Department consulted Shen Yichong personally on the matter, “Shall we make use of the trend to promote the ‘upright and hungry for knowledge’ character of Teacher Yu?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched in thought, and he looked to his wife as he listened to what the director had to say.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who was supposedly upright and hungry for knowledge, was now rolling around on the sofa like a caterpillar. Even though she had said she wanted to lose weight, she was stuffing the so-called low-calorie beef jerky into her mouth. When she realized Shen Yichong was watching her, she smiled shyly.</p>
<p>Then she slowly stretched out a hand and stuffed a piece of the jerky into his mouth. It was like she was trying to turn him into an ally so her actions wouldn’t be condemned.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong grinned as he bit the beef.</p>
<p>“No need,” he said to the Marketing Team, rejecting their proposal. “That was nothing but a role.”</p>
<p>His wife was someone who just loved to spend most of her free time lying down.</p>
<p>While the director of the Marketing Department felt it was a missed opportunity and quite a shame, he couldn’t argue with his boss.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long until the score of Yu Yaoyao’s web drama, ‘Youth’, rose again. Through this wave of reversal hot searches, it surpassed even the original record and reached a high score of 85 points.</p>
<p>The official website also removed all the data of the accounts that left bad reviews. Coupled with the influx of new audiences that came out of curiosity, the score of the web drama immediately reversed for the better.</p>
<p>When Chen Jiao saw this sudden change, he was overcome with a complex wave of emotions he couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was no longer the weak and helpless girl he once knew. She was strong now.</p>
<p>Even though she had received so much backlash from the fake accounts, she was able to quickly resolve it. It hadn’t even taken her a day. Putting aside Guangxin’s power, a large part of it was due to her strong charm that attracted many loyal fans.</p>
<p>In the modern entertainment industry, she had obviously found her place. Ordinary people could no longer compete with or threaten that.</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s heart was gripped by a sense of pride and joy, as well as a sense of indescribable loss and discomfort.</p>
<p>It had taken him four years before he became the protagonist of the box office; and it hadn’t taken Yu Yaoyao long at all…</p>
<p>He wasn’t even sure he could best her in acting.</p>
<p>Even though he was feeling all this, Chen Jiao’s expression was unreadable.</p>
<p>But in the end, he still managed to convince himself that if he were to be in a relationship with Yu Yaoyao, there had to be a negative impact on the fan base.</p>
<p>The stronger she was now, the less she had to rely on Shen Yichong. Through this, the influence would be minimized.</p>
<p>Before he went to the crew to film, he took another look at the divorce agreement between Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao. This instantly made him feel much better.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao took the time and agreed to meet Liang Yujie, the director of ‘I’m A Killer’.</p>
<p>Liang Yujie also invited the screenwriter, Liu Yazhi. Since their collaboration in ‘Chaos’, Liu Yazhi had always favored Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Before attending the meeting, Liang Yujie was actually a little worried about Yu Yaoyao’s positioning. It was solely for the sake of Guangxin’s huge investment that he’d decided to let Yu Yaoyao give it a try. While it was true that she was popular and her acting skills were great, which made her unlikely to mess up the movie, the role of a killer was very different from that of a bad girl.</p>
<p>But the screenwriter, Liu Yazhi, had nothing but praise for Yu Yaoyao. She showed Liang Yujie just how confident she was in Yu Yaoyao and had nothing but good things to say about her.</p>
<p>When she learned that Yu Yaoyao was interested in the script she had written five years ago and wanted to star in it, she felt like she was her soulmate.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Xiao Yao, let’s just have a nice casual chat. I believe you will do well in this role; you are the heroine of my heart after all,” Liu Yazhi said.</p>
<p>Liang Yujie was speechless. Clearly this screenwriter was unreliable. It seemed it was all down to him now. “Teacher Yu… Have you read any martial arts novels before? Do you know what the authors mean when they refer to murderousness? And please, I don’t want you to take offense to this question, but have you ever killed a chicken?”</p>
