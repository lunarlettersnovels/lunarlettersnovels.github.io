<p><strong>Chapter 343</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>The YY fans, who had been following and criticizing ‘Old Iron Art’, could never have expected such a sudden change in his attitude. The speed at which he changed his statement was so extreme that the fans struggled to keep up!</p>
<p>From his previous post to the most recent, it appeared as though he had been extremely surprised by the trainee from the photoshoot of five years ago. From what the fans could piece together, said trainee had come in launched a type of counterattack.</p>
<p>They were elated, and rushed to the comment section as fast as they could:</p>
<p><em>[Gosh! Old Iron, you really bowed down in record time.]</em></p>
<p><em>[I actually came here with the intention of scolding you, but… Seeing as though you have admitted your mistake, I think I can forgive you.]</em></p>
<p><em>[I’ll spare your life! But tell me, is my sister your model? Give me some sort of secret sign.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Y’all, seeing as though his attitude changed in such a short time, it must be our sister. I bet I’m not wrong!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Hehe, I won’t say anything. I’ll just wait for the cover of the magazine! Consider me eagerly awaiting the photos!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Does your face hurt from that proverbial slap? Ha!]</em></p>
<p>When this whole photoshoot story had first come out, the YY fans had been furious. They originally hadn’t wanted to buy the magazine and boost the company’s sales. But now, they were satisfied. Without a doubt, they wanted to support Yu Yaoyao and couldn’t wait until the magazine was finally released.</p>
<p><em>[Looking forward to it! I want to see the slap in the face my sister gave him]</em></p>
<p><em>[Hehe, once again my sister proves herself! I have to buy one to support her!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I wonder how our sister was sitting when she gave him that thrashing. She must have looked absolutely gorgeous, right?]</em></p>
<p>Because the YY fans were getting heated and antsy, the ‘Beauty’ magazine succumbed to the press and released Yu Yaoyao’s final, refined photos as soon as was possible.</p>
<p>There were two in total.</p>
<p>In one of them, she was standing in a cold, steel city. She looked like a trapped beast trying to break out of its cage. In the other, she looked like a pure, naïve deer in the forest, hiding behind a tree. She only showed half her fairy-like face in the photo, as though she was afraid that people were going to find her.</p>
<p>Soon, proud experts such as famous fashionistas and photographers were praising the content:</p>
<p><em>[BarbaFashionV: She is an absolute darling under the lighting. And just look at that aura! She seems to be just standing casually, but every part of her body makes me feel as if a story is being told. I have fallen in love with her charming personality.]</em></p>
<p><em>[MiddlenightteacherV: The beauty of her face is suffocating. Even with the magnified details of her face, one can see it is sharp and curvy. She is perfectly slim, no fat on her at all. She moves so naturally under the lighting. Every micro-expression on her is just so reminiscing.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Collisonv: A person with a thousand different faces.]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr.ChenD: Not everyone is good at showing fashion, but she obviously is one of the people who can!]</em></p>
<p>The YY fans were overjoyed with the abundance of compliments. So much so, that they ran out of ideas on how to praise Yu Yaoyao. People kept asking when the magazine would be released. YY fans liked every single post that praised Yu Yaoyao. They truly were enjoying the busyness and attention.</p>
<p>But the one person they were waiting for, Yu Yaoyao, was still not active on Weibo. Only Yu Yaoyao’s manager updated her Weibo to thank all the studio staff that were present for the shooting.</p>
<p>Although everyone was still hungry for Yu Yaoyao’s updates, they had two photos that they could look at whenever they wondered how she was doing.</p>
<p>As the owner of the account ‘Old Iron Art’, Hu Yiwei profusely apologized to Yu Yaoyao when the shooting was completed.</p>
<p>“Teacher Yu, I’m sorry. I apologize for looking down on you earlier, and for my utter disappointment when you were not who I wanted. I was too proud, thinking that you were still at the same level as you were five years ago. I was disrespectful to you in so many ways. I even spoke badly of you. I am very sorry,” he said as he bowed solemnly towards Yu Yaoyao. His guilt even drove him to delete his Weibo account.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was holding Little Bun’s hand in one hand, and Shen Yichong’s with the other. She raised their interlocked hands at him as she spoke. “Old Iron, what you did wasn’t nice. But as I am confident in myself and know that I am a beautiful, strong woman, I will not hold it against you, or let it upset me. If you had criticized a younger girl in that why, she might have been very hurt by your comment. If would have affected her mood for the shooting. If that had happened, how would you have been able to shoot the aura you wanted for the photo?”</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei kept on nodding, “Yes, you are right. I was unprofessional. I will reflect on it!”</p>
<p>“You are a professional. It is your job to guide newcomers when they are lost. If everyone could have perfect, beautiful pictures taken just by standing casually like I did, the professional photographers such as yourself would be unemployed,” the more Yu Yaoyao spoke, the prouder she felt.</p>
<p>“Yes. The shots of Mommy were beautiful…” Shen Rui agreed with his mother. He couldn’t help but narrow his eyes a little when he smiled.</p>
<p>Hu Yiwei opened his mouth slightly, but no words came out.</p>
<p>“Okay, I forgive you. Be kind to the other beauties in the future. Goodbye,” Yu Yaoyao said happily after she had heard her son’s praise.</p>
