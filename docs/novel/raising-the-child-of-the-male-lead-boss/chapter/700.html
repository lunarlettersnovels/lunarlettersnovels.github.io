            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 51 – An Unexpected Kiss</strong></p>
<p>Usually after dinner, the steamed bun would take a late-night bath before changing into his sleeping attire and play with his toys inside his bedroom. But today, he simply refused to take a bath and stubbornly remained inside the living room.</p>
<p>Every few minutes or so, he would rush towards the kitchen, the tail of his snake plushie trailing after him, where mama Xu was and ask her if his little dragon pajamas are dry.</p>
<p>Every time he got a negative answer from mama Xu, he would hold the white plushie snake, stand in place for a while, and then lethargically trod back to the living room, pretending not to see his father</p>
<p>And the more Shen Yichong looked at him with his probing gaze, the steamed stuffed bun would immediately hide behind Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Holding the snake plushie in his arms, the steamed bun sat next to Yu Yaoyao on the table, who was studying the script for her new project with a bitter face.</p>
<p>He looked up towards his father, who was staring at him with a pressuring gaze to get into the shower, with an expression of protest and said, “I’m going to wear new pajamas today, dad.”</p>
<p>“So, I can’t be bath early today, uhm. I won’t take a bath with you.” The steamed bun said cautiously, his little face flushing a little.</p>
<p>He looked carefully to the side at Yu Yaoyao’s expression. Upon seeing there was no unusual reaction, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>That’s right! He’s a good, sensible boy—a little adult now!</p>
<p>He wasn’t a senseless kid anymore who needed his dad just to take a shower!</p>
<p>Thinking this, the steamed bun calmly waved his hand at Shen Yichong in a shooing motion. “Dad, go first and take a bath yourself. Don’t wait for me.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong furrowed his eyebrows.</p>
<p>Does he look like a fool who only takes a bath when his son wants to accompany him?</p>
<p>“Okay, Shen Rui. Later, be careful not to get soap into your eyes, and after using your facial cleanser, wash your face properly and wipe it with a clean towel.” He turned and lastly added, “All on your own.”</p>
<p>“Dad!” As soon as his dad finished his lecture, Shen Rui the steamed bun flushed a deep scarlet and his pair of round black eyes glared at him.</p>
<p>With his small mouth quivering, he shouted, “I know that!”</p>
<p>After his small outburst, he secretly glanced at Yu Yaoyao for fear that she would find out that he would not take a bath on his own.</p>
<p>His mommy had said children need to learn how to be independent. If she found out that he was still depending on his dad, perhaps his mother would alienate him like before once more.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, his little fingers nervously picked the corner of his clothes.</p>
<p>He doesn’t want his mother to ignore him anymore, to refuse talking to him and especially to not hug him.</p>
<p>He looked at the big, white snake plushie in his arms and could not help but tighten his embrace around it.</p>
<p>This is the first time his mother has bought him a present.</p>
<p><em>And baby pajamas, too!</em></p>
<p>He wants to be an independent child so that his mother would continue pampering him with her affection. Just how it is now!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong seems to have read his son’s mind and did speak of anything else against him. He finally said, “Then I’ll go first. You be cautious of the time yourself, you still have to go to class tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun nodded at once, his expression brightening.</p>
<p>“Okay, dad! You can go ahead. Since I’ve grown up, I don’t need to take a bath with dad anymore!”</p>
<p>When the steamed bun thought of this, he pursed his mouth and nodded, convinced with this declaration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yu Yaoyao’s attention was heavily focused on the paper she was reading where the rules of the competition for ‘<em>Rebirth in the Limelight</em>’ was given.</p>
<p>In this new life, reading large paragraphs of text still posed quite a challenge to her, so she is particularly focused on reading, trying to digest the words slowly. Only after reading the last line did she hear the solemn declaration of the steamed bun to her side on the topic of bathing.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao could not help but laugh when she remembered the time where she had been showered by the zookeeper with a water hose.</p>
<p>Now the steamed bun had the same tragic expression on his little face, just like hers at that time.</p>
<p>“Why don’t the baby bath with mommy today?” She bowed her head and kissed the steamed bun on his pink cheeks.</p>
<p>A child’s skin is truly tender, smoother and even more supple than delicious pudding. Therefore, shen she kissed him on the cheeks, she truly found it enjoyable, and gave three more loud smacks in a row.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the steamed bun, who was talking about being independent, froze all over. After a while, his little body trembled.</p>
