            <p><strong>Chapter 259 – Reversal (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Yu Xinjie pressed the phone tightly to her ear. She couldn’t believe it. <em>Love?</em> She grabbed the tissue unconsciously and heard her mum reminding her dad to take his supplements.</p>
<p>It was all a farce. Her parents had never been in love. Her mum had served this man for years so that she could have her share of the Yu family’s property. She scrolled through her phone absent-mindedly. “Brother Chen Jiao, thank you for clearing that up. Maybe it is what it is.”</p>
<p>“I got to go now,” said Chen Jiao, “Don’t go against your sister alright? Fame and popularity can swallow a person up.”</p>
<p>The call ended. Yu Xinjie thought that to be true. Popularity could indeed swallow people whole. The higher one rose, the steeper the fall. She checked Weibo. A number of unfamiliar accounts were popping up with comments different from the praises showered on the couple:</p>
<p><strong>【 Shen Yichong couple is faking in the variety show! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 It’s proven! The stock price of Guangxin decreased, but the boss is still playing ‘being kidnapped’, not working, not dealing with it, and not looking anxious. Explanations?! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 Is it true love? Or just taking advantage? Shen Yichong takes the opportunity to advertise his wife’s image, trying to escape the company crisis! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 Everything is fictitious! Guangxin’s stock price rose by 8% in just one day. Is it the nourishment of love? Or using fans to rebound?! 】</strong></p>
<p><strong>【 Now we know the true reason for Chen Jiao leaving Guangxin! The boss only knows the hype, making his wife be on the hot search. Was he living off his wife?  】</strong></p>
<p>These contradictory voices did the job. The fans and other viewers who had been enjoying the show grew suspicious. Shen Yichong, in the Director’s car, checked the comments on the phone of the staff. His mouth twitched. Director Zhao was annoyed at the couple and their antics, so he felt a guilty pleasure. “What happened, Mr. Shen?” he provoked Shen Yichong, “Problems coming up? But you are smart, you and your wife can handle it with no problem.” He wasn’t really against the couple, though. He had always had a good relationship with Shen Yichong and would stand by them in their need. But his sarcasm was lost on Shen Yichong at that moment.</p>
<p>“Just one more minute,” said Shen Yichong, tapping his watch on his wrist.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Director Zhao, confused.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong didn’t offer any explanation. He handed the phone back to Director Zhao. “You will see very soon,” said he, “By the way, we aren’t allowed to use phones right? What if I gave Yu Yaoyao a call?”</p>
<p>Dirrector Zhao rolled his eyes. “Well, for that to happen,” he said, “she needs to have a phone too, which she doesn’t.”</p>
<p>He took the phone and glanced at the screen. It was five o’clock in the evening. Almost instantly, the latest major news popped up in a blaring headline. Zhao Yu’s mouth gaped open. He clicked on the news:</p>
<p><strong>【 Guangxin Entertainment, at 5 p.m. on December 30th, officially announced the acquisition of Digital Empire Film and Television Special Effects Company for a price of 30 million US dollars.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Digital Empire, is currently one of the largest and internationally recognized special effects production companies in China. It has produced more than a thousand outstanding works in many fields, such as movies, TV series, advertisements, games, and music.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the past three years, it has also provided cutting edge visual effects for more than 10 well-known movies, including those that have received the ‘Best Visual Effects’ award certification… 】</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled at the camera. “Sorry to disappoint you all. Me and my wife, we are both independent people with our own jobs. We do help each other out, but none of us lives off of the other.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu sighed. “Mr. Shen, if you had let me know earlier,” he said, “I would have bought the stock of Guangxin! Are you aiming to make your company the No. 1 entertainment company in the country? What’s next? Entering the movie market? Very ambitious.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong turned and pointed at his phone with a smile. “That’s the plan.”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu twitched his mouth, “So, you made it seem that you owed hundreds of millions in debt?”</p>
<p>“It was only necessary financing behavior in the capital market.” Shen Yichong smiled.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu was stunned. <em>This couple! They are not normal people! Guangxin’s stock is going to rollercoaster tomorrow!</em></p>
<p>People had requested access to Shen Yichong to question him just a while back, but now everyone was silent. The tide had suddenly turned.</p>
