            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 18 – Listen To Me!</strong></p>
<p>His back was soon wrapped around by a pair of soft arms. He could smell a mild, sweet fragrance brush his nostrils, akin to some kind of sugary, juicy fruit. He noticed it was quite a different taste from the heavy perfumes she used to douse herself in.</p>
<p>But Shen Yichong hesitated for only half a second before he fully stepped out of the car, yanking the arms off him.</p>
<p>An angry voice sounded from behind him at once!</p>
<p>“You two men! Can’t you hear me out first?!” Yu Yaoyao roared angrily.</p>
<p><i>Is it too much of a chore to give her a chance to talk and explain herself? After all, in this mess, she’s innocent, too! </i></p>
<p><i>And to let the child live a life thinking his mother had always been so dirty, cheating behind his father’s back? To let him live of a childhood filled with conflict made by his own parents? </i></p>
<p><i>She can’t let that be!</i></p>
<p>“Shen Yichong! Do you remember when your son’s birthday is?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s body shook.</p>
<p>“He’s now turning five, from the time he was inside my stomach.” She continued. “Do you remember the day you knew you had a baby?”</p>
<p>Shen Rui’s red face suddenly lifted from his father’s shoulders to look at her. The black eyes were at a loss. Crystal tears swirled in his eyes and threatened to fall down, but when he heard her words, they failed to drip.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao determinedly said the next words, “I wrote this letter to Little Ruirui.”</p>
<p>The little bun almost forgot to breathe through his nose. Shen Yichong, on the other hand, seemed to suddenly understand her message. Frowning, he looked back at his wife who had decided to wrap herself with a Doraemon shawl today.</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember?” Yu Yaoyao smiled at him with tearful eyes. “On that day, I hadn’t been feeling well before I even made it to the filming site. So I went to the hospital to get examined, and only then did I know that I had a baby. That baby is Little Ruirui, who is turning five soon.”</p>
<p>“You told me not to appear on set that day because you were afraid the baby would get hurt, but I had already promised the director and my manager. I couldn’t go back on my word,” Yu Yaoyao said, showing a forlorn smile at Shen Yichong.</p>
<p><i>I can only help you hide your wrongdoings until here. </i>She inwardly thought, sending a silent message to the original owner.</p>
<p>“However, I was actually worried about the baby, and I felt guilty about it afterward. Therefore… I wrote this love letter for my baby and I prayed that the baby would grow strong and healthy.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s nose slowly turned red and in a dismayed voice, she said, “But I didn’t expect people would be so vicious. That even a letter written a long time ago would be unearthed and used against me; using it in gossip to slander my name and for people to come and insult me.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao thought of the time she had been accused wrongly at the zoo. Obviously, she hadn’t been the one leaving the stools everywhere and she was absolutely not the culprit responsible for stealing the bird from the neighboring garden. But the zookeeper had insisted that she did it and he scolded her for three days, starving her for two meals!</p>
<p>When she remembered how aggrieved she was, she couldn’t hold back the pain! Tears immediately rolled down, and as if the flood gates of heaven had been opened, they wouldn’t stop.</p>
<p>If she had been able to speak and defend herself, then she wouldn’t feel this miserable. Now that she had died, that keeper would only think of her as a bad snake for the rest of his life!</p>
<p>Her tears were like gushing pearls in broken lines. “I’m telling you. It’s my baby that I love the most, but no one believes it! Wooo!”</p>
<p>The little bun immediately panicked. “Don’t cry. Mommy, don’t cry! Ruirui is wrong! I misunderstood Mommy!”</p>
<p>“Mommy…” He held out his little hand wanting to wipe the tears from Yu Yaoyao’s face, but because he was in his father’s embrace, his chubby hands only touched air. He struggled to get back to his seat, quickly forgetting his earlier haven on his father’s chest.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong only had a complicated look on his face. Yu Yaoyao immediately sobbed loudly and moved her fingers towards the screen of her cellphone. She zoomed in the picture of the love letter and showed it to the little bun.</p>
<p>“Come and see for yourself. Am I talking nonsense?”</p>
