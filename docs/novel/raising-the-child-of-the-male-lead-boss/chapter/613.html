            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 139 – Acting Debut as Family (2)</strong></p>
<p>Just then Yu Yaoyao came back with Ni Yi. They drove to the Lay’s company to sign a new advertising contract and came back later than the director. As soon as she entered, Shen Rui, the little bun, who was still sitting beside his father, stood up instantly.</p>
<p>“Mommy~”</p>
<p>He rushed at her like a bullet and plunged headlong into her soft arms. His father was unable to utter his concerns in time, as he saw the little bun already at his mother’s embrace.</p>
<p>“Aiya! My lovely baby~” Yu Yaoyao lifted the little fellow high and held him in her arms.</p>
<p>The little bun stuffed his head into her neck, breathing in the comforting scent of his mother.</p>
<p>“Mommy, the uncles are looking for you so you can work at home.”</p>
<p>Only then did Yu Yaoyao see the two guests sitting in front of Shen Yichong. “Director?” she asked with surprise.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu immediately relayed their agreement again. As soon as he was done, Yu Yaoyao’s eyes had lit up. Far <em>too </em>much for Shen Yichong’s liking.</p>
<p>“Film at home?”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu nodded eagerly, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“I just lay down and eat snacks, play games and watch my favorite dramas…? And I’m still going to be paid?” Her mouth twitched. Her soul felt as if it had gone to heaven together with her equally enthusiastic child.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu felt suffocated for a moment but later hid it with a cough. “You will also have to interact with your family…”</p>
<p>Two beautiful eyes stared at him in disbelief. <em>God, what kind of heavenly show is this!?</em> She’s best at being a homebody! It naturally stemmed from her experience back in the zoo, where she was inside her closure every day. Yu Yaoyao looked pointedly at Ni Yi, who was also unable to restrain the emotion from his face.</p>
<p>She became cheerier in an instant.</p>
<p>Little Yi’s encouraging expression told her this program would give her a boost in popularity! Nevertheless, her acting roles separate her from the <em>real </em>her—this time, the public would have a better grasp on who she was beyond the camera. And it’s naturally different when at home. Her beauty was like a chameleon, changing every minute of the day!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong watched her flail in high spirits and wordlessly passed her the program contract.</p>
<p>She was given another surprise! “Four cameramen will follow me every day? And there are also cameras in every room… we can also film outside…”</p>
<p>While her eyes were ablaze with excitement, Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched in premonition.</p>
<p>The director and the producer were taken aback at the moment, but the director ultimately understood a little about Yu Yaoyao’s love for acting. In the heat of the moment, he threw out another favorable condition to tempt her in.</p>
<p>“In this show, you won’t be following a script. You have complete freedom to just be as you are in private.”</p>
<p>Her heart soared against her chest.</p>
<p><em>Yes.</em> She doesn’t need to play anyone else—her raw self was more than enough!</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong saw her fired up, he stretched out a hand to massage his throbbing temple. He couldn’t help but wonder, <em>Has she gone stupid or she’s just become naive…</em></p>
<p>What the director said about<em> being as you are in private</em> was definitely far from just laying down to binge on some snacks.</p>
<p>“Can you both give us some time to think about it first.” He couldn’t let Yu Yaoyao become more swayed in the matter.</p>
<p>“If we are to participate in this reality show, Guangxin entertainment will have to propose amendments to some specific terms and contents in the program,” he stated, leaving no room for objection.</p>
<p>The chief executive producer immediately smiled wryly, “Of course, that would be no problem at all. Well then, boss Shen,” he turns to the giddy woman beside him, “Madam Shen, it’s getting late. And little fellow, your uncles will go now, goodbye, and thank you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao waved happily after their departing figures. As soon as they were out of sight, she carefully read the contract details for <em>My Wife and I</em>.</p>
<p>“Oh. My. God. <strong>Ten</strong> million?!” she exclaimed in astonishment.</p>
<p>The cogs of her brain instantly began moving—how many snacks would she be able to buy with this amount of money? She hasn’t even used her income from the previous TV show.</p>
<p>“Little Yiyi, we have advanced!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s eyebrows jumped to his hairline. “Elder sister, this is a reality show for couples. So… for the income, we’ll have to discuss it later…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi cast a glance at the silent Shen Yichong. Indeed, this was a rare man with a poignant status—<em>this cannot be! The price must be higher!</em> Ten million is a slap in the face, they should receive at least thrice the amount just for including the elusive boss Shen in it.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao listened and nodded, feeling more admiration for Shen Yichong. “Husband, rea;lly are <em>fierce</em>.”</p>
<p>She was given only three million dollars for the pudding advertisement—and that was already a one-year endorsement fee.</p>
<p>“Mommy, is this job for you and daddy?” The little bun pouted immediately upon being excluded from the narrative. He had just taken a bath when he heard only a word from his uncles, but not the rest of what the adults have conversed about.</p>
<p>He ran to the side of the sofa, where he hid his small tablet. He opened up the trailer for the next show and held it up to his mother, “Will you and dad appear here together?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao glanced at the little bun and nodded with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>“Yes.” She squatted down to pat the dejected boy in the head, “This time, my baby will also be able to see your dad on the screen!”</p>
<p>But her excited words were only met with a dull gaze from the little bun.</p>
<p>“All right,” Shen Yichong hurriedly placed a stop to the conversation and told Yu Yaoyao, “Take a shower now. Go to bed early.” He deftly took the contract from her hands.</p>
<p>“I’ll have the marketing department analyze the program’s value before making a decision.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao bared her teeth at him. <em>Going through such trouble?</em></p>
<p>“Well, tell them to make it quick. I can’t let the audience miss the sight of my face for even just a day.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled dryly while Ni Yi was left speechless.</p>
<p>As soon as Yu Yaoyao entered the bathroom, Shen Rui took the small tablet into his embrace, his cheeks bulging further with his frown. As if on the tip of bursting, he finally walked to Shen Yichong with a miserable face.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Shen Yichong narrowed his eyes at his son and the stubborn hair that stood on its end on his head.</p>
<p>The little bun pouted and complained his grievances, “Dad is bad.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “?”</p>
<p>The little bun stepped forward and raised his head, a determined look on his face. “I want to be on TV too. I want to be with my mommy!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong felt as if he would faint the next moment.</p>
