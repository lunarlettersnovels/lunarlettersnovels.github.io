            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 132 – Don’t Make Your Husband Jealous (1)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s narcissism made Ni Yi speechless. Seeing him stunned, the former decided to get to the point,</p>
<p>“All right, bad news first.”</p>
<p>Shaken from his initial shock, Ni Yi lamented, “Oh, the bad news is… I’m afraid you will have to work hard and lose weight for a long time!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was stunned. She stared at him the moment she heard this and covered her stomach defensively with one hand.</p>
<p>“No! I didn’t steal any potato chips and pudding or eat another steak last night! I haven’t even touched the steamed buns, and the Duck blood and vermicelli soup prepared this morning…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi almost felt himself go bald, and his face was that of helplessness.</p>
<p>“Elder sister… you were a food thief again…” he said helplessly.</p>
<p>“I didn’t, I…” Then after some pause, she looked at her manager curiously, “How did you know?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi felt that he had indeed lost a patch of hair on his head!</p>
<p>“All right, let’s get to the point.” He shook his head, “You need to lose weight because the good news is… your favorite pudding brand wants you to be their ambassador after watching the video released the other day.”</p>
<p>He said and took out a document from his bag. “This is the endorsement contract sent by the other party. I allowed our lawyers to look over it. The contract amounts to… 3 million. We need to have you film an advertisement for the pudding immediately.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao became thrilled when she heard the news. Most importantly, the price of her contracts has risen!</p>
<p>Ni Yi turned to where the script for the advertisement was and held it to her to see.</p>
<p>“The advertisement needs you tasting pudding of different flavors. The 3 million endorsement also gives you privileges to enjoy other beverages and snacks under their company.”</p>
<p>“I have estimated it would need a total of three to five advertisements to be shoot, and this, of course, posters to be put out… Furthermore, the other party requests that you publish at least 50 tweets in a year so you can eat their products in private at home. Short videos and GIFs must compromise more than 50 percent of the posts!” Ni Yi spoke at a fast pace.</p>
<p>As he saw Yu Yaoyao’s eyes getting brighter with every uttered word, his heart suddenly cooled in tandem.</p>
<p>“Elder sister… please don’t forget to control your weight. If you overeat… you won’t look good on the camera, and this might affect your image in posters…”</p>
<p>“I know, I know,” Yaoyao hurriedly dismissed. “But isn’t this like sports?” She mumbled enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao waved her hand. She had torn small flowers—that too was some kind of sport. There was also a lot of exercises involved every time she flirted with her husband.</p>
<p>While speaking, she suddenly took a sip of water to parch her dry throat. The different flavored puddings continually occupied her mind.</p>
<p>It seemed as if she was in a perpetual, giddy mood. “Oh, you told me that filiming is urgent. When do I start?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi coughed, “You have an appointment tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I still have to wait a day…” Yaoyao said.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Ni Yi touched his head and immediately turned it to the side. He stopped looking eager face, which was giving him agony and continued, “Zhou Dao asked you to go to his place next week for a makeup shoot. He called off your audition, and he says you can directly act in his new drama as the beauty capable of toppling countries…”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s lips were stretched taut. “That suits me fine!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi sighed and was about to speak when Shen Yichong pushed open the door with an audible sound. He entered the room with his usual poker face looking a little dark. Ni Yi immediately swallowed his words and pretended to be a tree.</p>
<p>Over the past few days where Yu Yaoyao was recuperating from her illness, his boss’s air-conditioner aura has decreased quite a bit. He could talk to the latter without feeling a blizzard now… Moreover, after the whistleblower fan defended Yaoyao by posting ‘<em>My wife has been recently good,’</em> the boss was obviously in a decent mood. The frequency of his death glares had significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Ni Yi had thought before that the boss would be resentful of the anonymous fan’s ID, but surprisingly, his boss wasn’t a bit mad. Now, Ni Yi was quite curious of the reason why the boss’s expression was dark.</p>
<p>“What is this?” Shen Yichong was quick to get to the point. He took out his mobile phone, his voice showing his agitation.</p>
<p>Ni Yi took a quick peek and saw a recently released photo under her elder sister’s official ID.</p>
<p><strong>[Yu Yaoyao: For those who think I am lying, see this for yourself!</strong> <strong>I don’t need anyone’s evidence, because I am the iron tool that destroys all evil forces!]</strong></p>
<p>Attached below the fiery statement were two photos. One was the hotel scandal photo of the unknown woman’s full-body, while the other is a selfie she just took while standing in front of a mirror while he was talking to Ni Yi! In this mirror selfie, she also pulled up her loose-fitting nightgown to her waist, revealing her slim curves and… the pair of long legs underneath!</p>
<p>There was also some text edited into the photo. In the first picture, there was a big fork drawn on the leg of the hotel woman. Meanwhile, the second one, the measurement on her long legs, was specially marked 1.1 meters!</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s mouth almost dropped to the floor! He rapidly took out his mobile phone, and soon as he caught sight of it, it had disappeared into the crowd of many posts, only to rise from the darkness and top as a hot search!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s microblog post was instantly seen by several big V’s and frantically shared. Comments soon piled up like hundreds of floors!</p>
<p><strong>[This is my queen, YY! OMG! Her way of clarifying things is always so fresh and refined!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Uncontrollable nosebleeds, OMG!</strong> <strong>Please forgive me, these legs… are really long!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[When will my sister hold a fan meeting?! I want to lick my sister’s face and long legs on the spot!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[That Meng black flower could have never thought a pair of legs would defeat her!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Hurry, screenshots! Make it your screensaver!]</strong></p>
<p>“Delete it immediately.” Shen Yichong spoke in a clipped tone.</p>
