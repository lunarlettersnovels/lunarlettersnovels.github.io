<p><strong>Chapter 350</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>“Darling, are you jealous?” Yu Yaoyao blinked, and she reached out to raise his chin. “It’s okay, those little elves are just passersby. There is only space for you in my heart.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong used his other hand and pressed her onto the bed. He grabbed the script and tossed it over his shoulder. For a little while he had felt relaxed about her shooting alone with the crew. But after this… He felt that he should perhaps visit her more often during this drama.</p>
<p>“The little elves? I think you are the queen of the elves!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao reached over and grabbed his bottom, “Ooh… How did you know…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong gave her a charming smile.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Ling Shuang waited for many days, controlling her temper, and making plans for herself to read and study the script every day.</p>
<p>Until finally, it was the start-up ceremony for the crew of ‘In the Mountain’.</p>
<p>When the clock hit 4 o’clock in the morning, Ling Shuang’s alarm woke her up. She couldn’t wait to change into the high-class dress that Chen Jiao had bought for her a few days ago. She put on delicate makeup and got her manager to take her to a saloon to do her hair.</p>
<p>After getting into the nanny car, she took out her phone and texted:</p>
<p><em>[Brother Chen, I’m on my way.]</em></p>
<p>Ling Shuang sent the text message to Chen Jiao to report on her schedule. And then she became impatient</p>
<p>Chen Jiao had been busy with filming lately. He no longer called her for an hour each day, nor did he share with her things that had happened throughout his day.</p>
<p>She was not used to it and felt unusually free and refreshed. Finally, she didn’t need to pretend. She had to be so careful every day, afraid of revealing something… After pretending for so many years, she almost forgotten her original character!</p>
<p>Ling Shuang gripped her phone tightly.</p>
<p>Originally, she was a little worried that the discouraged Yu Xinjie would confess to all the things they had done.</p>
<p>But she had been receiving motivational text messages from Chen Jiao every day for the past few days. He had even got his manager to send her some expensive clothes, heels, and jewelry. All these had made her feel at ease.</p>
<p><em>[34 more days. Hang in there.]</em></p>
<p><em>[30 more days. Hang in there.]</em></p>
<p><em>[25 more days. Hang in there.]</em></p>
<p><em>[1 day left.]</em></p>
<p>Irritation flashed in Ling Shuang’s eyes when she looked at the recent chat history. She might still have felt warm inside if the messages were really for her. But she knew that his care and love was for another girl. This rightfully made her annoyed. Soon. Soon, she would replace Yu Yaoyao and marry Shen Yichong. By then, she wouldn’t need to bother with this irritating and insincere harassment every day!</p>
<p>Ling Shuang closed her eyes and reached out to touch the expensive diamond necklace around her neck. Then, a smile slowly appeared on her face. Chen Jiao still had his uses, even though he was annoying.</p>
<p>“Xiao Huang, wake me up when we are almost there. I am going to take a nap,” she said.</p>
<p>During the two- or three-hours’ drive, she had a sweet dream. She dreamed that the crew director praised her for her savvy performance. She was praised for her thorough study of the script, her beautiful appearance, and her hardworking spirit. She even attracted a huge investment and admiration of Shen Yichong, the owner of Guangxin.</p>
<p>But the squeaking of the car’s brakes woke her.</p>
<p>She had been walking in bright red high heels, holding a limited-edition handbag, showing her long legs that could put Yu Yaoyao’s to shame… She was just walking to the start-up venue of the crew…</p>
<p>And her dream abruptly ended.</p>
<p>At the shooting location, the opening ceremony had already begun. The whole crew was taking a group photo in front of the incense burner and the reporters were taking pictures like crazy at the grand ceremony.</p>
<p>“Xiao Huang, what time is it now? Are we late?” Ling Shuang exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Sister Shuang…” the assistant said helplessly.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang immediately dug for her phone in her handbag to call Chen Jiao. Her beautiful eyes anxiously searched through the crowds for the director of the crew as she thought about how to explain why she was so late. But before she could find her phone or come up with an explanation, the reporters spotted her.</p>
<p>They immediately started rushing over.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang’s face went pale, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry… I’m late. I got stuck in traffic on the highway…”</p>
<p>The reporters were shocked when they heard what she said. But that didn’t deter them at all:</p>
<p>“Are you Miss Ling Shuang? Are you aware that you have been replaced in your role?”</p>
<p>“The director just announced that Gu Qianqian will play the role of ‘daughter’. What is your opinion?”</p>
<p>“Miss Ling, you seemed very prepared for today. Are you here to participate in the opening ceremony?”</p>
<p>“What!” She couldn’t believe this; she was being replaced!</p>
<p>Ling Shuang panicked. She scratched through her handbag and finally found her phone. With shaking hands, she dialed Chen Jiao’s number.</p>
<p>But her calls never connected. Perhaps he was busy filming…</p>
<p>More and more reporters stuck their microphones in her face.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang was forced to step back. Feeling panicked and ashamed, she couldn’t help but grab her manager’s hand. But she was also angry and so pinched the manager’s skin between her nails. “Xiao Huang, what… what is the meaning of this?” she demanded.</p>
<p>When the manager felt the pain in her arm, she unconsciously flicked Ling Shaung away with a little more force than was necessary.</p>
<p>Ling Shuang couldn’t catch her balance on her ten-inch heels fast enough. She screamed as her heels got caught between the paving and she fell. All she could hear before she hit the ground was the clicking of the camera shutters. It was as thought they couldn’t wait to humiliate her even further.</p>
