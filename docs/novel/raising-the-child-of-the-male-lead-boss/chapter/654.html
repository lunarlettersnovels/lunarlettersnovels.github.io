            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 97 – Diamond Man</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao got off the stage and looked at Meng Xinran with an ambiguous smile.</p>
<p>“Thank you, sister Ran; thank you for <em>leaving</em> this topic to me.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran fuming to the point she was almost about to vomit blood, but she could only swallow her bitter defeat and squeeze a forced smile in front of the camera. “I truly admire my sister’s ability to implement some realness into acting performances,” she said between gritted teeth.</p>
<p>A hint of shyness appeared on Yu Yaoyao’s beautiful face. “I wasn’t acting—that was my true color all along. Oh, excuse me; please allow me to make a phone call.”</p>
<p>For today, Ni Yi was not able to accompany her as he went to the Lay’s company for a follow-up on their advertising contract. She dialed his number, smile still on place; she even went as far as to pat her chest with a triumphant expression in front of Meng Xinran.</p>
<p>“Little Yi, I finished today’s task and won the first place. And one of the panel judges said that he wanted me to act in his play. I left your phone number to him. What? Oh, of course. I am the best, I knew it from the very beginning…”</p>
<p>And in front of her, Meng Xinran’s hand was convulsing in anger as she listened to Yu Yaoyao’s words.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>All contestants were soon able to perform, with the twenty contestants on the bottom eliminated according to their number of votes. Moreover, Meng Xinran had the lowest number of votes, but Chen Jiao had used his gold medal to save her from this round to enter the next one. But other contestants were not as fortunate and had to leave the program.</p>
<p>Just as everyone thought it was over, a newly released hot search that shot up to 10th place became the buzz during the afternoon shooting,</p>
<p><em>#Yu Yaoyao’s Past Hotel Dating Cheating Photos</em></p>
<p>Attached in it were photos two people in a hotel room at night shared by several big and verified media outlets. It was a hotel with floor to ceiling windows were the figures of a man and a woman together was clearly captured. The three pictures contained them fiercely hugging, kissing and smiling as they chatted.</p>
<p>Most noticeable was that the woman’s side profile looked vaguely similar to Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>As soon as this hot search topic came out, it was bombarded with thousands of comments and tens of thousands of shares following her massive popularity on the program. As expected, she was soon bombarded with expletives from netizens.</p>
<p><strong>[Isn’t this the Lays goddess? She’s actually a dirty girl.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Holy! Then that official explanation for the alleged love letter is nothing but bull! This is infidelity!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[This madam is too unrestrained!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Pah! To think I even liked this beautiful sister before. And now her poor lying skills have been exposed—she’s done for!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[What the h**l? Wasn’t this the same woman who was rumored to like Chen Jiao from a while ago? This woman has too many men! I’m afraid Mr. Shen is wearing a green hat<sup class="modern-footnotes-footnote " data-mfn="1"><a data-mfn-reset="">1</a></sup>!]<br>
</strong></p>
<p>After this hot search, all the staff and contestants of the ‘In the Limelight’ program naturally changed their perception of Yu Yaoyao. Before, they were very friendly to her because of her background and her good acting skills garnered their respect. But at the moment, there was obviously more contempt and doubt in their eyes that the previous warm feelings.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao knew nothing about the catastrophe happening around her. As soon as she had heard it was break time, she had quickly asked the assistant director for her mobile phone. She was at the corner almost about to shed tears while watching a Korean drama.</p>
<p>It was Meng Xinran who came forth to interrupt her break with a sweet smile, “Sister, something big has happened.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her watery eyes. This sight made Meng Xinran’s earlier bitter heart soar.</p>
<p>She placed her mobile phone in front of Yu Yaoyao and directly showed her the photos.</p>
<p>“Sister, this time… it’s not so good.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao rubbed her eyes, raised the canteen on her and looked at her cell phone.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry; don’t cry, sister.” Meng Xinran chuckled and smiled, “Who is this man? Do you want me to post a blog to clarify it?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao paused and took a sip of water. But soon she reached out a finger and swiped the screen over. As a result, she let out a loud cry.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran felt beyond ecstatic. <em>Why are you surprised? Be afraid!</em></p>
<p>But soon she heard a charming laugh come from Yu Yaoyao and the statement: “My diamond man is too kind…”</p>
