            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 117 – Overbearing CEO Husband</strong></p>
<p>Long legs stepped on the ground. Shen Yichong’s face was icy and stoic, as his gaze probed unto Meng Xinran as if he were watching a dead object.</p>
<p>“For incomplete projects, all compensation shall be borne by your royalties. If it’s not enough, you will pay them back after serving your time in jail.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran, who was initially pleading with tears, absently looked at him in daze and horror.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was escorted by Ni Yi’s hand as she went out of the car. But she didn’t need any help after all, because she, herself, passed by Meng Xinran.</p>
<p>Tossing her hair, she smiled and opened her lips to say, “Dear, I have done my part and promised to spare you.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything.” Meng Xinran lifted her bitter face towards Yu Yaoyao, the hate palpable in her eyes, “You are just relying—”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao interrupted with a loud snort, “Yes, yes! I only depend on my husband. Just bite me already.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s glare never wavered.</p>
<p>“Come on; I’ll do it with you. Even if I lose!”</p>
<p>With a dark face, Shen Yichong stretched out a hand and firmly pulled Yu Yaoyao to his side.</p>
<p>“Let’s go in.”</p>
<p>“Okay, husband. If you say so.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Leaving Meng Xinran behind, who was lying on the ground, they made their way towards the venue rented by the program’s group for today. Yu Yaoyao’s entrance then became the highlight of the audience’s focus.</p>
<p>Dressed in pink tweed Chanel skirt and top, and covered with a faux wool coat in the same color that reached her knees, her straight and fair legs were exposed, seizing attention.</p>
<p>Such a pale skin tone sometimes looked ghastly, but her skin glowed bright like pearls. She had the aura of a supermodel, especially when she sashayed her hips as she walked.</p>
<p>The noise in the venue immediately lowered by a notch. Photographers became dazed for a moment before they were suddenly woken from their stupor, giving Yu Yaoyao cheers and claps.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was wearing his black aviators, frowned.</p>
<p>Noting everyone’s sight on Yu Yaoyao, especially the aggressive gazes of the men on the scene, he pressed his lips together tightly. His strong palm directly grabbed ahold of her waist.</p>
<p>“Don’t sway your hips.” Shen Yichong spits out four words with emphasis. His eyes like swords pierced through the sunglasses, scanning Yu Yaoyao’s body.</p>
<p>Soon, another frown appeared on his face. “Next time, don’t wear such a short skirt. I’ll have your stylist rebuild your wardrobe.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao paused, “Huh?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his chin. “Don’t you remember what you just told Meng Xinran?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…?”</p>
<p>“You depend on your husband. That means you have to listen to me.”</p>
<p>“…” Yu Yaoyao was rendered speechless by Shen Yichong for the first time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Shen Yichong was reasonable. Seeing her astonished face, he decided to relax the conditions a little. “I’ll let you wear it if you stop walking like that.”</p>
<p>But this only made Yu Yaoyao’s face more bitter.</p>
<p><em>What’s wrong with the way I walk?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>After greeting the director’s group, Shen Yichong then learned of today’s topics for the competition.</p>
<p>“For this stage, we will have an underwater performance. There are several groups of topics to choose from, all to be performed underwater.”</p>
<p>The director was also present in the venue today. Due to the big event that occurred yesterday evening, his spirits were secretly in full swing. He glanced at Yu Yaoyao who was looking over the list handed by the staff.</p>
<p><em>Falling into the water after a disagreement</em></p>
<p><em>Falling into the water after a fight</em></p>
<p><em>Suicide in the lake</em></p>
<p><em>Slipping…</em></p>
<p>Most, if not all, topics were unsettling to look at, even if there were numerous topics one could choose. Yet Yu Yaoyao looked at the artificial lake surrounded by cameras, her eyes gleaming.</p>
<p>“Is that the lake we are going to act in?”</p>
<p>The pool in front of her looked much cleaner than the water back in her snake house. To think at the beginning, if it were not by the law enforcement of the demon world, she would have been a big boss of a large lake of the wilds!</p>
<p>But then, Shen Yichong’s mild icy voice rang.</p>
<p>“It’s a few degrees low today. Is it necessary for the program’s team to do this?”</p>
<p>In their haste to attract the audience’s attention, they hardly even considered the competitor’s safety and well-being. If one were to submerge themselves in the water at such temperature, it would be akin to courting hypothermia.</p>
<p>“Boss Shen, many underwater scenes can only be filmed in this way; this is how they do it in movie productions as well.” The director pointed out embarrassedly.</p>
<p>“We prepared everything beforehand. We have all kinds of protection and measures to keep the artist’s warm. Ginger soup and cold granules can be given out any time, and a medical team is also at the site if anything happens.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s gaze bore into the sweating director, but his face was still unyielding.</p>
<p>The director sighed and looked at Yu Yaoyao. Feeling unfortunate, he said, “If madam Shen is still frightened from last night, she could rest for today. She can shoot next time.”</p>
