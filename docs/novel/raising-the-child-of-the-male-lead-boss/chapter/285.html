            <p><strong>Chapter 478</strong></p>
<p>Little Bun was not done yet. While Fang Qiuye was stunned, he took out a huge piece of paper and spread it out to occupy most of the table. There were one hundred grids on this paper.</p>
<p>“I have to check this for a hundred days,” He pointed. “Today is the first day.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, he took out a small seal and stamped a small red flower on the paper. “Once you check in for 14 consecutive days, you can exchange them with Ruirui brand body massage; 10 consecutive days, you can get Ruirui brand exclusive castle toys… 100 consecutive days, you can get ten cups of Ruirui brand fruit juice!”</p>
<p>After Little Bun finished speaking, he took out the tablet and showed them the actual photos of the gift. “Mommy, Aunty Big Head, good luck to you!”</p>
<p>His tone was very similar to the kindergarten teacher who bewitched kids to take a good nap and get a small red flower stamp in return!</p>
<p>“Okay! Let’s get started, Big Head!” Yu Yaoyao raised her sleeves. “Show the world that we’ll never admit defeat!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye, “…”</p>
<p>Who was she and where was she! Was she studying for real before?! If she had such a caring baby, she would probably never delay submitting her drafts!</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao took a breath and turned to the first page of the book seriously. Fang Qiuye looked over nervously. She breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the words in there. Fortunately, it was primary school level English. Yaoyao, who wasn’t testing the netizens, was very realistic with her English skills. She didn’t start with translations that she couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>The course she was looking at was introducing the differences of Western food. It was the English terms for tableware, names of some common food, and extremely simple grammar.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s original level, coupled with the grammar framework she learned from her blind for nearly ten days, was completely enough to teach Yaoyao! According to the content in the textbook, Fang Qiuye started with a conversational and relaxed routine. She started with simple vocabulary and taught her exactly like how her blind date taught her.</p>
<p>“Speaking of western food…” Soon, Shen Yichong brought the fruit platter over. “I will cook western food for you in the evening. You can memorize the names while eating. Rest now and eat some fruit.”</p>
<p>Mr. Shen was simply the type of parent who would spoil his children.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye glanced at the timer. In less than 50 minutes, they had rested twice. They went for a walk in the garden and listened to Little Bun’s little story telling. Now they were eating fruits?!</p>
<p>When they finally finished the lesson, Little Bun came over, “Mommy, are you taking a break to see my little sister?”</p>
<p>His expression looked like he wanted his mommy to have a break after a harsh day. Fang Qiuye originally wanted to teach two lessons in one breath, but the plan failed directly.</p>
<p>“My mommy can’t remember that much.”  When Yu Yaoyao was on the second floor to see Little Sweetheart, Little Bun secretly told Fang Qiuye. “Just teach her the usual amount a person can learn in one class. Otherwise Mommy will forget everything the next day, and she will be sad.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong also sat down on the sofa in the living room, and nodded apologetically to Fang Qiuye, “Sorry for troubling you to come over. Please eat more for dinner,” he said. “If there’s anything you like from the snack box, please bring some home.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye swallowed her saliva. Could it be that her craving for the snack box just now was discovered?</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao went to the second floor for fifteen minutes, she finally came back. Shen Yichong and Little Bun acted like nothing had happened. As Shen Yichong went to prepare meals, Little Bun went to the small garden to paint. Fang Qiuye felt that the father and son were simply angels who spoiled Yaoyao.</p>
<p>She wasn’t sure what Yaoyao did in her past life to live such a happy life.</p>
<p>“Eh? Big Head, do you read novels too?” Yu Yaoyao’s eyes flickered suddenly.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye almost bit her tongue. Did she accidentally think out loud just now?!</p>
<p>“Well, I also think what I got is not the script of a female supporting role, but a script for the female lead!” Yaoyao said. She had really heard what Fang Qiuye said!</p>
<p>“I didn’t save the world, but it might be the good karma accumulated for 200 years!” she continued, to Fan Qiuye’s confusion. “By the way, Big Head, do you have any good novels to recommend? I’ve been at home lately, and there’s a shortage of books!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was sad when she talked about this. She could read just any novel when she was in the zoo. But now, it seemed that her taste had improved. Many of the current novels couldn’t satisfy her anymore!</p>
<p>“We can exchange our book lists!” Thinking so, Yu Yaoyao happily took out her phone and clicked on her reading app.</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye shook. “Yao…”</p>
<p>The app she opened was exactly where she posted her novels! Yaoyao turned out to be one of the readers?!</p>
<p>“Well, I love reading novels very much! Big Head, I like reading sweet and funny novels. How about you?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was really excited. Her best friend Little Sisi and her husband were both people who didn’t read online novels. Except for the screenwriter she knew, she couldn’t find anyone to communicate the plot of the novel. But the screenwriter was very busy, her status was always <em>‘Do not disturb. Busy with the draft’</em>. She was too embarrassed to bother her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao finally found someone who had the same interest as her. She quickly showed her bookshelf in the app and shared it with Big Head.</p>
<p>“Big Head, I especially like this author’s books. She is very funny. <em>‘Shen Dacheng’</em>, do you know her?” she began. “I really liked her novel <em>‘I’m raising a boss in a wealthy family’</em>. It’s so funny, I could laugh till I’m rolling on the ground…”</p>
<p>The toothpick in Fang Qiuye’s mouth snapped off. Shen Dacheng, what a familiar name… isn’t it the name she used as an author! ?</p>
<p>“By the way, Big Head, let’s add each other on WeChat? I’ll share this book with you!” she continued. “The only bad thing was that the writer updates so slowly. It makes me want to send her a blade. Tsk!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye: “…!”</p>
