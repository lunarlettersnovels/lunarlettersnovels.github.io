            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 169 – A Formidable Contender (1)</strong></p>
<p>“So even if Mommy is far away, she can still see me.” Little Bun smiled happily, his cheeks turned red.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the venue, the sunglasses affected the sight of the little bun, he couldn’t see anything- it was all pitch black. Shen Yichong helped him take off his sunglasses and put on a mask instead. In conclusion, he must cover his son’s face to protect him from the public.  He knew that later the camera would most likely pan in their direction, especially when it’s Yu Yaoyao’s performance.</p>
<p>The father and son sat in the family area. Shen Yichong had this usual indifferent aura, distinct from the lively surroundings. He just stared at the stage coldly, his expression only softening when his son talked.</p>
<p>And for the first time in his life, Shen Rui finally went to the stage with so many people to watch his mother’s live performance which he only used to see on his tablet and TV. How he’d beg his father every day to take him to see his Mommy working, but because of the late dismissal of his school, his Mommy was already off her work by the time he reached the filming set.</p>
<p>So today, Little Bun had the opportunity to watch the staff preparing the stage, he was more excited than anyone else in the hall. Sitting on the couch, his little feet that did not reach the ground were gaily swinging in the air.</p>
<p>After a while, he took his little telescope from his bag and excitedly looked at the stage.</p>
<p>“Dad, when will Mommy come out?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong considered for a moment and replied. “It’ll depend on the lottery; your Mommy could be the last one to play.” Not long after, he helped his son adjust his necktie.</p>
<p>Now, Yu Yaoyao’s popularity had already surpassed the second place of the competition, Qiu Dajian, and she was even more popular than Meng Xinran after the incident that happened.</p>
<p>Based on the sequence of the show, Yu Yaoyao would perform at the very end.  In the end, the Little Bun grumbled in disappointment as he was so eager to see his Mommy’s performance.</p>
<p><em>That’ll be a long wait…</em></p>
<p>He immediately turned around and looked at the small satchel on the couch. He playfully turned the strap over, and went about so for a while. Shen Yichong quietly reached out to his son and patted his head. How’d he not know his son’s thoughts!</p>
<p>“They have everything backstage. If your mother needs something, she will contact us.”</p>
<p>As soon as his son turned around, Shen Yichong remembered that Little Bun was willing to become her personal cotton-padded jacket and yet she didn’t even know how to change her son’s diapers!</p>
<p>At those words, Shen Rui was relieved. “Dad, your cell phone must be on all the time ~”</p>
<p>Shen Rui didn’t have a cell phone. If his Mommy were in trouble, she could only call his Daddy.</p>
<p>He was not at ease, so he grabbed his father’s hand to check whether his cell phone was on or not. Shen Yichong, though found his son’s actions funny, was a little miffed because it was typically rude.</p>
<p>At nine thirty in the morning, the live broadcast of the variety program officially began. In the beginning, the hosts organized the contestants to draw lots. Many audiences who followed every episode of ‘In the Limelight’ from start to finish, as well as fans of each competitor, stayed in front of their computers for the first time. Most of them were eager to comment on every scene of the live broadcasting.</p>
<p><strong>[Aw, can’t go to the scene. My most awaited brother, just want to see you excel in this competition!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[YYY, see her at a glance!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Hahaha, I just came here to watch my wife YYY]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Wow! The cameraman keeps on focusing on her. My wife YYY is so beautiful today! Please don’t move the lens!]</strong></p>
<p>The top twelve contestants all stood on stage awaiting their turn. Standing next to Yu Yaoyao was Qiu Dajian who’d later firmly secured second place. He was a famous little boy, with a masculine and tall body.  When he smiled, his smooth complexion revealed a pair of dimples. He was known to be a kind and handsome male artist.</p>
<p>Next to Qiu Dajian, in the third place, was Chen Ruixi known as the little girl. She looked somewhat similar to Hong Kong’s Golden Age Queen of the Jade because of her beautiful eyes that emanated the same aura and the way she carried herself on the stage, looked very natural.</p>
<p>The other nine contestants who’d entered the finals had all manifested outstanding appearance and aura. They also had great acting skills which just proved that they are worthy to enter the top 12 of the competition.</p>
<p>However, compared to Yu Yaoyao, they all seemed to be lacking something. They’d always watched the challenges each contestant had to overcome but only realized it now.</p>
<p>Today, as all of them stood together, almost everyone who was watching inside the hall as well on their computer had to admit a fact-</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao! She was so beautiful that all other contestants seemed to have lost their color!</p>
<p>Since they didn’t know what challenge they’d be thrown, Yu Yaoyao was just wearing casual clothes- a light-yellow flower bud dress with a white knitted cardigan. Her overall look was simple, sans any accessories and heavy makeup. However, when she smiled at the camera and the audience, she immediately captivated their hearts. Suddenly, the other contestants beside her, who were exquisite in appearance and well-dressed, became her leaves like a rose that has leaves on its stem.</p>
<p>Everyone couldn’t help but focus their attention on Yu Yaoyao, as they were attracted by her bright smile and celestial beauty.</p>
<p><strong>[I seem to hate this beauty before… why?]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[That smile is so beautiful! It’s blinding! &gt;.&lt;]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[She seems to be smiling at someone.]</strong></p>
<p>The audience quickly followed the moving camera lens and saw a handsome man sitting quietly beneath the stage, and a cute little boy waving at the camera excitedly but wearing a mask.</p>
<p><strong>[She is smiling at her husband and child! Aw, Boss Shen! And the cute little bun, oh!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Following the network cable, I want to crawl over and snatch this little baby!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Cute bun with dog ears! What a lovely family of three~]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Am I the only one who thinks that Mr. Shen has a serious face, and his wife and son don’t even care?]</strong></p>
<p>Some viewers of ‘In the Limelight’ didn’t know of the variety show ‘My Wife and I’. In that moment, they felt that there were comments that they were not familiar with,vit had them confused. Many were curious and asked for more information.</p>
<p><strong>[Go and watch ‘My Wife and I’! A funny family that is absolutely adorable!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The first episode was very funny~ Waiting for the second issue though. I’m bored so I decided to watch Yu Yaoyao in the finals. I don’t want to watch the others!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Throughout the episode Little Bun is my favorite!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen looks more masculine and husband material at home; he is a man of appearance but a slave to his wife, hahahaha!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Blow up this show, I’ve watched it three times already!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I replaced my cell phone wallpaper with a screenshot of this family- the one where YYY was too lazy to read the script, lalala~]</strong></p>
