            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 64 – A Steamed Bun’s Worries, Part 2</strong></p>
<p>Holding the plushie in his arms, the little fellow rolled happily onto the carpet to pull out the small tablet hidden inside the small tea table of his room.</p>
<p>His small face showed his eagerness to open the search box, his little fingers pressed the screen a few times, adjust it to voice input.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao.” Despite not knowing how to write yet, adding to that, he still hasn’t learned pinyin completely, he fortunately knew how to pronounce his mother’s name.</p>
<p>Although Yu Yaoyao is an 18th line actress, her name was still included in the list for the Pinyin input method. With this, the steamed stuffed bun could easily browse for the latest news in the internet about his mother.</p>
<p>He was holding the small tablet, scrolling through the web page with his little finger, as his small head rested on the big, soft plushie.</p>
<p>Although he does not know a lot of words, the steamed bun was knowledgeable about common words. For example, he was able to understand ‘<em>fiery live broadcast</em>’ of the fire for a while; another was, it was currently his mommy’s voting session…</p>
<p>When the little steamed bun saw the first new, he cleverly found the link for Yu Yaoyao’s live broadcast channel and hurriedly went it. But after a while, he watched the video and his happy face like the sun changed expressions like the weather; from sunny to cloudy, to a drizzle and finally to heavy rain.</p>
<p>Mama Xu was still preparing dinner when she heard a baby’s cry from the living room followed by the babysitter’s panicked voice trying to comfort.</p>
<p>“Young master, madam is working—not hungry, okay? Darling, let’s watch cartoons and wait for madam to come back.”</p>
<p>Xu Ma hastily wiped her hands and made a beeline to the source of the commotion. As soon as she walked in, she saw the little steamed bun’s whole face covered with tears. He was holding his doll, running around in circles in a frenzy while barefoot.</p>
<p>“Mommy…wuu…mommy…” he wailed incomprehensibly. This little guy often talks a lot during normal times, but when he breaks down and starts to cry, it’s as if his vocabulary disappears.</p>
<p>He could not express what he was crying about; he just chose to sob miserably for his mother.</p>
<p>The babysitter’s face turned white upon seeing another person in the room. She quickly clarified, ” Sister Xu, I just went out for a while to tidy up the young master’s toys. When I returned, he was already crying like this. Everything was just fine before.”</p>
<p>This frightened the babysitter so much. After all, not a moment has passed when she had gone, but the steamed bun had been crying heavily already.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong, who was in the middle of a company meeting, soon received a phone call from mama Xu.</p>
<p>“Crying at his mother in the video?” His eyebrows furrowed before he squeezed out a sentence, “I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>When Shen Yichong hurried home, he saw the little steamed bun holding both the small tablet and the snake plushie in his arms. The little person was pitifully lying on the sofa inside the living room as his babysitter and mama Xu tried to coax him.</p>
<p>The coffee table in front of them and on the sofa were all filled with toy planes and cars, but the little guy wouldn’t even spare it a glance.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Shen Rui? Do you miss you mom again?” Shen Yichong took off his suit and untied his tie before he went to his son.</p>
<p>Although the steamed bun has finally stopped crying, his pair of small eyes were red-rimmed. Upon Shen Yichong’s abrupt arrival, his small face did not look joyful at all. Instead, he was looking at Shen Yichong warily and angrily, like a wounded beast.</p>
<p>He held his mouth shut, refusing to answer his father’s question.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned and pointedly said, “Didn’t your mother just tell you this morning that she’ll leave work at five o’clock and be home by around seven o’clock?” knowing his wife’s itinerary very well.</p>
<p>The steamed bun only bowed his head and kept silent.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong helplessly looked at his eye watch. “It’s four o’clock now, and there are only three hours left. You can watch just two episodes of cartoons or online classes. After you eat and take a bath, your mom will be back.”</p>
<p>The corners of the steamed bun’s mouth finally twitched, and he raised his head to look at his father, but this time the unhappiness and indignation in his eyes were more serious.</p>
<p>“Don’t lose your temper,” Shen Yichong frowned at this. ‘You’re already five years old, and your mother can’t be at home with you all the time. Even at primary schools, kids can’t go home until it’s three o’clock. You have to learn to adapt.”</p>
<p>The steamed bun heard this and softly snorted in reply.</p>
