            <p><strong>Chapter 334 – Low IQ Characters (3)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Chen Jiao was stunned for a moment and then said helplessly, “What’s wrong? This morning…”</p>
<p>“When I hear kids crying, my scalp goes numb! God, they don’t stop crying, and I can’t comfort them anyway! I haven’t beaten them, so why are they crying? I’m so impatient and don’t want to be bullied anymore. I don’t want to take care of those brats. I’m not going tomorrow! I’m going to play that supporting role. I’ve experienced it. I promise that there will be no problems with my acting! Okay?”</p>
<p>As Chen Jiao listened to the complaints, he felt more suspicious than he had that morning.</p>
<p>She hated kids’ crying? She had no patience? When he’d met her back then, she’d comforted a crying child on the side of the road. She’d said that when she was a child, she often cried. She remembered how sad she’d been and hoped that someone would help her, so every time someone cried, she wanted to comfort them.</p>
<p>Had Ling Shuang changed over the past few years, or…</p>
<p>Chen Jiao frowned. He glanced at his phone and gave in, “Okay. I will inform the principal. Little Shuang, I happened to negotiate a “Beauty” magazine shoot for you. I will make an appointment for you in two days, and I will have the agent contact you,” he said before he anxiously hung up.</p>
<p>He was a little restless and felt that something was wrong. He didn’t dwell on it. He was only disturbed by the weird sense of disharmony in his heart. He picked up the script and reluctantly flipped through it.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was resting in the hotel. She had just got off work early and was lying comfortably playing with her cell phone, waiting for her husband and Little Bun to return.</p>
<p>Suddenly Ni Yi called, “Sister, big news! Have you checked Weibo?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao shook her head, “No, my wifey forbids me from checking Weibo.”  When she went on Weibo, she couldn’t help but update her status and interact with fans, so she had uninstalled the app.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong agreed with her decision. And after resisting Weibo for a week, he had taken her out to eat French food.</p>
<p>“Sister, let me tell you. You know the girl you didn’t like before? She failed! She bullied nursery school children. She’s on the trending topics,” Ni Yi said in one breath.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao didn’t like Ling Shuang, and as an agent, Ni Yi knew this.</p>
<p>She was determined not to cooperate with Ling Shuang in any announcements.</p>
<p>“What?” Yu Yaoyao sat up suddenly from the sofa.</p>
<p>There was no such plot in this story.</p>
<p>Child abuse?</p>
<p>She suddenly thought back to the final fate of Shen Rui, the Little Bun, in the original story. The author had never explained what had led to it… But was it related to Ling Shuang? After all, she was the ultimate beneficiary. But…</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao shook her head. Hypothetical scenarios that did not happen were meaningless. Now that she was here, Little Bun would never have problems again.</p>
<p>“What happened on Weibo? Little Yiyi, tell me.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi immediately explained the reason and sent her a link to the article.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao felt that it was indeed strange, so she clicked on the article and read it carefully. It turned out that a nursery school teacher had broken the news on Weibo. The teacher said that Ling Shuang, a female actor who was a nursery school teacher, wanted to experience teaching for the sake of acting.</p>
<p>But since the first day she’d been at the nursery school, she had been arrogant and refused to change the children’s pants or coax them to sleep. The tone of voice she used on the children was extremely inappropriate. That morning, she’d thrown a child’s craft project on the ground, stepped on it, and her harsh words had made the child cry. These nursery school teachers had never known that the beautiful actresses on TV were so arrogant and rude to children in real life</p>
<p>Such a person acting as a teacher was detrimental to the profession of teaching!</p>
<p>If this movie was released, she would speak on behalf of their nursery school teacher group, and she would definitely not watch it!</p>
<p>At the end of the article, they also attached a photo of the child’s trampled origami heart.</p>
<p>The comments on the Internet exploded.</p>
<p>When she finished reading, Yu Yaoyao touched her chin, “It can’t be. Does Ling Shuang even have a brain? Could the heroine and supporting character of this story have such a low IQ?”</p>
<p>“Sister, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Ah, nothing,” Yu Yaoyao waved her hand.</p>
<p>It was not difficult to defeat the heroine in this way. She was the only one like this in the world!</p>
<p>“By the way, sister, there’s some good news. Originally, Ling Shuang had a photoshoot with a magazine. Now because of this scandal, she can’t get it. The other party paid a high price and invited you. They’ve invited you before, but because you were on the set during that period, we declined. This time, they said they’ll pay three times what they paid last time!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s eyes lit up, but she quickly sighed. “They want me to clean up Ling Shuang’s mess… Do they think I am someone who lacks money?”</p>
<p>“Sister, you have no shortage of money, but if you go, you will definitely piss Ling Shuang off. Chen Jiao hasn’t scheduled her for a photoshoot for a year. This time, he shot her himself. It is easy to replace her! This magazine focuses on the market of successful white-collar workers, which coincides with the audience of your art film.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao grinned, “Alright. I guess I’ll think about it…” She would be able to irritate the little mistress. It was too generous!</p>
<p>Ling Shuang, who had heard about the news, was so angry that she punched her pillows, “Brother, why… I had a shoot for a magazine, as I said before… How can they suddenly change their minds?”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao’s face became gloomy. She was still questioning him.</p>
<p>“Little Shuang, you were too impatient. You really disappointed me. Where is the gentle and considerate you from before? What about the soft-spoken you? Look at what you have become!”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang was taken aback for a moment, and her fierce tone turned to panic, “Brother, listen to me…I didn’t, I didn’t…I’m still me!”</p>
