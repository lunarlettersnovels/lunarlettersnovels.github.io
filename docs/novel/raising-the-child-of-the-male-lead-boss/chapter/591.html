            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 162 – An Unexpected Gift (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Husband?” Yu Yaoyao blinked and looked at him in doubt.</p>
<p>“Do you really like these?” he asked, still looking at her.</p>
<p>Even though he had bought all the flowers from different flower shops around the city, the money he’d spent was not comparable to the price of a limited edition bag.</p>
<p>“Uh-huh ~” Yu Yaoyao nodded.</p>
<p>Soon, she looked again at the petals in the garden, smiling with content.  She even spread out her slender fingers and showed petals of different colors to her husband.</p>
<p>“Beautiful and fragrant. Oh, I remember! Flower baths were popular in ancient times and most women enjoy them. Flower baths moisturize the skin and make it smoother and whiter. When I walk around naked, my skin would not only look smooth but also smell good. How wonderful it would be to walk with a flowery scent…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong frowned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ni Yi, who was directed by Yu Yaoyao to take photos of her flying in the sea of flowers, was still hiding in the corner. He almost passed out upon hearing her words.</p>
<p>However, halfway through her blabberings, Yu Yaoyao frowned and reached out to her husband’s hands, pinching her chin.</p>
<p>“Husband, it hurts a little…” Her voice was as soft as silk, like a hook taking people’s souls away.</p>
<p><em>So ambiguous… This fairy!</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong suddenly felt that his fingernail scalded her skin and immediately withdrew it.</p>
<p>Ni Yi next to them who felt his heart was in his throat suddenly escaped from the couple. Meanwhile, an unfazed Yu Yaoyao continued to list some usefulness of the flowers in housekeeping.</p>
<p>“Now, with the remaining flowers, I will check on the Internet to see if there are any recipes about making flower sauce.  It’s sweet and sour taste must be delicious! Oh, when the flowers are dried, maybe I can turn it into flower pillows… I might even attempt to create facial flower masks, ahh~ I will definitely become the fairest of them all,  Husband ~”</p>
<p>Shen Yi Chong: “…”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, Husband. I have prepared a mysterious birthday gift for you. You must come home early that day.” Yu Yaoyao’s eyes flickered as she glanced at Shen Yichong, who also seemed to have forgotten that his birthday was near. She felt a little sympathetic for the man.</p>
<p><em>It’s his birthday yet he doesn’t even remember. Just like her, 5 years ago, no one cared about her birthday.</em></p>
<p>Shen Yichong was confused for a moment. “Gift?”</p>
<p><em>Not only did she remember his birthday but was also planning to give him a gift?!</em></p>
<p>He instantly squatted and stared at the sea of flowers in the garden in shock.</p>
<p>He thought a second ago that what he did was enough to celebrate her success in the photoshoot, but now… upon hearing what his wife said… He already knew that Chen Lin should go to the jewelry store and buy a new set of jewelry for her!</p>
<p>“Uhm, yes!” Yu Yaoyao took out her phone and clicked multiple times.  “The shop owner said it will be delivered next week!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s eyes shone like a gem. This would be the first time he’d be receiving a present from her! Because of everything he did for her, she was able to work and earn money herself, and therefore she wanted to at least return the favor and make him happy.</p>
<p>There was a sudden rush of heat in his chest!</p>
<p>Looking at the dazzling smile flashing in front of him at this moment, he could only infer that… <em>she had really changed! Since the hospitalization, she had become a completely new person.</em></p>
<p>He looked at her delicate face, and there was an immense rejoice in his heart. The concussion may have left a scar on her face but that did not make her less beautiful.</p>
<p>“Husband, please look forward to it. It will be a huge surprise~” Yu Yaoyao pursed her lips.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong lowered his head and chuckled softly. “Okay, I’m looking forward to it.” Reaching out, he took off the leaves from her hair.</p>
<p>“Come in, it’s getting windy,” he said, in a soft voice that nobody had ever heard before.</p>
<p>Soon, they both went to school to pick up Little Rui and returned home to eat dinner together.</p>
<p>The family of three sat together at the dining table and ate their dinner first, before enjoying the cake Yu Yaoyao bought. Shen Yichong couldn’t help but smile tenderly as he noticed the mother and son giggling at each other, both with icing on their face.</p>
<p>And throughout the night, his smile did not fade.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>A week later, the first episode of “My Wife and I” premiered on Aiku’s network platform. VIP members and important guests were given the opportunity to watch for one month in advance the super-long unedited episode of each guest couple.</p>
<p>In the first group, Shen Yichong and Yu Yaoyao’s episode was the first to be broadcast. This was because of her appearance in ‘In the Limelight’, the fact that she was CEO Shen Yichong’s wife and the most recently popular artist in the trending topic. The decision was also worth it since the couple’s episode was the most awaited of all and had attracted the attention of many. The total duration of the video was three and a half hours. As soon as the opening theme song of the program played, screams and enthusiastic barrages appeared.</p>
<p><strong>[I’ve come here to support this family, so I look forward to it!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Mr. Shen’s daily life, I want to see for myself!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I wonder what kind of home Little Yao yao has!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Pudding and potato chips are ready, haha, for now, distractions are not welcome!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Guys! Register now and watch this most-awaited episode!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[It’s certainly surprising to hear that they’ll broadcast a three and a half hour unedited episode!]</strong></p>
<p>Zhao Xiaomeng, one of YYY’s fans, was sitting nervously and excitedly in front of her computer screen waiting for the episode to air. She was deeply moved and amazed at how Yu Yaoyao had helped her during the first phase of the competition of the variety show ‘In the Limelight’ which luckily made her secure a spot in the Top 20 of the show.  Since then, she had become one of Yu Yaoyao’s top fans.</p>
<p>Throughout the broadcast, she couldn’t help but marvel at Yu Yaoyao’s incredible beauty and talent. And the more she appeared on screen, the more she shone on the stage. However, Zhao Xiaomeng felt a bit regretful as this show was not Yu Yaoyao’s solo show. Nonetheless, she was excited knowing that her goddess-like beauty would be seen by the entire China for three and a half hours. Soon, she picked up a pack of cucumber-flavored potato chips, opened it, and watched the episode with great anticipation.</p>
