<p><strong>Chapter 458</strong></p>
<p>“Well, Sister… Yao, let me summarize.”</p>
<p>Given that they used the same brand for sanitary napkins, Ye Yun was bolder to communicate with Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“The goals we want to achieve are… First, to maintain or even increase the ratings for at least four episodes later. Second, you don’t go out to shoot. Even if you’re on camera, it shall not exceed an hour.” Ye Yun confirmed.</p>
<p>“Yes. I could go out, but the drive must be within ten minutes,” Yu Yaoyao answered, getting a little excited.</p>
<p>She immediately took out her small notebook under the coffee table and showed it out to her top fan. “Xiao Yunyun, I thought of a few ways before you came.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun immediately got closer. Yaoyao was not only beautiful and friendly, but she was also smart and motivated. She couldn’t wait to look at the notebook. But in a second, the smile on her face stiffened.</p>
<p><em>‘Forget about the writing… what are these…?’</em></p>
<p>The paper said,<strong> “Live eating show… Live yoga… makeup tutorials… Plant flowers with the housekeeper… Korean shows live watch party.”</strong></p>
<p>Ye Yun got a headache as soon as she saw it.</p>
<p>All these activities wouldn’t require Yaoyao to go out, but these were what ordinary internet celebrities would do. Was Yaoyao an ordinary internet celebrity? Of course not! Even if she wanted to do a live broadcast, there must be innovation.</p>
<p>The shortest was next year, and the longest might be four or five years… As long as Yaoyao was filming every year, it was very likely that she would win the best actress award. If the best actress was doing the same thing as the internet celebrities, that would just have her identity downgraded!</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, these wouldn’t work,” Ye Yun said with a shake of her head. “You’re breastfeeding, so you can’t just eat snacks, right? How can you broadcast new recipes if you have to maintain eating proper meals in a day?”</p>
<p>“For yoga, everyone can watch videos from professional teachers. Make-up… do you have a cosmetic endorsement? Planting flowers, um, that will affect your image… It’s also impossible to broadcast Korean dramas. You do not have the authorization.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun shot down all the ideas one by one. In the end, Yu Yaoyao was the one that was having a headache.</p>
<p>“Dayao, recall carefully. Is there anything you want to do in particular, but have been busy with filming and had no time to do it?” Ye Yun enlightened her slowly. “I think we could try to start thinking from two sources. One is your dream, and the other is your wish.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Yu Yaoyao blinked when she heard this. These two words were a bit complicated and she seldom thought about them before.</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s face glowed, “Sister Yao, as your fan… top fan, I must say that your performance in front of the camera is full of motivation.”</p>
<p>She had also been scolded by her boss before, but seeing Yaoyao’s persistence, she also told herself to persevere no matter what!</p>
<p>“You always make the fans feel a positive energy,” she began. “I used to think that the fans were young, and it would be very difficult being the vice president. But I later found that the fans were still relatively manageable. Other fans might scold and trample others, but many of our YY fans don’t. Not only do they not create trouble, but they will also follow you and Shen Rui to study hard and earnestly.”</p>
<p>“Sister Yao, this is your power as an idol,” she earnestly said.  “While you can’t bring your children to travel around with you for now, I think that’s okay too. Maybe we could try to show your personal charm by doing a few episodes at home or nearby places. Maybe about you working hard to realize your dreams.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao opened her mouth wide. The more Ye Yun talked, the more she felt that this could be done.</p>
<p>“The purpose of the show is to convey the correct view. You can tell everyone that it doesn’t matter if you fail, as long as you work harder next time,” Ye Yun finished.</p>
<p>“Ah…” Yu Yaoyao looked at her. Then, she looked at Little Bun. She blushed on a rare occasion. “Xiao Yunyun, what you said makes sense, and it makes me feel very touched too. But I have a question…”</p>
<p>“Go on.” Ye Yun listened with bated breath.</p>
<p>“Well, my dreams and wishes seemed to have all come true.” Yu Yaoyao blinked at her. “I don’t seem to have any failures that I can show to everyone.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun almost bit her tongue. She wished she could hammer herself in the head.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that Yaoyao was a winner in life!</p>
<p>It was not fake that Mr. Shen really doted on his wife. She was married and had children. She was rich and capable. She was also beautiful!</p>
<p>Why would she have any regrets? Talking to Yaoyao about her dream was meaningless, because she had already achieved all of them!</p>
<p>“However, after being reminded by you, I think it can be done, just by changing a little…” Yu Yaoyao continued. “Maybe… I can help people reach for their dreams.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun was so surprised that she almost thought she heard it wrong.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao quickly took out her phone excitedly, and dialled a number, “Darling, do you need my help to train any young rookies? What about trainees? I would have all the food, lodging, and a work schedule figured out! I can give you a special price!”</p>
<p>Ye Yun: “!”</p></div>
