<p>“Interested my *ss!” Fang Qiuye blurted out angrily.</p>
<p>“He said he couldn’t get used to the wrong translation I posted on Weibo. He even said I was misleading the young people! Gosh, I even deleted the post, and it has become only visible to me, but he <em>saved</em> it, so he can’t turn a blind eye! He even says he’s gonna study how to translate them elegantly and decently, since it’s a very interesting research topic. Don’t you think he went too far?!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye couldn’t stop her anger once she started talking about him.</p>
<p>“I changed my translations five times, and now I still haven’t passed the first chapter… He said that my vocabulary is too limited, and I should accumulate more… In a few months,  I should have a second version,” she lamented, “I…I…I really think he’s a devil!”</p>
<p>In this way, she definitely couldn’t finish translating  two hundred chapters in this life!</p>
<p>Ye Yun almost laughed when she heard this. But bystanders always see the situation the clearest. She directly pointed out the key points.</p>
<p>“If he wants to do research on this, he could definitely go to some other authors. Why must he stick to you?” Ye Yun began. “If he doesn’t like your translation, he could just edit for you and let you post it to Weibo. I think he became addicted to teaching students! But you can refuse his request, right? Didn’t you already have a lot of pressure to update the novel?”</p>
<p>Ye Yun was amused. “You really have great patience to attend to his request on changing your translation multiple times.”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye’s expression changed. She’s right! Why did she have to entertain him? Was it because she had been staying up late lately, so that her brain was no longer working well?</p>
<p>“Well… Probably because I am also a responsible person. I’ll persevere till the end once I start something,” she replied brazenly.</p>
<p>That’s right. She must have done it because she had morals!</p>
<p>“I also need to teach Yaoyao, so I thought I should learn English properly! Sister Yun, let me tell you, I suspect that my English ability now has surpassed my previous peak! Except for my poor English oral skills, my reading and writing skills have improved!”</p>
<p>Ye Yun shook her head on the spot. The next time they would meet, she might be bewitched by Teacher Gong to improve on her oratory skills. He would definitely let her know what is meant by ‘learning is a lifelong journey’…</p>
<p>It seemed like this girl still hadn’t realized the fact, yet.</p>
<p>“Fine,” Ye Yun patted Fang Qiuye’s shoulder, “You can arrange the time yourself, and buy more textbooks. In case you need it.”</p>
<p>If she had more appointments in the future, there would be less time for her to write.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know! I now wake up early and memorize vocabulary for half an hour. Then, I would think about the plot while I have my breakfast. After that, I’ll start writing at 8am, while I try to start translating them at 11, and have lunch at 12…”</p>
<p>Ye Yun didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, “Remember to pay attention to your body, and don’t always eat takeout.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I go to the university cafeteria for lunch and get that d*mn teacher to correct my translation. After that, I pack dinner home from the cafeteria.” Speaking of this, Fang Qiuye felt a little better. “The cafeteria food is cheaper than takeout, and there is more variety. There seems to be some subsidy discount if I use his teacher card. I can get two meals a day by spending less than 20 Yuan, hehe.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun’s mouth twitched. Seemed like she was worrying for nothing. It looked like the two were already dating! They even went on a date every day! She was speechless with this sudden love in the air.</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s finally our turn! Sister Yun, let’s go in~ Today I have to take a good rest and appreciate Yaoyao’s works!”</p>
<p>Fang Qiuye excitedly pulled Ye Yun. Ye Yun followed silently.</p>
<p>The theme of ‘I Am a Killer’ leaned towards a more solemn, noir vibe. Anyone who had seen the introduction to the film knew that this was a story that would make people cry.</p>
<p>Xiao Yi was the heroine played by Yu Yaoyao. While she was performing her last killing mission, she fell in love with the person she must not love – her target. She was swaying between love and her final mission of breaking away from the organization. In the end, she chose to obey the voice of her inner consciousness and escape with her target.</p>
<p>But in the end, she discovered that the man who made her give up everything was actually a policeman who wanted to hunt down and take down the organization.  From the very beginning, the story was doomed to tragedy. While the man also fell in love with her, he also sent her to prison in the end.</p>
<p>The movie also carried out a message that all wrongdoings would be punished. But to watch it in one go, the audience absolutely needed to have their tissues ready.</p>
<p>“I’m here to cry out loud to relieve my pressure. I also want to use this chance to bash the male protagonist and vent my anger.”</p>
<p>As soon as they sat down, Fang Qiuye took out two large packs of tissues from her small bag and passed one to Ye Yun.</p>
<p>“Now, I finally know why many students like to scold their teachers!” Ye Yun exclaimed. “Gosh, what a hard life!”</p>
<p>Teacher Gong who was sitting behind her, but she didn’t know because of the dim lighting: “…”</p>
<p>The premiere officially began. Fang Qiuye, who had been chattering all the time, also quieted down.</p></div>
