            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 149 – My Husband is a Bully (2)</strong></p>
<p>The little bun simultaneously patted his mother’s back with his cute hand a few times, and withdrew it to stuff noodles into his mouth.</p>
<p><em>How can there be such a thoughtful child!?</em></p>
<p>Zhou Qiu, who was monitoring the camera, looked at Shen Yichong, who has a dazed expression.</p>
<p>Why is it that Shen Yichong, who already has a very successful career, isn’t short of everything? In addition to his wealth, he had an attractive wife and even a cute, thoughtful child!</p>
<p><em>According to his background information, this child should be only less than five, right?</em></p>
<p>Zhou Qiu remembered that when his son was five and a half years old, his mother still has to feed him. It would always take an hour of feeding and chasing before his son could finish a bowl of rice. Feeding his son was almost akin to fighting in a war.</p>
<p><em>But this little guy, Shen Rui, is not only capable of feeding himself but also knows how to sympathize and take care of his mommy while eating! What kind of supernatural baby is this? How does Mr. Shen teach his child?</em></p>
<p>Zhou Qiu was lost in his thoughts. And in a blink of an eye, the little bun has finished eating the small bowl of noodles, and did not even leave a piece of green onion in his bowl.</p>
<p>Soon, it was time for the little bun to depart for the zoo. Although there was some reluctance in the little bun’s face, he obediently went to the zoo with Chen Lin.</p>
<p>After Yu Yaoyao sent her affectionate farewell to the little bun, she instantly laid down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s start filming,” she said, staring at the director.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu wiped out the sweat from his forehead and said, “You can do anything that you usually do at home…”</p>
<p>“I usually lie down like this,” Yu Yaoyao raised her small face and looked at the ceiling with a deep sigh, “Look at the sky, look at the wall, I usually sit after eating, this way the food will slowly digest and it’s also comfortable to lie down…”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu opened his mouth in shock and looked at Shen Yichong next to him, asking for help.</p>
<p>“Read the script.” Shen Yichong understood the director’s eyes asking for help and looked at Yu Yaoyao. Seeing her lying down, he took a small blanket to cover her exposed legs.</p>
<p>“Are you finished familiarizing your lines in Zhou Qiu’s new drama?” Shen Yichong asked his wife. “There will be a final stage for ‘In the Limelight’. What preparations did you make? Have you finished reading the ‘Theoretical basis for a stage performance’?”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu’s formerly passionate heart suddenly turned cold. How did the sweet interaction he had anticipated from the couple instantly turned into a college entrance examination review?</p>
<p>Director Zhou Qiu couldn’t help but stare at Shen Yichong with bitterness who questioned his wife, Yu Yaoyao, like a professor.</p>
<p>At first, he felt that when Yu Yaoyao lied down on the couch, there would only be a small chance for them to film sweet moments between the couple. But the moment Mr. Shen started the academic conversation, it only extinguished that small hope inside to record gut-stirring scenes.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, after hearing the barrage of questions from her callous husband, instantly felt distressed. She pitifully clutched her little blanket and struggled for a reason to decline. “Can’t I… not now? The production staff told me that we’re only going to be doing a photoshoot for the drama teasers tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s expression instantly turned colder. “If you don’t read the script, how are you going to properly portray the character’s role throughout the photoshoot? What expressions are you going to convey?” Then he ruthlessly added, “The director has great expectations from you. In order not to fail him, you need to pass the test at least.”</p>
<p>This made Yu Yaoyao shut her beautiful eyes now filled with despair. She stood up helplessly, and walked to the edge of the coffee table to pull out her script.</p>
<p>“Practice your lines while I am doing the dishes.” Shen Yichong leaned over from behind her and reached out to open the script she was holding. From a distance, it seemed like he was embracing her from behind the way his buff limbs went over her petite arms. However, what he said next ruined the atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Practice your lines starting from this page up to this page, back to back. If you make a mistake, you will be punished with an additional ten minutes of yoga session tonight.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>She almost felt a little warm and wanted to turn around to hug him, but it seems Shen Yichong had a penchant for spoiling the mood. It was like a bolt that came out from the blue!</p>
