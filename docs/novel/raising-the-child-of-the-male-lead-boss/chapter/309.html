            <p><strong>Chapter 454</strong></p>
<p>Shen Yichong returned to the company the next day. After dealing with a lot of work that was waiting for his decision, he had a face-to-face meeting with Ye Yun during lunch hour.</p>
<p>Ye Yun was very nervous at first. But after watching several episodes of ‘Welcome to My House’, she found that Mr. Shen was someone who only looked cold on the outside. When facing Yu Yaoyao and Little Bun, he was just an ordinary slave to his wife and children.</p>
<p>In fact, Ye Yun had already accepted Guangxin’s offer. She would be joining the strategy department in a week as the deputy manager. But seeing Shen Yichong, she couldn’t help but ask the question that had been circling in her mind repeatedly for the past two months.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shen, why do you think highly of me?”</p>
<p>Her current position was equivalent to directly joining the company’s management, and she would hold part of the company stocks as soon as she joined the company. Along with all the benefits, her annual salary was doubled from her previous job.</p>
<p>When she talked to Chen Lin before, he also mentioned that Guangxin wouldn’t pay much for the annual salary. Their pay mainly relied on their annual bonuses and dividends to the employees. That was, the total salary paid to her may be more than a million. In a blink of an eye, she became a gold-collar worker.</p>
<p>“I’m very curious, why would you have the company accept me before you even met me?”</p>
<p>She had gotten such an important position so easily.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong pursed his lips. He pushed his phone over when he heard the question. “You should have the answer in your heart.”</p>
<p>On his screen was the Weibo homepage. With a glance, Ye Yun saw the account id was ‘My wife is doing pretty good lately’!</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. It was truly him!</p>
<p>She had always kept her real age a secret in the group.</p>
<p>While most of the fans were young girls in their twenties, some of them were mothers. Given her age, she could be considered as the middle-aged fan in the group. At the company, she also never mentioned about her chasing a star, in case her subordinates and colleagues laughed at her. Little did she expect that something she didn’t put her best foot into had helped solve her career problem!</p>
<p>“You’ve performed well in critical management several times,” Shen Yichong said. “Foresight, luck, character – it’s all right.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong wasn’t speaking a lot, but Ye Yun still guessed the underlying message.. Did he mean she had a good standard because she was a fan of his wife?</p>
<p>Ye Yun swallowed her saliva. He was simply a loyal fan of his wife…</p>
<p>But who didn’t like being praised? Ye Yun also felt that she had to do something big so she wouldn’t disappoint Mr. Shen!</p>
<p>After a short conversation, Chen Lin, who was standing next to him, came over to interrupt their conversation. “Boss, the next meeting will be held in ten minutes.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong nodded towards Ye Yun, “Sorry, I’ve to go. Please have Chen Lin accompany you to the Strategy Department.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun quickly stood up. After Shen Yichong left, the temperature in the room felt significantly higher, and even the air felt fresher.</p>
<p>Ye Yun smiled at Chen Lin who was standing all the time, “Thank you for your hard work.”</p>
<p>Secretly sighing in her heart, she thought, Yaoyao was no ordinary idol. How impressive was she to be the only one who could survive under Mr. Shen’s icy aura! She had even swung his arms around like a little raccoon several times in the variety shows. Yaoyao was indeed super courageous!</p>
<p>Ye Yun was emotional. She couldn’t help but take out her phone when she entered the elevator. She clicked on the fan group chat and typed excitedly.</p>
<p><em>[Sisters, I’ve got accepted into the nest of my idol!]</em></p>
<p>Chen Lin next to her spoke abruptly when she was feeling excited. “Miss Ye, since you won’t start the job until next week, I wonder if you have any arrangements for this week?”</p>
<p>Ye Yun was stunned. She shook her head, “No, nothing as of right now.”</p>
<p>She had her last day at her previous company yesterday, and she was planning to take a week off. While she did think about travelling, she hadn’t found a companion.</p>
<p>“Boss just sent me a message. If you’re interested, would you want to be Sister Yao’s consultant for a week? Of course, the Human Resources Department will give you extra pay for that.” Chen Lin smiled.</p>
<p>Ye Yun opened her mouth wide, “Yao… Yaoyao!? Would that be okay?!”</p>
<p>She was totally a fan of Yaoyao!</p>
<p>“I thought someone who’s a fan of the artist could never be their assistant. People might make irrational decisions when that happens!!”</p>
<p>Her heart was pounding uncontrollably.</p>
<p>“All of our new employees would go through company training after they joined the company. Being an artist’s assistant or manager for a week could help them quickly understand the real workflow of the entertainment industry. This way, it also gives them exposure to their future work.” Chen Lin helpfully explained. “Miss Ye, although your department might not need to have direct contact with any of the artists, all strategic decisions are still closely related to the entertainment industry and each artist.”</p>
<p>“Sister Yao is also one of the company’s artists. And since you were hired, you need to overcome making irrational decisions from your high emotions,” Chen Lin said while leading her to the Strategy Department.</p>
<p>Ye Yun began to tremble. The real Yaoyao!</p>
<p>“If you have any difficulties, I can tell the boss to arrange someone else for Sister Yao…”</p>
<p>“No, no, I will try. I can try!” Ye Yun called him out immediately.</p>
<p>Chen Lin was glad to hear that. “Then I’ll take you to our boss’s house after we have a tour here.”</p>
<p>Ye Yun was stunned. They weren’t meeting through a phone call…? She would be meeting Yaoyao directly at her house?! That was so soon!!</p>
<p>Oh gosh, her poor heart couldn’t take it anymore!</p>
