            <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Chapter 15 – Let The Director Become A Little Clear-Headed (3)</b></p>
<p>Ni Yi’s face didn’t look too good. <i>What Little Yiyi?</i></p>
<p>But now that there was no time for nonsense, he sighed and turned impatiently in the same place. “Director Li Bo is strict about the company’s image, that’s why he’s now opposed to it. He’ll give you time to recuperate but he won’t wait for you to recover.”</p>
<p>“Shameless!” Yu Yaoyao patted her thighs angrily. “This shameless man! How could he go back on his word!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi merely replied. “He has not signed a contract yet, so we are not protected by the law.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao could only stare. After all, she didn’t understand these laws!  The only thing she knew: In the wild, only the biggest can stand on the top of the food chain!</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that I had been inserted?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi didn’t answer, but Yu Yaoyao slammed the table excitedly. “Yes! I went through the back door. It’s an unspoken rule made by humans!”</p>
<p>Ni Yi glanced at her in fear. “Sister, are you all right?”</p>
<p><i>How heavy was the blow actually?</i></p>
<p>“Little Yiyi, my husband is the boss of the company, isn’t that right? Then that only means he is one of the investors of the show. This son of a b*tch director actually had the guts to kick me out so casually. Pah, in his big dreams!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao snorted. “If I want to act, then I will act.”</p>
<p>“You send the director my wedding photo with Shen Yichong to wake him up!”</p>
<p>“Sister.” Ni Yi swallowed his saliva. For so many years that they had been together, she had never been like this; it’s like she was a whole new person.</p>
<p>“The gossip about you and film emperor Chen is all over the city, and everyone says you’re getting a divorce. However, the boss did not come forward to clarify, and even after 24 hours, there’s still no notice from his lawyer.”</p>
<p>“Who said that?” Yu Yaoyao narrowed her eyes. “I won’t get divorced; I’ll never get a divorce in my life.”</p>
<p><i>F*ck! If she gets divorced, she won’t be able to have a part in the play. These humans are cunning!</i></p>
<p>“Besides, I’m so beautiful,” Yu Yaoyao opened the Weibo homepage. “I was on the hot search the other day. Doesn’t he know how much traffic it can bring to the TV show? Can’t the director do math?”</p>
<p><i>Stupider than a snake!</i></p>
<p>Ni Yi wiped his sweat. “Then it’s your fault for exposing your private matters…”</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Yu Yaoyao’s slanted eyes widened. The light reflected on her eyes and this beautiful sight made Ni Yi swallow his words back.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. It’s because of your beauty.” He continued after some while. “… But sister, the reporter has evidence. Is it really okay? Are you and the boss not really going to get divorced?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao smiled and pointed to the opposite chair. “You just be patient.”</p>
<p>Two minutes later, Shen Yichong, dressed in a black trench coat, led along with a little bun that had changed into a Doraemon jacket, came down from the second floor.</p>
<p>His eyes glanced coldly past the people standing in the restaurant.</p>
<p>In an instant, Ni Yi shrunk his neck. “Boss.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong gave a slight nod and lifted his glare towards Yu Yaoyao. “It’s time to go.”</p>
<p>“All right.” Yu Yaoyao winked at the fat man. “Little Yiyi, your brother-in-law and I are taking our child to the playground today. Don’t come to me if you need anything. We’ll be out for two days and… one night.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi almost bit his tongue. “Oh!”</p>
<p>He glanced at Shen Yichong’s cold face and found that the opposite party was only expressionless but did not refute it.</p>
<p><i>Then… her suicide, cheating, and divorce had all been rumors?</i></p>
