            <p><strong>Chapter 414</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>But on the day they bought the hot searches, the fans and readers of the original novel were harshly criticizing the movie.</p>
<p><em>[What kind of b*llsh!t special effects are these?]</em></p>
<p><em>[It’s not even worth my five cents!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I wanted to mock this lion when I watched the movie in the cinema. The protagonist looked like he was walking a cat! He didn’t look like a man who had a big beast as a pet at all.]</em></p>
<p><em>[The director is a dumbass. He destroyed my imagination towards the end of the original novel!]</em></p>
<p>More and more people started criticizing the movie.</p>
<p>Wansheng’s marketing department was soaked through with sweat.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, the audience needed an outlet. People will only want to watch the movie in the cinema if others are talking about it,” they tried to comfort themselves.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled dismissively when he saw the hot search that day.</p>
<p>The faces of the entire production team, and Wansheng’s team, turned pale when the box office results came out the next day.</p>
<p>By the second day, the box office had dropped to 50 million, which was 50% less than the premiere the day before. And it was a Saturday. Weekends were meant to be the peak days for people to watch movies, but instead, the box office had dropped significantly.</p>
<p>Wansheng’s marketing department was panicked, they paid to have the hot search brought down from the day before.</p>
<p>Little did they know the protests from the netizens and the book fans had pushed the hot searches up again.</p>
<p><em>[How dare you remove the hot search! You can’t even take the criticism for destroying the original work! You are a piece of sh!t who only knows how to make money!]</em></p>
<p><em>[The standard of beauty in the whole film was so terrible that I don’t even want to complain about it! The pet lion was awful, but the rest was even more unsightly.]</em></p>
<p><em>[I didn’t want to watch the movie after seeing the trailer, but my girlfriend insisted that we go to the theater. Who knew it would be this bad! I rated it one-star!]</em></p>
<p><em>[This hot search should be ranked at the top. Terrible movie!]</em></p>
<p><em>[No one can take this hot search down!]</em></p>
<p>Everyone was very angry.</p>
<p>Wansheng’s marketing department didn’t even have the time to pity themselves.</p>
<p>Why were they not allowed to withdraw a hot search they’d paid for? They never could have expected results like this.</p>
<p>The box office on the first day had filled them with confidence and even a little pride. That was the whole reason they had decided to come up with this marketing strategy in the first place. Who knew it was destined to be a failure?</p>
<p>Even the production team was furious about Wansheg’s marketing strategy. They called and gave them a good scolding as well.</p>
<p>In the end, Wansheng finally managed to withdraw the hot search after paying double the price.</p>
<p>But even so, it did not restore the film’s reputation. The next day, the box office dropped to only 10 million, and the film’s Douban score fell below 60.</p>
<p>During the following days, the movie was ranked below a romance film that had been aired for 12 weeks in a row. A film Guangxin had invested in.</p>
<p>In the end, the box office totaled 250 million Yuan in the first week and dropped to 100 million Yuan in the second week. The total continued to fall until it became something too horrible to even look at.</p>
<p>In the end, not even a sci-fi production with a broad fan base originating from the original novel, celebrity directors, a box office leading male and female role, could save the film’s box office.</p>
<p>The vigorous marketing strategy and strong recommendations the marketing carried out had now become the joke of the industry.</p>
<p>This was enough to make everyone see the real reason behind Shen Yichong’s withdrawal at the time.</p>
<p>Guangxin was not facing any financial crisis. Instead, they had not been optimistic about the invest and had decided to withdraw from a project that was destined to fail and give them no return.</p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen is so reliable!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Mr. Shen: I’m very serious when it comes to earning money to feed my wife and my children!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Unbelievable! Mr. Shen predicted this perfectly!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Chen Qiao, do you regret your decision now? You deserve to lose money for abandoning a talented and reliable boss!]</em></p>
<p>The production and distribution cost of ‘Allure’ was well over 600 million, but the final gross box office was less than 400 million.</p>
<p>As Shen Yichong had predicted, the investors lost nearly half their investment!</p>
<p>In the end, not only did Wansheng not make any money, but they also became a joke.</p>
<p>Du Jingya, the supporting female lead, was criticized because of Wansheng’s improper marketing. Feeling wronged and angry, she terminated the contract with Wansheng, even though she had to bear the costs for breaching the contract.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long after that that Wansheng heard Guangxin had picked her up, and that she had signed a contract with them. Wansheng could have vomited blood.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Soon, Yu Yaoyao’s family welcomed their second batch of guests; her best first Xiao Sisi, Da Fu, and their children.</p>
<p>Shen Rui was very interested in Ren Sitong’s youngest daughter, and he was always around her. Sometimes, he would stop and stare at Yu Yaoyao’s belly.</p>
<p>“Mummy, will my little sister be as cute as Xiao Guo? Will she be soft and fragrant?” Little Bun obviously wanted a sister.</p>
<p>His words made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>Ren Sitong patted his shoulder. “She will be. Your father has good genes, your sister won’t be ugly.”</p>
<p>It was said that daughters usually took after their fathers in looks, but this was the first time Little Bun had heard anything of the sort.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth wide in astonishment, as if he was horrified. “She’s going to look like my father! Why?” he said, glanced at this father, then lip his bottom lip, looking depressed.</p>
<p>His father was tall with a solid, muscular body and a cold face. He wasn’t cute at all!</p>
<p>Little Bun looked at Xiao Guo, then at his own soft, sweet mother. He threw himself into her arms, aggrieved. “Mommy, can’t my little sister look like me?”</p>
<p>Everyone burst out laughing.</p>
