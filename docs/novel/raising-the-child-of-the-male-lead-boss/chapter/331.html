            <p><strong>Chapter 432</strong></p>
<p>He now loved and appreciated Yu Yaoyao more than any other artist. But soon, there was a loud noise on the other side of the phone. There was finally a voice from the other side after Qi Hang greeted again. But different from what he and everyone in the live broadcast room imagined, a childish voice sounded!</p>
<p>“Hello? Uncle, hi!”</p>
<p>The voice sounded childish, but the pronunciation was clear and loud. All those who had seen the variety show and those who knew Yu Yaoyao’s family reacted instantly. It was Little Bun, Shen Rui!</p>
<p>The YY fans in the live broadcast room were suddenly excited! This was simply a surprise~</p>
<p>Watching the live broadcast gave them the illusion that they were talking to Little Bun. This cute voice made them excited all of a sudden.</p>
<p><em>[Naw, it was our baby who answered the phone!? Hello, baby!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Baby Rui’s even in charge of answering the phone at home? Why are you so sensible!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I cannot, I suddenly remembered Little Bun’s short legs. They were so cute~]</em></p>
<p><em>[Being able to hear the live voice of Little Bun made this all worth it!]</em></p>
<p>On the podium, Qi Hang also recognized Little Bun’s voice. He had seen this child a long time ago. Shen Rui often visited the crew with Shen Yichong, and he got acquainted with many of the crew members. After all, Little Bun was now not afraid of strangers, and he was really cute.</p>
<p>“Xiao Rui? Where’s your mother? Can you get your mother on the phone? I am Uncle Qi Hang.”</p>
<p>Director Qi did not forget to introduce himself, for fear that the little guy would hang up the phone mercilessly.</p>
<p>“Uncle Qi~” Little Bun greeted him politely again.</p>
<p>Then, through the microphone, a breaking news was casted on the spot.</p>
<p>“My mom can’t come to the phone. She’s giving birth to my little sister.”</p>
<p>The scene suddenly became noisy.</p>
<p>The live broadcast room was overwhelmed with comments in an instant.</p>
<p><em>[She’s due soon?!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Oh my god! Our second baby is coming out to accept the award!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Wow! Did our baby want to rush out because she knows this is an important moment for her mommy?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is our baby on her way?!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is she in labour?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is Yaoyao giving birth to her baby on the award ceremony live broadcast? Oh my goodness!]</em></p>
<p>Qi Hang didn’t expect such a coincidence, and he was a little stunned, “Xiao Rui, are you in the hospital? Is your father by your side? Let your father get on the phone.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s other identity was Yu Yaoyao’s boss. At this time, it’s okay to have him explain or make an award testimonial over the phone on behalf of Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>“My daddy’s not there either. He’s accompanying mommy to give birth to my little sister.” Little Bun explained immediately.</p>
<p>Everyone finally understood now. The timing was so wrong. Yu Yaoyao was giving birth when she won the award, and Shen Yichong was accompanying her in the delivery room. Little Bun obviously couldn’t enter the delivery room and had to wait outside. Since adults couldn’t bring their mobile phones into the delivery room, they are kept with Little Bun.</p>
<p>“Um……” Qi Hang didn’t know what else he could say. “Then, are you alone? Is there anyone else by your side?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Uncle Shen Lin, Uncle Ni Yi, Uncle Housekeeper, Granny Song, Granny Lin…” Little Bun counted.</p>
<p>Qi Hang’s eyes lit up. He had met Ni Yi, Yu Yaoyao’s manager.</p>
<p>“Let Uncle Ni Yi come to the phone…”</p>
<p>But Little Bun seemed to have missed what he said, and he even tried to chat with Qi Hang. “Uncle Qi, did my mom win an award? Best supporting actress?”</p>
<p>Even he knew about the award. There was a lot of laughter in the live broadcast room and there was applause at the scene.</p>
<p>Qi Hang smiled and nodded immediately, “Yes, your mother’s wonderful, and she won the best supporting actress award. Uncle called to tell her the good news.”</p>
<p>Little Bun was obviously very happy too, “Well, daddy said before that if mommy wins an award, the acceptance speech has to be shared.”</p>
<p>Qi Hang suddenly breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed that Yu Yaoyao had prepared in advance, which was great.</p>
<p>“Great! Xiao Rui, could you share it with us?”</p>
<p>Little Bun agreed immediately.. He even cleared his throat through the microphone. In the next second, a serious and immature voice could be heard on the scene and in the live broadcast room.</p>
<p>“On behalf of my mommy, thank you everyone. Thank you uncles and aunties, thank you cctv, thank you to all the make-up aunties, uncle lighting, props… and thank you Uncle Ni Yi… My mommy is the best~”</p>
<p>“In the future, if you have any project that needs me to play as my mommy’s son, please do contact me~ Acting as a son, I could totally do it. I am so used to it, and I can make it natural and vivid. I’ll cooperate with the uncle director’s request. I can cry whenever I’m asked to.</p>
<p>“Well, if uncles and aunties think I’m fit for the role, please call Uncle Ni Yi’s number~139… I’ll repeat it again. Everyone can write that down, 139…”</p>
<p>The audience stopped for half a minute before bursting into laughter.</p>
