            <p><strong>Chapter 363</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao just happened to find the hot search about Ling Shuang’s weight gain while she was at home scrolling on her phone.</p>
<p>She clicked on the article that displayed a photo taken by reporters of Ling Shuang’s round, pudgy face. In the photo, Ling Shuang looked dispirited, the shell of the human she had once been.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was very shocked. How could she have gained this much weight in just a few days?</p>
<p>All the netizens in the comment area shared the same sentiment as Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>‘Is she overeating because she’s given up on herself? I knew she wasn’t a good person, but now she has lost her beauty! The inside matches the outside. I wonder if the fans that were defending her left the fandom! This picture really is shocking! She’s even fatter than me! No wonder the cast kicked her out. I mean, I wouldn’t even want this fat woman to be my girlfriend. This poor, overweight, ugly girl,” Yu Yaoyao thought to herself.</p>
<p>With shock written all over her face, Yu Yaoyao turned to Shen Yichong to show him the photo. “Darling… She has changed so much.”</p>
<p>This was crazier than those ridiculous plots in the novel. The exposed truth of her tricks must have hit her hard.</p>
<p>Just how much did she eat! How can a person become so fat in just a few days?</p>
<p>But her expression suddenly changed halfway through her train of thought, suddenly becoming tearful.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong casually finished scrolling through the hot search. His expression darkened the moment he read Ling Shuang’s name. Thanks to her calling him ‘big brother’ for no reason, he was now being tortured by his wife and son. He’d even had to write a 400-word self-reflection essay…</p>
<p>Originally, he had only instructed the directors to ban Ling Shuang. But after he’d finished writing the essay he’d decided to talk to several more directors and investors to cut her scenes in the films she’d starred in. He’d also told Chen Jiao to make her disappear from the city as fast as possible, warning him that he never wanted to see her again.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what happens to her,” Shen Yichong said as he returned the phone to Yu Yaoyao. He didn’t want to look at the article anymore.</p>
<p>But he was shocked to see Yu Yaoyao was sobbing. His couldn’t hide his surprise as he said, “What’s wrong? Don’t you hate her?”</p>
<p>He thought Yu Yaoyao would be happy.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao nodded pitifully, but then quickly shook her head. She reached out and tugged on Shen Yichong’s sleeves with her small hands. Her face had traces of fear and a faint blush as she looked up at him. “I’m sorry, Darling,” she said in a soft voice.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong raised his eyebrows, “Huh?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t listen to you and Xiao Yiyi before when I was overeating.” Yu Yaoyao lowered her face as she spoke, as if she was ashamed.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth opened and closed. He decided to stay silent.</p>
<p>As expected, she kept talking when he didn’t interrupt her. “You two warned me that I would get fat if I kept eating too much. I never believed you. I thought that a thin person couldn’t get fat, but…” Yu Yaoyao looked at her phone screen in horror as she said this. “It turns out that even a thin person can get as round as a ball!”</p>
<p>Ling Shuang had lost her originally pretty V-shaped face, and the only thing she could fit into was a pair of sports pants. One of her arms was thicker than Yu Yaoyao’s thigh now.</p>
<p>This terrified Yu Yaoyao!</p>
<p>“If I’m going to get this fat, then I won’t eat…. Any strawberry flavored pudding!” She struggled to pick which of her favorite treats she wanted to give up. After that slight hesitation, she finally decided on the strawberry flavor.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong laughed when he heard what she said. He took her slender, fair arm and studied it carefully. He could hold her upper arm in one hand. There wasn’t a single trace of fat on it. “You are not fat. Because you exercise every day, you burn off a lot of energy and calories.”</p>
<p>Even though she was still worried, Yu Yaoyao gave a serious nod. “I’m going to add an extra 30 minutes of running to my exercise plan.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, don’t worry so much. You only gained 20 pounds when you were pregnant with Shen Rui.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s entire face transformed into a look of utter shock and horror. Hesitantly she asked, “And when was he born?”</p>
<p>“You lost most of the weight. There were only about six pounds left.”</p>
<p>“What!” All that weight was still on her body! This was the first time she’d actually thought about this problem. “Darling, I suddenly feel like it’s a better idea not to have too many kids. Forget about the idea of giving birth to a football team. I think we’ll just have like, two or three kids.”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Shen Yichong smiled, but he could feel a headache pounding behind his eyes.</p>
<p>He’d become a very troubled father recently. Shen Rui had only started becoming more and more ridiculous. A football team meant 11 kids like Shen Rui… It felt like his head was going to explode just thinking about it.</p>
<p>But finally, his wife’s strange ideas about children were gone. Wonderful!</p>
<p>“Why don’t we have a look at some other news?” he asked, changing the topic.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao readily scrolled down to other news. And just like that, her attention was diverted from the topic of Ling Shuang.</p>
<p>“Darling, do you remember the movie, ‘Allure’?  The one that bankrupted you and withdrew your investment? The shooting is over, it’s entering the post-production phase. They have found some of the best special effects companies in the United States to work on it. They seem awfully confident in this,” she said with a click of her tongue. “Oh, freaking gangster Chen is playing as the third lead actor. He almost put in an additional investment to fill the gap in the cost of special effects for film production.”</p>
