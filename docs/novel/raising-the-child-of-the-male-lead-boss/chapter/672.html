            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 79 – A Terrifying Scream</strong></p>
<p>It is true that the content of her performance is totally inconsistent with her acting title!</p>
<p>He looked at the stage in tremendous fear, trembling, and he could barely wipe the sweat on his forehead anymore.</p>
<p>But as soon as he turned his head and glanced at the female contestant who was making a ruckus and mocking her, suddenly, a loud scream came from the stage, scaring him so much that he almost bit his tongue!</p>
<p>It was a heart-wrenching scream tore out from the bottom of her lungs!</p>
<p>Almost instantly, it made the hair on his body rise in goose bumps, his scalp going numb.</p>
<p>When he looked at the stage this time, a change had already happened. He didn’t know when Yu Yaoyao, who had just been lying in bed and narcissistically looking in the mirror, sit up. She was also covering her left face, black hair passing through her slender fingers. As she buried her face in her hands, and she let out a terrible scream!</p>
<p>No one had an idea what she saw in the mirror. But everyone knew, that it must have been something terrible for her to be like this! There was pure panic in her eyes, and despite the distance, her horrible cry was directly heard by all the audience.</p>
<p>She sat hunchbacked, the hand holding the mirror starting to shake. She gasped lowly, almost breathlessly, like a voice of fear coming from her throat. She looked at the mirror as if she was looking at a stranger, no, a dreadful devil!</p>
<p><em><strong>I don’t know where this devil came from!</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>A disgusting, ugly monster!</strong></em></p>
<p>The fingers of her left hand holding the mirror suddenly loosened slightly. Breathless, she slowly squinted at the mirror.</p>
<p>“AHH!” Another scream tore out as she threw the mirror away. Immediately, both of her hands trembled, covering her face. She moved slowly, every touch was cautious and precise. Her pair of once confident eyes now look crazed, her pupils dilated, and her focus scattered.</p>
<p>“No, no, no…no…”</p>
<p>As she shook her head violently, her black hair flew in all directions, becoming tangled with each other in disorder.</p>
<p>But no one still knew what she was talking about.</p>
<p>Her chest continued to fluctuate aggressively, painfully, as if she could not breathe. As if in an instant something had taken all her strength from her body and made her fall to the ground in despair.</p>
<p>As if she had lost her <em>soul</em>.</p>
<p>The long finger, touching the broken mirror on the ground, shrank back like it had been scalded. And a tear suddenly rolled down, seen from the only crack left behind uncovered by her inky hair. She slowly held her knees to her chest, looking helpless and fragile, and buried her side face tightly between her legs.</p>
<p>She suddenly shivered all over, as another hoarse cry came from out her throat. This time—it was for from being sharp and loud. It was almost like wail, a tragic voice mustered from the depths of her soul. The people who immediately heard it in the moment, felt like the atmosphere was shrouded by bitterness and depression.</p>
<p>Soon, the whole wide studio was left with her only audible, painful cries. One after another, it flowed throughout the silent studio, desperate and powerless.</p>
<p>No one can laugh at this moment. Even the female artists who were mocking and sneering, had their expressions turned stiff. Throughout the stage, everyone felt the mood was too heavy, that breathing was a feat. Even many of the spectators could not help but put down their lightsticks and signboards.</p>
<p>Many of the people’s discussions and whispers ceased.</p>
<p>Finally, the desperate woman, shaking in the middle of the stage, stood up barefoot on the ground. Just when everyone already felt uncomfortable, she stretched out her hand and pulled her hair back, revealing her smooth forehead and still lovely little face.</p>
<p>Her whole person changed, and she threw a glamorous gaze under the stage.</p>
<p>“My performance is over. Thank you all.”</p>
<p><em>Where was the slightest disfigurement–there was no blemish in her beautiful face!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, the people in the studio finally relaxed, breathing a sigh one after another. But no one spoke for a long time. Before, despite if a person was performing in front, many fans of different contestants only whispered between themselves.</p>
<p>Now, however, the scene was so quiet that one can hear the sound of a pin drop.</p>
<p>Director Zhou Qiu of the judging panel laughed bitterly. After half a moment’s hesitation, he finally picked up the microphone in front of him.</p>
<p>“I also need a moment to calm down.”</p>
<p>Ni Yi’s heart was beating erratically. And his hands clenched to fists on his sides couldn’t stop shaking. He didn’t know what evil had happened and he couldn’t stop his trembling body.</p>
