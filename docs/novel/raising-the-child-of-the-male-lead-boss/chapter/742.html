            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 9 – She Wants This Little Child (3)</strong></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s hand immediately retracted. And the little bun lying gently on her stomach, like a frightened kitten, straightened up his head, looking towards the door.</p>
<p>It was Shen Yichong who opened the door. He was wearing a long, black windbreaker on top of his straight suit and he squinted at the little bun with some displeasure.</p>
<p>“Shen Rui, go to bed. You’ll go to kindergarten tomorrow.” Shen Yichong’s voice was low, but he still made sure that the little bun could hear clearly.</p>
<p>The little bun immediately looked back at Yu Yaoyao in a panic and then stared at his father in disapproval. He had a look as if he had been robbed of something he loves!</p>
<p>“Shen Rui, don’t let me say it again. Are you a man, not keeping your promise? You just said you’d come to see your mother and go to bed.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing now?” Shen Yichong finished.</p>
<p>When he said the second sentence, the little bun climbed out of bed, away from his mother’s stomach and stood stubbornly on the ground.</p>
<p>But the next second, he instantly turned fifteen degrees and pointed his butt at his father.</p>
<p>He stood there on a corner, his dark eyes shining with grievances, petty indignation, and embarrassment.</p>
<p><i>Obviously, if Dad hadn’t come in, he could have stayed in his mother’s arms a little longer. ~</i></p>
<p><i>Mom’s embrace— soft, different from Dad’s! But now it’s all blocked by Dad! As soon as Dad comes in and talks, Mom will be woken up. And when his mother wakes up, he can’t stay in her arms any longer.</i></p>
<p>He pursed his small mouth angrily.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong sighed and walked up to him. “Come to Dad and let your mother rest.”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Shen Yichong grabbed his son and used a small towel to dry his teary face. However, the little stuffed bun struggled restlessly. When it was tucked into its own small bed, it protested discontentedly and kicked off the quilt covered over him.</p>
<p>His pair of small, black eyes stared at Yu Yaoyao without blinking. This unwilling look would almost make people think that they were far away from each other and not inside a ward.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong couldn’t help but frown further, squatting down in front of his son. “Shen Rui, there are some problems between father and mother, and we may not be able to continue living together in the future.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who pretended to be sleeping, had been eavesdropping with her ears perked up and eyes squinting. But when she heard this, she couldn’t hold it anymore and wanted to wake up, but she was shocked by Shen Yichong’s next sentence.</p>
<p>“Dad doesn’t want to deceive you. You are big now, you’ve learned to watch the news yourself.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was shocked. She glanced at the bed and sure enough, there was a mini-tablet placed to the side. The next second it was firmly held by the little bun within his arms.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was squatting with his back to her. “You saw it too, didn’t you? Father and mother are not happy together.”</p>
<p>The little stuffed bun’s small head suddenly tilted down, leaving only the eyelashes that were naturally curled to be seen trembling.</p>
<p>“Shen Rui, live with your father and set your mother free.”</p>
<p>“You also want your mother to be happy, right?”</p>
<p>The little stuffed bun sobbed, his thin shoulders shaking so much, and he was trying to refrain from crying out loud. For a very long time, he was reluctant, but then he nodded his little head sadly.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao’s peeping eyes were hot, and she immediately held the tears at bay. She opened her mouth wide, raising her hand weakly from the bed.</p>
<p>“About that, wait…I am very happy now!”</p>
