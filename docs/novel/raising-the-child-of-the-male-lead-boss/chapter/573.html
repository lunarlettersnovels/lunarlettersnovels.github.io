            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 182 – Peculiar People (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Director Zhao, I think this is not good. If we wait for two hours, it is still 9 o’clock in the evening. Come 11 PM, what do the young couples do when they return to the room… How do I film such private matters?” Lao Zheng said.</p>
<p>“You are all experienced people. Lao Zheng you also have two children, that’s why you understand matters like this, right? We can still do things like this, can we?”</p>
<p>Lao Zheng shook his head in protest.</p>
<p>“You don’t prevent people from having a second child. Why not try putting yourself in the shoes of President Shen, would you like it if a director as obsessed as you films every moment of them like a stalker?”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu took a sip of his wine and almost choked at the other’s words. He gave Lao Zheng a deadly stare.</p>
<p>“I… I am dedicated to my profession. Go! No further discussion needed! Even if it is the plot of having a second child, you have to film everything for me!”</p>
<p>Lao Zheng looked at him, sighed deeply, and shook his head.</p>
<p><em>The director is crazy!</em></p>
<p>Zhao Yu was miffed. All he wanted to do was film the trio eating together, flashing a very passionate smile to each other. He also wanted to showcase Shen Yichong being a slave to his wife.</p>
<p><em>Wait!</em> He stared blankly in the air. Has he unconsciously become a fan of Yu Yaoyao and her family? Could it be that he unknowingly became fond of her too?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, his behaviour right now seemed to be of no difference from that of a stalker!</p>
<p>Zhao Yu swallowed a non-existent lump in his throat.</p>
<p>“I am not! I am not dedicated to my profession!” He reassured himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>In a nameless suburban seafood buffet restaurant, Yu Yaoyao was personally supervising the whole process of her big lobster being poached by the chef. This place was actually not all that big. It only had one floor and seemed to be spread in an area of less than a hundred square meters. The tables and chairs were only a few, amounting only to six and the  interiors particularly had a classic medieval style.</p>
<p>In the entire restaurant, there were only three customers. A family.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was sitting at the table next to the window with candles lit. Shen Rui’s high-chair was placed on his left side. Yu Yaoyao sat opposite him.</p>
<p>At the moment, both the big and small seats were empty, and from his seat, Shen Yichong could see the mother and the child, almost harassing the chef to the point of him almost falling down.</p>
<p>“Come back here! Don’t interfere with the chef’s cooking. He will make sure to cook delicious lobsters for us.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong furrowed his brow at the sight of his wife and son. But obviously, Yu Yaoyao did not listen to her husband and stayed there.</p>
<p>“Isn’t the kitchen open for us to see how he cooks the lobsters? Husband, I just want to see how delicious lobsters are made so I can cook it for you at home in the future… if Ms. Zhang is not around, you will only cook noodles for us. My baby and I are getting tired of eating it~”</p>
<p>The little bun standing beside his mother was hesitant to nod. He thought that his father’s cooking was delicious, it tasted so good that he could even eat two small bowls of it. But he… also wanted to try to eat his Mommy’s cooking. He had never tried it before.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s mouth twitched. He got up, directly walked towards the kitchen area, and caught Yu Yaoyao’s fingers poking the lobster.</p>
<p>“Don’t move!”</p>
<p>The lobster that Yu Yaoyao was poking had sharp claws that were even more developed than smaller ones. If one were pinched with a lobster’s claws, it would truly be an experience of pain!  Even skilled chefs were very careful when handling them.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao was particularly reluctant to give up. “Husband, I want to watch the shrimp pee…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong’s expression was utterly out of the ordinary. He didn’t even know how this woman’s brain cells became so strange after her hospitalization. And it happened that there was a little fellow in the family who eagerly reciprocated to his mother’s unusual mentality.</p>
<p>“I also want to see it, Dad! I’ve never seen shrimp pee before… I’ve only seen Daddy do it…”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong bent down, directly picked up his son, and successfully stopped him from further saying something atypical. But even so, he couldn’t stop Yu Yaoyao from curiously looking at him in that area. His temples were throbbing, and the blood in his veins was circulating twice as fast as he could imagine.</p>
<p>“Go back… sit down. Okay?!”</p>
<p>He felt that he was losing his mind. Yu Yaoyao puckered her mouth and regretfully turned back to the seat.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after sitting down, she stopped thinking about the lobster being cooked. But it didn’t take too long for her other interest to rise again.</p>
<p>Human beings are too fastidious about cooking. She used to eat directly when she was in the wild or in the zoo. There was no cooking, seasonings, spices, condiments… Humans were too meticulous with their food.<em> Life as a snake is so easy!</em></p>
<p>Soon, she smiled happily and tugged the man’s sleeves. “Husband I have seen it on the TV in the restaurant. The host in ‘Gourmet Food’ merely ate a lot of lobsters. And after listening to the chef, he asked his viewers for money…”</p>
<p>“Husband, you can make money by just eating a lot of food! I too want to participate in this live duck eating show~” Yu Yaoyao said, her saliva trickled down.</p>
<p>She didn’t know that there was such a job—a job where people earned a lot of money by eating a lot of delicious food. It was such a cost-effective job!</p>
<p>Shen Yichong: “…”</p>
<p>He then picked up the napkin and wiped her small mouth directly. “Shen Rui, help your mother wipe it.”</p>
