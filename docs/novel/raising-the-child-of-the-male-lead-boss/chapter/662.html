            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 89 – The Little Flower’s Tricks (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Even after picking up yang and nourishing yin, the boss still has a nosebleed… yeah, his anger is still too strong! </em></p>
<p>Ni Yi lamented quietly while Yu Yaoyao ate the last mouthful of steamed buns with eagerness and said her goodbyes to Shen Rui reluctantly.</p>
<p>After getting on the nanny van, Ni Yi endured his curiosity and refrained from asking about the couple. He explained their upcoming work first.</p>
<p>“Elder sister, I sent a recipe to mama Xu…you can’t eat steamed buns in the morning. It’s high in sugar and can easily make you fat.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was sitting in the back seat of the car. Her delicate eyebrows were lifted, as she silently tucked her rose-colored Prada bag behind her. Inside were three little puddings that had been hidden. Before she left, she had secretly asked mama Xu for them.</p>
<p>One for every day!</p>
<p>“Elder sister, bear with it for now. Let’s focus on looking good at the program; there are bound to be many rapid announcements.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh.” Yu Yaoyao nodded quietly with an angelic face.</p>
<p>Today’s schedule is a live performance assessment, and acting topics were supposed to be drawn by lots. However, early in the morning when they entered the set, the director had announced that method for selecting the performance topic was to be the same as before.</p>
<p>That is, according to ranking, and thus, choosing in reverse order.</p>
<p>When this was said, almost everyone looked at Meng Xinran with angry eyes, except for her small group of six friends.</p>
<p>In the previous stage, nearly 80% of the 20 people who were eliminated were back-row players. Now, the back-row players all feel that Meng Xinran’s suggestion has placed heavy pressure on them. Meanwhile, the front row players, who lost the right to choose props first, are also facing the dilemma of their positions being reshuffled and are regretting it.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s face still looked sweet on the outside, but her heart was almost vomiting blood.</p>
<p>“Sister Yu, I’m sorry. Because of our hot-headedness, we hastily agreed to the proposal of reversing the order.”</p>
<p>“Some people really thought it out to make you lose the first-place advantage.”</p>
<p>Those at the bottom and even some from the middle-row players all showed their kindness to Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>Of course, this was not because she reminded them with her words that this was a competition. It was because of her husband’s background, the continuous affection of her sponsors and even the attention of the program directing team on her. These were enough to make these young newcomers throw the little flower Meng Xinran aside, and gather around Yu Yaoyao who had a better background, in an instant.</p>
<p>Meng Xinran teeth itched. She never dreamed the day would come it would be <em>her</em>, not this ignorant lady, who would be isolated.</p>
<p>Her eyes glanced at the scene as her best friend beside her smiled at her reassuringly. “Don’t fret, everything is ready.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran’s face suddenly looked lighter. And Yu Yaoyao, who was surrounded by everyone who wanted to chat with her, also felt a sense of an incoming catastrophe. Following her intuition, she soon saw Meng Xinran looking at her with a harmless smile.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao eyebrows pricked up a little as she rubbed the gooseflesh on her arm. <em>This little flower must be playing tricks again!</em></p>
<p>“Sister Yu, what would you like to choose later?” The girl at the bottom of the list said, affectionately holding her arm, “We will all keep it for you.”</p>
<p>Although she looked kind and warm, her eyes were a different story.</p>
<p>“Yes, we’ll keep it for you!”</p>
<p>“Yes! I don’t want to rob sister Yu of her rightful place. ”</p>
<p>Soon, her ears were filled with friendly words, as the contestants tried hard to curry favor with her. Still, Yu Yaoyao’s heart moved. She looked at the topics given by the program group:</p>
<p>《Road beggar》</p>
<p>《Lottery winner》</p>
<p>《Cheating madam》</p>
<p>《Barber》</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>Each topic could be chosen five times. And after all slots were gone, the remaining contestants need to select from the other topics afterward.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao browses through it again and finally grinned, looking satisfied.</p>
<p>“I want to be a beggar,” she simply said.</p>
<p>As soon as she spoke her topic, everyone was stunned.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao, who stood in the corner with her own light, was impossible to be linked with beggars. But the smile on her lips became even stronger.</p>
