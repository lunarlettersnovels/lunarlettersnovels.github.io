            <p><strong>Chapter 246 – Another Little Bun (1)</strong></p>
<p>Director Zhou Qiu looked at the monito, admiring the scene. He could watch it all day. The approval in his eyes couldn’t be wiped away. The deviation from the script had worried him a bit, but the impromptu play put on by the actresses were quite good.</p>
<p>Thinking it a part of the scene, the director didn’t even notice Gu Qianqian still holding her hand on the ground. “Qianqian, the way you fell on the ground was wonderful. Good job!” he commented.</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian’s elegant face distorted into a grimace, “Director Zhou, my hand seems to be injured…”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu suddenly frowned and looked at the person from the crew standing next to him. “Is the medical staff present?” he asked. Gu Qianqian seemed to relax a little.</p>
<p>“Send someone down and have them check on Little Yu,” Director Zhou said immediately, pointing towards the window from where Yu Yaoyao had fallen for the act. Gu Qianqian’s mouth twitched, and ugly contempt shrouded her eyes. The reporters weren’t blind to this. They could clearly gauge that there was some tension between the female lead and the side actress.</p>
<p>One of the reporters snatched the chance to ask, “Ms. Gu, are you injured? Did sister Yu push you too hard?” Another one added, “Was the slap and the shove not in the script? Ms. Gu, were you caught unprepared because of it?” Gu Qianqian was irritated, she knew where this was going. The reporters would dig out the smallest of incidents and make a mountain out of a molehill. They would question her experience and professionalism.</p>
<p>Thankfully Director Zhou hated tabloids, gossip, and paparazzi. He hated the scandals even more. He was aware how yesterday’s scandal had almost ruined Yu Yaoyao, an aspiring, talented actress. He had allowed reporters and paparazzi in today to clarify everything so they wouldn’t spread false rumors.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu was glowering. He had his furious eyes directed towards the reporters and thundered, “Gu Qianqian wasn’t supposed to respond to Yu Yaoyao’s shove. The actresses improvised based on their understanding of the characters. I, as the director, felt that there was nothing wrong with the scene. Both the actresses have showcased their talents and added something unique to the scene. Do you presume to know more about filming and acting than a professional director and actresses present here on the set?”</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu added, “You are allowed to have your opinions but do not twist the reality to besmirch the actresses and their hard work. I will allow the reporters to attend one more shooting where you can clarify any questions you have. The crew is going to wrap the scene up, please leave for now.”</p>
<p>The reporters weren’t intimidated. They smelled out new headlines that could bring out new gossip: <strong>“Gu Qianqian went beyond the script and slapped Yu Yaoyao?”</strong></p>
<p>They would blow up the incident. Since the director had admitted that there was a deviation from the script, the simple impromptu act would be blown out of proportions. The headlines and articles would exaggerate everything. Gu Qianqian could see the headlines in her mind, “<em>Gu Qianqian hit Yu Yaoyao because she hates the side actress.” </em>Sigh.</p>
<p>Zhou Qiu anxiously turned to Gu Qianqian, “Why are you still on the ground? Go and let a medical staff see to your hand. You will catch a cold sitting on the cold ground.” He turned and left the set, shaking his head.</p>
<p>It was clear that the director treated the two actresses differently. He favored Yu Yaoyao more than Gu Qianqian. As an assistant helped Gu Qianqian off the floor, her face was still bitter. The reporters wanted to dig more, but thankfully, they left her alone. The reporters wanted more stories on Yu Yaoyao, as she was the rising talent. So, they left one after the other. Some asked for an interview from Gu Qianqian at a later date, but followed the others to the first floor, where Yu Yaoyao supposedly was.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>Shen Yichong with Little Rui were the first to reach Yu Yaoyao. He held her in his arms, while checking for any injuries on her, while Little Bun babbled anxiously, holding his mother’s hands. Shen Yichong was familiar with tabloid reporters and paparazzi, and he hated nothing more in the world than them. Nobody expected him to be the first person to rush down to Yu Yaoyao, but there he was, with her in his arms, glowering at the approaching reporters. His glare was so intense that only a few of the reporters dared to inch closer.</p>
<p>“Oh my god! It was so scary, I thought I would just die. The fall was just too high. I am still shaking,” Yu Yaoyao sobbed in Shen Yichong’s arms. The reporters were stunned. The cold, indifferent character that Yu Yaoyao had portrayed before was gone. She was now a trembling mess of softness in her husband’s arms. Shen Rui also cried with his mother, holding her hand. “Mommy, please don’t cry,” he said, hiccuping through his own tears.</p>
<p>“What happened to sister Yaoyao? Is she hurt from the fall?” asked a voice from behind the crowd. It was Gu Qianqian. Every eye was on her. She had her right hand hanging at her side limply, her face pale. “Shall we go to the hospital together?”</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian just wanted to make trouble. She wanted to make Yaoyao apologize. All the people turned to Yu Yaoyao for her answer but were met with Shen Yichong’s cold, dark glare. He spoke in an icy tone, “Chen Lin, take Ms. Gu to the hospital for a check-up. Once you get the results, send me a copy so I know everything is alright.”</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian looked like she had swallowed sand, she squeezed out a pained smile, “How can I trouble you? It’s perfectly alright! I can go by myself. Take care of Yu Yaoyao.”</p>
<p>Gu Qianqian dare not let anyone accompany her. The medical reports would prove that she was just creating a fuss over a pain that wasn’t there. Gu Qianqian wanted to add more words to soothe the situation but was interrupted by a soft cry from the safety mat.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao raised her pale face up to look at her husband. She put a hand on her stomach, “The little bun in my stomach…”</p>
<p>All hell broke loose. The reporters caught on some new information to add to the already convoluted situation.</p>
