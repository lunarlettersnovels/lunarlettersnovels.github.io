            <p><strong>Chapter 237 – Suffering An Injustice (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Livyuna</em></p>
<p><em>Editor: Lunarise</em></p>
<p><em>Proofreader: Livyuna</em></p>
<p><em>Eyes like diamonds? What? </em>Ni Yi wanted to grapple director Ji Chang’s head, and jostle it a bit to see if there was anything wrong. What kind of bloody script was this?</p>
<p>He had only heard of tiny little stars making an appearance, vividly flashing; like the illuminating clarity of a flawless diamond; a product of something so repressive, yet the fieriness reigning supreme.</p>
<p>But this, it was a different kind of bullshit.</p>
<p>“Director, this doesn’t seem to describe the eyes of a human. Are you sure you’re not referring to some fancy prosthetic eyes?!”</p>
<p>He has heard of good teeth — pearly-whites in all its glory, but never of diamond-like eyeballs!</p>
<p>Ni Yi couldn’t hold it back; the thought was persistent. It had been rising up like bile in his throat for a few minutes now, threatening to be let out. In the end, he chose to give in and speak up.</p>
<p>The top diamond is sharp and unblemished, not a trace of impurity can be found. It is completely clear, shining the brightest, like a lone jewel amongst dull gravel.</p>
<p>He was not man who knew much, but at the very least he was knowledgeable about optical theory: when light refracts on a diamond, it would produce a colorful luster!</p>
<p>“Which one of you shall demonstrate this?” Ni Yi spat, a frown evident in his brow.</p>
<p>Director Ji Chang looked displeased. “We are shooting a commercial to showcase the finest of diamonds, not a cheap, common snack like last time! I’m only asking you to act as best as you can in front of the camera. , is that so difficult to do?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi squinted, turning to look at Jia Zijie seriously. “If this will be the case, then we can’t film and fulfill your product requirements, Mr. Jia. You can gladly look for others who can!”</p>
<p>If it were several years back, Jia Zijie would’ve admired Yu Yaoyao’s timeless beauty; a face that exceeded the restraints of standards. But now, only trails of mockery overflowed from his mouth, seeping out the corners. Still, he kept a cautious front. Pretention was second nature in the industry, after all.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, what did you say? Our request only reflects that of our company’s quality. Although we are only a sub-brand, it is important to insist that every diamond produced will come out exquisite, pure, and bright—to deeply root in the hearts of our people.”</p>
<p>He then turned to Yu Yaoyao with a scowl. “I think your demand is very suitable for our position. If the brand ambassador for this ad fails to deliver, then we absolutely have no choice but to replace them!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was struck with provocation, and grinned quite unconsciously. Her face looked like  spring breeze under that light; lively and refreshing, eyes unusually bright.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll try it. It’d cost nothing. Little Yi, move over to the side. You are blocking the director’s lens!” She turned her head and winked at Ni Yi.</p>
<p>Ni Yi twitched at the action, but nodded all the same. He glanced at both the director and the producer, bowing his head in respect, and quickly went to the corner. He held the phone tightly without uttering a single word. Jia Zijie spared a glance at the man’s frustration, taking notice of the coldness bubbling inside himself.</p>
<p>He dared to challenge him just now!</p>
<p>“All right, let’s go!”</p>
<p>Director Ji Chang commanded, and with a wave of his hand, there emerged Liu Shashan, a tall and slender model, walking to the camera. She is to play a wealthy girl and the resemblance was undeniable.</p>
<p>She stood at 1.75 meters tall with excellent body proportions, as is befitting for the role. Her dark, v-neck dress hugged the sinuous curves of her figure, contrasting against the flaming red that adorned her lips. Liu Shashan wore a set of heavy, gold bracelets on her wrists. On her ample bosoms, sat a vibrant string of tourmaline beads, and accentuating her frame were high-heels, studded with large, glimmering diamonds enough to rival that of the city skyline.</p>
<p>The vigorous aroma of tyranny was overwhelming. And so, after Liu Shashan sauntered out of the stage, settling to stand in front of the camera, her very distinct, but ultimately inviting aura, stretched all over the place.</p>
<p>The high-end model’s face also served a vast difference from more quotidian celebrities. The red dress that draped her body, coupled with the sparkle of incandescent jewelry grasping refined skin, were worn with such a sense of luxury only belonging to that of upper-class women.</p>
<p>Upon her reverberating entrance, small groups of actors by the corner quickly hurried to stand up; staring in both awe and envy at the beauty that is Liu Shashan.</p>
<p>Director Ji Chang smiled triumphantly. He thought the scene before him to be eye-catching.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yu Yaoyao, who was contrastingly dressed as a young sailor girl, couldn’t help but dim a little, closing in on herself. After all, her character was supposed to portray a charming goddess, pure of innocence and far from having a coquettish appeal. Even if the makeup and wardrobe adorning both models were almost similar, it still hid more than half of Yu Yaoyao’s natural charm.</p>
<p>Compared to the extravagance of Liu Shashan, she may not have enough.</p>
<p>“Yu Yaoyao, you will come over here!” Director Ji Chang’s commanding voice booms loudly across the stage, his finger pointed at a fixed point in the set. Both the reflectors and camera tracks were ready.</p>
<p>“Action!”</p>
<p>Ji Chang and Jia Zijie stared intensely close at the scene playing out. The smiles on their faces grew thicker by the minute. They all felt an insidious satisfaction upon figuring out how to reprimand her incompetence.</p>
<p>However, the thought left as quickly as it came. Very soon, their mouths gradually stiffened into a thin, bitter line.</p>
