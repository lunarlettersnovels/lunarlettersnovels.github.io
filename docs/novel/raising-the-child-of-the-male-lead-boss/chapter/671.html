            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 80 – Brushing a Favorable Impression (1)</strong></p>
<p>Ni Yi soon found out that most of the people in the audience reacted as he did.</p>
<p>Finally, it was director Zhou Qiu who broke the silence. With a soft sigh, he started, “I used to tell actors that if they want to act sad scenes, they should never <em>act </em>them. Because pain, cannot be merely performed. When a person’s pain reaches the extreme, the despair then spreads to the people around. It doesn’t have to be wordy–even the most desperate look can already be heart-wrenching. Just a mournful cry should even be enough to stir the emotions of the people watching. Most of all, it should not be fake. Actor’s need to make the most of their body language to express immense sadness that it would reach the audience and become one with them.”</p>
<p>With his impassioned speech, Director Zhou Qiu then spread his hand to Yu Yaoyao on the stage, a hint of affirmation on his solemn face.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on doing it successfully.”</p>
<p>Shao Qing, an old but experienced actor, nodded his head and even showed the hint of a smile on his usually stiff face.</p>
<p>“Just now, the sense of repression in this whole room has evidently shown the success of this deduction. Today, I will vote for you… Furthermore, your first act admiring yourself in the mirror was also good—it truly showed a beautiful woman who was extremely satisfied with her appearance.”</p>
<p>This old actor’s words instantly brought the stunned audience around to sober up. They looked up the stage, their eyes burning the image of the woman on the stage.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao is standing in the center, barefoot and wearing a white dress. Her long hair draped to her slim waist, her clear orbs like water paired with slightly upward curved eyes. And her smile that was reminiscent of spring, made her like a fairy who had awaken in a quiet forest.</p>
<p>And illuminated under the beam of stage lights, it was as if, there was a hazy hallow covering her figure.</p>
<p>She is clearly a stunning woman with no trace of any defect in her appearance. Yet, it was this woman with a perfect face that was able to act out a tragic scene of disfigurement that stirred their hearts and emotions.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, applause rang out one by one in the once silent room, and then there were more and more that the room became deafening. There came even whistles and cheers from several men.</p>
<p>Standing under the stage, Ni Yi felt as if he had just done bungee jumping. His shirt inside was almost wet with sweat, and even the tip of his nose still had dew on them.</p>
<p>At one point, he thought he was going to die, but her performance, like a safety rope, instantly held him back stably from a terrible free-fall. And it even quickly let him bounce into the air again!</p>
<p>Ni Yi almost cried.</p>
<p>He turned his head and looked at the woman who had just mocked her sister then, who looked shocked at the moment. He couldn’t help but snort.</p>
<p>The female artist’s face suddenly turned white.</p>
<p>For the live voting, Yu Yaoyao won 453 votes! And the addition of two judges, with each of their votes equivalent to 500 votes, it totaled to 1453 votes!</p>
<p>“Miss Yu,” the host stepped onto the stage, “You won more votes than Meng Xinran, who is in the second place, and the third-place contestant, Dajian once again. Your comeback five years later makes us seem to see a brand new you. How did you do it?”</p>
<p>Ni Yi wiped his sweat excitedly. <em>Of course, it’s hard work!</em></p>
<p>Although his sister used to give out terrible performances, now…What a leap forward! It must have been a period of self-practice at home, and other acting lesson, practicing like hell.</p>
<p><em>Sister, you surely didn’t waste your days at home!</em></p>
<p>His eyes were red—he felt so lucky to be still able to continue working with his sister Yu. This time, he will watch his sister soar all the way in the entertainment circle!</p>
<p>A lot of words emerged in his mind, but unfortunately, the host did not direct the question to him at all. And this large issue, also caused some of the audience to boo.</p>
<p><em>This interview is boring!</em></p>
<p>There were a lot of Meng Xinran and Dajian’s fans sitting below. The host had pulled these two people back, which immediately highlighted Yu Yaoyao as a problem in their eyes–these fans could only feel the situation was unbearable.</p>
<p>The booing made the host embarrassed and the judges turned their heads to the audience. Meanwhile, the staff was also ready to intervene in an attempt to suppress the atmosphere of applause.</p>
<p>However, Yu Yaoyao unexpectedly took over the microphone.</p>
<p>“A new me? Well…it’s because of my husband’s <em>nourishment</em>.” As she spoke, she conjured up a seductive smile with her full red lips.</p>
