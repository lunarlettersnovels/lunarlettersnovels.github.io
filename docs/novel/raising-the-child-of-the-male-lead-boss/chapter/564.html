<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 193 – Actress Turned Love Guru (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: SM</em><br>
<em>Editor: Larkspur</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao thought that his situation was even worse than hers. Although she didn’t understand that feeling before, she could still think about Shen Yichong’s warm embrace… When she thought about it, her heart beat very fast!</p>
<p>“I haven’t been in love with anyone, being in a relationship might be very difficult. I’m not used to it.” Yu Yaoyao suddenly felt that she had found a member for her<em> ‘don’t know what love is’ </em>clique.</p>
<p>She immediately patted her chest and said, “I’ll help you! I promise you’ll soon understand what it’s meant to love.” She was not clever, but she was not stupid either. After saying so, she grabbed Yu Haiquan’s sleeve.</p>
<p>“Come with me, I’ll teach you how!”</p>
<p>Yu Haiquan: “…!”</p>
<p>After a few minutes, a dull Yu Haiquan almost subconsciously followed Yu Yaoyao to the other side of the set. He kept on staring at the script in his hand with a puzzled look. He still couldn’t believe he’d followed her.</p>
<p>Soon, Yu Yaoyao gave him a pen and got down on her special couch with a satisfied smile on her face. Ni Yi followed her as he didn’t feel at ease over Yu Yaoyao’s whereabouts. Funny enough, he was carrying a thermos in this distressing situation. Zhou Lin saw them come back and immediately announced the continuation of the filming.</p>
<p>They were about to film the scene where they were stuck: after Emperor Zhou Huang saved her, he was immediately attracted to her beauty behind the veil. But soon, she was taken away by her maidservant and he couldn’t do anything but just watch her leave. Not long after, he stopped her, took off the jade pendant on his waist, and gave it to her.</p>
<p>Yu Haiquan was still a bit wary, but when he heard the clapper, he had completely transformed from his previous state of abstraction. The most important part of this performance was finding the core emotions, not only the emotion of someone expressing love at first sight, but also the emperor’s possessiveness when seeing his woman!</p>
<p>“Good!” Zhou Lin couldn’t hold himself and shouted. “Yu Haiquan, you acted well this time! I was worried that you wouldn’t be able to play an emperor, but now your eyes are wholly expressing the right emotions, which is different from before!”</p>
<p>His voice brought Yu Haiquan back to his senses, he looked like he had been too immersed in his acting to even notice it was done… Even the praise he received was a little unbelievable.</p>
<p>“Director Zhou…”</p>
<p>“Keep it up!” Zhou Lin happily gave him a thumbs up.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao walked over and raised her hand with a smile. Yu Haiquan froze but immediately gave her a high five. Furthermore, his expression right now was more respectful. “Thank you very much, Elder Sister!”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao waved her hand, “It’s nothing ~” But halfway through, she stopped and asked, “My assistant said that your dad owns a chain of high-end restaurants. Is the food there delicious? Do you sell meat? Do you need taste-testers?”</p>
<p>Yu Haiquan: “… ”</p>
<p>Ni Yi: “…”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>In every subsequent scene after that, Yu Yaoyao and Yu Haiquan smoothly finished every scene. They cooperated well with each other and were able to portray the right emotions.</p>
<p>While she was filming, the crew of ‘My Wife and I’ arrived. An idle photographer went to the smoking-room for a fag. “Lao Zheng, do you really want to continue recording here? There’s nothing in here. We might not be able to capture the couple moments here. According to Ni Yi, President Shen is in a meeting with the shareholders of the company and has no time to interact with his wife.”</p>
<p>“Hey, it seems that news about the company’s financial crisis is true. But don’t worry, isn’t there a rumor that President Shen wants to take this opportunity to make his wife angry and then surprisingly restore the company’s market value? Now that the financial crisis has become a big deal, President Shen will definitely not give up!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, maybe that’s the reason why he’s been busy these past few days. It’s better not to take a leave at this time, we might be able to capture some news…”</p>
<p>Several people talked about Guangxin Entertainment’s financial crises on social media, but it didn’t take long for their eyes to drift away from their phones. At a glance, they saw a tall, handsome man who appeared at the door of the filming studios.</p>
<p><em>For sure it’s not Shen Yichong! </em><em>But who else can it be?! </em></p>
<p>The photographers couldn’t believe he came! They glanced at one another, quite happy about the situation. <em>Was he relying on variety shows to enhance the crumbling reputation of his wife and Guangxin?</em></p>
<p>Behind Shen Yichong, was his assistant Chen Lin, whose head was as big as a ball.</p>
<p>There were still many things that the boss needed to do first, but at six o’clock in the evening, Shen Yichong said it was time to eat. Chen Lin thought that he had to go to the restaurant to order the meal first but what he didn’t expect was for the boss to stand up directly and, without a word, head to the filming set.</p>
<p>Chen Lin was determined this time. He felt like his boss had returned to his twenties and fallen in love again. Earlier in the car, he peeked at him and saw Shen Yichong repeatedly reading piled-up comments by netizens on Weibo. He frowned slightly when he read the comments berating his wife.</p>
<p>Chen Lin sighed as he thought about that moment. Holding a stack of unfinished documents, and standing behind Shen Yichong with the laptop, he paused because the boss stopped. As they arrived, he heard Zhou Lin praising Yu Yaoyao and Yu Haiquan for their outstanding performance.</p>
<p>“Haiquan, you showed amazing expressions! In that scene you decided to take Yu Yaoyao into the palace, showing a bit of forbearance. However, the next moment, when you saw her go away, your forbearance turned into possessiveness, taking her to the palace immediately and acting like a hungry beast who was ready to undress her. You interpreted it very well, which really surprised me.” Zhou Lin said, praising the male artist.</p>
