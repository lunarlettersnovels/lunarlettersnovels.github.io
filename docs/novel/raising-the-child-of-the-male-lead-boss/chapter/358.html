            <p><strong>Chapter 405</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</strong></em></p>
<p>In terms of having the ability to make money, Shen Yichong seemed to be even better at it in than Yu Yaoyao. Afterall, it wouldn’t be wrong to say he was the head of the artists.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu honestly could never have expected Shen Yichong to do so well.</p>
<p>The helplessness he’d felt while recording ‘My Wife and I’ once again overtook him.</p>
<p>“154 now, Director. 164… 1964…”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu could do nothing but laugh bitterly.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong got so many Guangxin artists to show up in the broadcast, and the program group hadn’t had to pay them a cent.</p>
<p>No matter how he looked at it, it was a bargain for the program group.</p>
<p>Before the program had been officially broadcasted, the fans had begun to sympathize with and mock the program group in the comments in the live broadcast and on their new Weibo post:</p>
<p><em>[KO!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Director Zhao clearly didn’t learn his lesson from his previous experience. Hahaha!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Program Team: We don’t have a script. And even if we did, they wouldn’t use it!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I just want to remind everyone that our Yaoyao is still asleep! Now the destructive power of this family is only at half capacity.]</em></p>
<p>While everyone was busy joking around, Shen Yichong was already shopping for groceries with his son sitting on his shoulders. They were so alike, in both their styles and their attitudes.</p>
<p>People couldn’t help but laugh at the sight of the wife’s slave, and a mother’s slave together.</p>
<p>“Mommy wants to have steak for dinner. Daddy, buy the most expensive one you can find,” Little Bun said.</p>
<p>“Ok,” Shen Yichong replied patiently.</p>
<p>“Mommy likes chicken wings and chicken thighs. Daddy, buy them.”</p>
<p>“Ok.”</p>
<p>Little Bun even had a chat with the fishmonger. “Does this fish have a lot of meat? Does it have a lot of bones? My mommy doesn’t like fish with lots of bones. My mommy also likes to eat shrimps. Uncle, my mommy needs the finest shrimp!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t long until father and son had spent all the family funds.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao liked to eat meat, but she also needed to get enough fiber and protein in her diet. They also needed to buy rice and noodles.</p>
<p>They bought the best and most expensive brand for each ingredient, yet they were still worried that the food wouldn’t be to her liking.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong even bought a few different types of steak.</p>
<p>“This part is more tender. This is a little chewier. Sometimes, depending on her mood, she wants something a little chewier. But then again, she might also want something tender because she can get a little sensitive at times,” Shen Yichong explained to Zhao Yu.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu wiped the sweat off his head. “I know you have a lot of funds, but please don’t waste it.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong glanced at him. “We have two more guests, don’t we?”</p>
<p>Zhao Yu blinked at him silently.</p>
<p>Were the guests there to help clean up the leftovers?</p>
<p>The audience in the live broadcast room were nearly on the floor with laughter.</p>
<p>By the time Shen Yichong and Little Bun had finished spending all the money and returned home, Yu Yaoyao had woken up from her nap. Her hair was a little messier than it had been before she went to sleep, and her clothes were rumpled. She clutched at her stomach as she walked out the bedroom. When she saw her husband and son, she ran to them like a lamb that had lost its way.</p>
<p>“Darling, baby, where have you been? You were gone for such a long time!” she said as she opened her arms and hugged Shen Yichong’s waist.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong hugged her back. Little Bun, who was still sitting on his father’s shoulders, leaned over to give his mother a hug and a kiss on her cheek. “Mommy, we went out to buy something delicious!” Little Bun said, then promptly told her all about their shopping experience and what they had bought.</p>
<p>Some audience members in the live broadcast room suddenly noticed that Yu Yaoyao was wearing loose pajamas, which looked like they belonged to Shen Yichong, and she wasn’t wearing any makeup. It was obvious that the pajama shirt was a short sleeve, but on her it reached her forearms. Most importantly though, it fell comfortably past her waist and belly. Her cheeks were still flushed from her nap, and she looked to be in peak health. But she had cut her hair. It used to be waist-length and now only reached her shoulders. Not to mention it was also scraggly since she had just got up.</p>
<p><em>[I keep getting the feeling that something’s wrong with Yaoyao… Am I being too sensitive?]</em></p>
<p><em>[Is Yaoyao pregnant with a second baby? I cut my hair short too when I was pregnant back then. I also wore my husband’s clothes when I was home…]</em></p>
<p><em>[Did you guys also notice that her diet has changed? She used to like snacks so much. In ‘Wife’, Little Bun always brought her potato chips and pudding, but they didn’t buy snacks now when they went out shopping!]</em></p>
<p><em>[I think it’s impossible that she’s pregnant… Our Yaoyao just finished recording ‘Killer’ a while ago. I saw some pictures of her then; she had abs!]</em></p>
<p><em>[Right, didn’t Mr. Shen fall ill and go for a check-up last month? How can they have a baby so soon?]</em></p>
<p><em>[But I noticed the way Mr. Shen hugged Yaoyao. It was very different from ‘Wife’! He was more careful and gentler.]</em></p>
<p>The fans in the live broadcast room started a lively discussion.</p>
<p>But Yu Yaoyao no idea about any of this. She quickly rubbed her eyes and ate a washed cherry tomato that Little Bun held up to her.</p>
<p>Soon, the two other guests of the show arrived at the wooden house. They were a little confused when they saw Yu Yaoyao being treated like a queen. They had seen her being treated like this in the crew before, but they were surprised that she was being treated like this even when she was at home</p>
<p>“Xiao Yu, Mr. Shen, it’s been a long time since I last saw you.” The two guests were none other than the two main actors from ‘Year’: Wei Ming and Lu Cheng.</p>
<p>The first reason they joined the show was because the program group had invited them. The second reason was because they wanted to take advantage of it and promote the movie, ‘Year’, that was about to be released to premiere in September.</p>
<p>That, and they were also very close with Yu Yaoyao.</p>
<p>They hadn’t had much contact with Shen Yichong before. They only said hello to him while he was on the set with Yu Yaoyao. But now, they couldn’t help but laugh when they saw Shen Yichong wearing a pink apron and taking care of all the cooking.</p>
