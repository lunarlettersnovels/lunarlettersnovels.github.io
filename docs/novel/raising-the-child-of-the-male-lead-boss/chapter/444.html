<p><strong>Chapter 319 – Defeated (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Amy</em></p>
<p>“Closet? It was me, it was all me!” Zhao Mei cried, “It was not my daughter. Yes, yes, yes, it was me who asked for all the designer bags and jewelry that Shen Yichong bought for Yaoyao! I took everything from her wardrobe! I also took her bank card, and I changed the password. I took the money to go shopping and get beauty treatments!” she stopped to draw a breath before continuing, “Twenty million? Yes, correct. I am not satisfied with that small amount anymore. I used my identity as the stepmother to ask for money from Yu Yaoyao and Shen Yichong. If she refused, I would want a divorce. I was pregnant at that time, and I knew Shen Yichong would definitely agree to give me the money. I used it to buy a house and a car for my daughter. I also let her study abroad… My daughter didn’t know anything. She thought it was the funds from her father’s company. It was me all along!” the more Zhao Mei said, the crazier she sounded.</p>
<p>She had tried hard for most of her life. She had become Yu Jianghai’s mistress to get his money. And to drive his ex-wife away, she had even gotten pregnant before she was married to him. She had planned to use the child to firmly trap the rich man. But she had unexpectedly become the pain in his ass after his ex-wife had died.</p>
<p>When it came to his ex-wife, she had loved him and treated him well. The two of them had gotten together because of love. But with her, Zhao Mei, he was always guarded in fear that she would disappear with his money.</p>
<p>After she had married into the family with her child, only then did she realize that they would not get a cent after the marriage. They would only lead a life that seemed prosperous. From that day forth, she had frantically taught her daughter to hate and be jealous of Yu Yaoyao. She wanted her daughter to take away everything Yu Yaoyao had.</p>
<p>However, even after fighting her whole life, she could never defeat that woman. At least her daughter had got everything that Yu Yaoyao had. She thought she’d be able to take everything from the family.</p>
<p>But today…</p>
<p>With tears streaming down her face, Zhao Mei knelt on the ground in front of the reporter. Looking up, she could see her appearance reflected in the lens of the camera. She looked neither human nor ghost.</p>
<p>In the end, that woman’s daughter had still won.</p>
<p>Zhao Mei covered her face and cried loudly, “I, I apologize, dear reporters… I apologize now… Yu Yaoyao, I have never regarded you as my own daughter.  I’ve been lying to you all the time. I only wanted your money for my pension… I was wrong…”</p>
<p>In the end, the only thing she’d done was get old. She hadn’t gotten a cent from the money she’d worked all her life to get, married to an old man that she’d served from his eating to his dressing. He let her take the blame for his daughter. As for Zhao Mei’s biological daughter, even if she only existed because of the money back then, Zhao Mei had taken care of her all her life. And now her own daughter was letting her take all the blame for her.</p>
<p>Clearly all those years meant nothing. After Zhao Mei had given her best youthful years to this man with no conscience, and raised a trashy daughter, she had ended up with nothing. Even her wage was lower than the servants at home and now… Now she had to depend on her husband and daughter for her pension.</p>
<p>“I was wrong… really wrong… I was wrong from the beginning… The amount I owe you…. The beauty salon is now closed, the house is sold. Everything will be paid back to you. They’re not mine… They’re not mine after all…” Zhao Mei wept bitterly and ended up fainting on the ground.</p>
<p>At 8:30pm, the telephone interviews with several reporters ended. At nine o’clock in the evening, several media outlets released follow-up reports on the blood-sucking incident on various platforms. They also released the interview video.</p>
<p>Netizen everywhere were surprised.</p>
<p>Before, some people had thought that YY fans were too intense. They thought the fans might be biased and that they didn’t know or understand the truth. After hearing the recording, everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>This stepmother really had no bottom line!</p>
<p>On the other hand, YY fans were very satisfied. They wished they could celebrate their victory with the world. They took turns to go online every day, sent out apology requests regularly, pressed reporters for follow-up reports and urged relevant departments to investigate until finally, there was a return.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was feeding her son a chicken wing when she saw the video report. She left him, picked up her phone and walked to the balcony. Although the night was dark, there was a bright moon hanging in the sky that cast light over everything.</p>
<p>“Sister, I have achieved what I promised I would,” she said softly.</p>
<p>Her mistress stepmother might never be able to get her reputation back. Yu Yaoyao was sure she would be regretting her crimes for the rest of her life. There was also a lot of evidence that showed her toxic half-sister, Yu Xinjie, had taken her possessions. Yu Xinjie’s reputation was completely ruined as well.</p>
<p>Yu Jianghai’s betrayal in his marriage, and his silence when it came to his wife and youngest daughter extorting his eldest daughter, was also known by the public.</p>
<p>“Sister, you can now rest in peace. Next…” Yu Yaoyao narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>Only the original female lead, Ling Shuang, was left. In the story, Ling Shuang was the younger sister that Chen Jiao picked up. She and Yu Xinjie had almost become best friends. One would get Shen Yichong and the other would get Chen Jiao. At the end of the story, the two of them were sharing the spoils.</p>
<p>If it were said that Yu Xinjie was the bitch and Ling Shuang was as innocent as a rabbit… Yu Yaoyao would never believe it.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao tightened her fist.</p>
<p>Regardless of if she were innocent or not, Yu Yaoyao would teach her a lesson and send a message to any who dared provoke her.</p>
<p>“You made who feel peace of mind?” Shen Yichong’s low voice sounded behind her.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao trembled. A thick down jacket was placed on her shoulders.</p>
<p>“What are you doing on the balcony without a jacket?” Shen Yichong asked, “You’re alone, who are you talking to? To whom did you make a promise?” Shen Yichong’s handsome eyes were a little gloomy. He reached out and took her cold hand.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao made as if to answer but only managed an, “Ermm…” she shrunk down, tucking her head down between her shoulders.</p>
