<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao was aloof after that. She was done with her audition and remained seated, looking at the beautiful sparkling beach in the gentle breeze with a somber expression. She was so sad that the thought of helping the other two families wasn’t as appealing as it was before.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong noticed this, and he wanted to make her feel better. He insisted on a walk through the sandy beach. She obliged reluctantly. He talked sweetly to her; he talked about the most mundane things. After a while, she began to smile.</p>
<p>Halfway through the walk, she was distracted by the smell of delicious food. The barbecue area had been set up by the broadcast team as a game requirement for other families. Yu Yaoyao smiled in delight and followed the smell to the set-up. The barbecue area already had several people crowding in. Photographers stood around shooting those people.</p>
<p>“Honey!” exclaimed Yu Yaoyao, “I think they are the other families!”</p>
<p>Shen Rui, who was riding on Shen Yichong’s shoulders, perked up at her words. “Mommy! I see them!” he said in excitement, “Should we go help them?” Little Bun had enjoyed the show, and the tasks. He was excited to get into it again, especially because he would get to do it with his parents.</p>
<p>The thing that Director Zhao had tried to avoid at all costs now faced him glaringly through the monitor that he was seated before.</p>
<p>The three families had been stationed in the same hotel. Yu Yaoyao had bumped into Ren Sitong, the wife of a rich actor, in the hallway of the hotel. That was why Yu Yaoyao had wanted to help the other families, because Ren Sitong had been sad when she talked to her about the show and how she had been unable to find him until now.</p>
<p>Now, Ren Sitong was at the barbecue area, participating in the task. Yu Yaoyao led Shen Yichong to a nearby tent set up for the game. They seated themselves at the long table. The table held trays of four grilled chicken wings. All of a sudden, Yu Yaoyao’s mood brightened. She loved her chicken wings like nothing else in the whole wide world.</p>
<p>However, usually such greasy and oily food was restricted from her diet. Ni Yi took care of her diet so she remained in shape for her roles. Yu Yaoyao couldn’t leave without having at least one, so she stayed adamant.</p>
<p>“Can I have one of those?” she asked Shen Yichong, “Just this once.”</p>
<p>The chicken wings looked divine. The meat looked golden and crispy, topped with chilli flakes and cumin. Shen Yichong stayed there with her, however long she wanted, to cheer her up. “That is probably for the game, though,” he said, “I don’t know if they will give you one.”</p>
<p>Before she could respond, four people walked in and sat on the chair placed alongside the table: a girl, a middle-aged man, a boy, and a very old man. The staff member entered the tent and stood in front of the long table.</p>
<p>“Sister Ren, please listen carefully,” the staff explained, “The four chicken wings are flavored differently. You need to guess the person who eats the salty one. If your guess is correct, you will get a hint for your husband’s next location.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong had already seen Yu Yaoyao when she entered the tent. She waved at her and stood nervously listening to the instruction by the staff.</p>
<p>“You can begin,” said the staff, gesturing to the four people.</p>
<p>The girl took a huge bite and frowned. She quickly covered her mouth with her hand. The middle-aged man took a bite and downed a whole glass of water. The boy hesitated, before tearing off a chunk from the chicken wing. He wrinkled his face and dropped his chopsticks. The old man calmly picked up the grilled wings and took a bite, then ate it again.</p>
<p>“Sister Ren,” called the staff, “It’s your turn to take a guess.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong stood frowning, deep in thought. “It should not be the first one. She ate only a little, but her reaction was so dramatic,” explained Ren Sitong, “It should either be from the second or the third person. The fourth person seemed so calm and normal. But maybe the program wants me to think that.”</p>
<p>“Have you decided your answer?” asked the staff, smiling encouragingly.</p>
<p>“I guess I will go with the fourth—,” said Ren Sitong as she was interrupted by Yu Yaoyao suddenly.</p>
<p>“No, no!” yelled Yu Yaoyao. Ren Sitong turned to see Yu Yaoyao shaking her head fiercely. The smile on the face of the staff became strained. “It’s not the fourth person. He had such a satisfied look in his eyes, just like when I eat deliciously cooked steak. His grilled wings must have been yummy. He took a second bite too.”</p>
<p>Ren Sitong was at a loss for words. Director Zhao wanted to swallow his handkerchief, which he was using to dab his forehead.</p>
<p>“Number one, then,” said Ren Sitong, uncertainly, smiling at Yu Yaoyao. The staff looked ready to proceed, and Director Zhao seemed to have calmed down in front of his monitor. But Yu Yaoyao’s voice rang out again.</p>
