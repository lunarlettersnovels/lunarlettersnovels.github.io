            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 90 – The Little Flower’s Tricks (2)</strong></p>
<p>“At an obvious glance, there is already a massive difference between beggars and my own temperament. If I am able to perform a topic flawlessly, the judges will naturally decide that I have profound acting skills. After all, I’m also too good-looking and I rarely get dirty all over, but with a big performance stage present–I want to act this the most.”</p>
<p>“Sister, what’s the last thing you want to do?” The bottom-ranked woman’s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao covered her mouth and giggled, “Of course, it’s obviously the cheating madam. It’s taboo and I don’t want to play such a role again.”</p>
<p>“Sister, I know. I’ll keep it for you!” the girl suddenly became relieved, and both her shoulders relaxed down easily.</p>
<p>She quickly took advantage of Yu Yaoyao being preoccupied chatting with the other contestants to make her way towards the wall by the window. Not long after, Meng Xinran’s minion who was the fifth ranked player, pretended to watch the weather and went towards the window to look around. Afterward, she secretly took back a note. And towards the blind corner of the camera, she tucked the note into her pocket and hastily walked back to Meng Xinran.</p>
<p>She whispered, “Elder sister, she wants to choose road beggar and the last topic she wants to act is a cheating madam.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Meng Xinran gave Yu Yaoyao an unexpected look, but she soon chuckled.</p>
<p>“Beggar? She’s smarter than I thought–this role can prove that she is not just a vase. Then… we will help her!”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran hid the hatred in her eyes and smiled softly.</p>
<p>“Since she wants to get rid of her status as a mere vase, let her see to it to the end! Isn’t the performace topic of cheating madam more suitable for her <em>true</em> colors?”</p>
<p>The fifth contestant also smirked in reply and nodded, “In a while, Xiao Qi will be the first to pick. I’ll let her hide the cheating madam topic to give it to me before I go in. The rest of the topics are for ours to choose. And for brother Dajian… he… of course he won’t choose this female-centered topic. It will only be left to Yu Yaoyao!”</p>
<p>“If they also see the road beggar topic—I’ll tell them to choose another topic instead.”</p>
<p>Meng Xinran smiled, “If you do see it, you can leave it for me.”</p>
<p>She was reminded by Yu Yaoyao that they were standing in almost a similar light—she was known to be sweet and lovely, yet her future in other acting topics was limited. Therefore, this performance would greatly benefit her; acting as a beggar may let the directors see more sides of her, leading to better opportunities!</p>
<p><em>Thank you for reminding me, Yu Yaoyao!</em></p>
<p>“Yes, Sister Ran, then we’ll get read now.”</p>
<p>The group of girlfriends dissolved in the next moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p>The contestants entered the room one by one to choose their topic. Soon, it was Meng Xinran’s turn. She glanced back at Yu Yaoyao and entered the room with a knowing smile.</p>
<p>The fourth to tenth and the last contestant were all her allies.</p>
<p>As Meng Xinran walked into the room with confidence, there were indeed, only the two expected topics left. She was so lucky that she really has the road beggar topic left to her!</p>
<p>She smiled and picked up the paper and made her way out of the room.</p>
<p>With her usual sweet face, she passed by Yu Yaoyao, who was in the midst of walking towards the room. “Elder sister, I choose the road beggar topic. I hope you don’t mind,” she added the last phrase, her face was full of excitement waiting for the other party to collapse.</p>
<p>“And I left you favorite topic to you—the cheating madam. Sister you must advance~”</p>
<p><em>Come on, play your infidelity in front of the public and reveal your true colors—don’t think you’ll get away from being bashed to death! Hahaha!</em></p>
<p>Meng Xinran almost guffawed on the spot, but she ultimately controlled her giddiness with her acting. She was very sure that what she told Yu Yaoyao just now would not be recorded properly. Even if in the off-chance that it would be part of the clip, she can just pretend that she didn’t hear from before that Yu Yaoyao actually wanted this topic for herself!</p>
<p><em>And they’d think, who would have thought that beautiful Yu Yaoyao would be inclined to playing a beggar?</em></p>
