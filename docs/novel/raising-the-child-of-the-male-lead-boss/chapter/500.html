<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 263 – A Couple’s Understanding (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Zhao Yu covered his face in his hands, sighing. He had been an idiot to believe him. Shen Yichong had left the words on the note based on his son’s preferences. There had been only one place the entire time.</p>
<p>Zhao Yu sighed. It seemed there was no end to his sighs today. “I am convinced, Mr. Shen,” he said, “that your company had never faced bankruptcy.”</p>
<p>He turned to the staff to call the others around Yu Yaoyao to ask her the reason for her choice of location. The staff relayed this to her.</p>
<p>“Does that mean I got it right?” she said, her face lighting up, “I picked the correct one, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>The staff was expressionless. “It’s a question we ask the participants,” he responded, “Whether it is right or wrong depends solely on you.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao let out a disappointed sigh. “My husband left me three words, as you all know,” she explained, “I discussed with Little Bun about the location. The place must have flowers, food, especially meat, and a self-service facility.” She looked at Shen Rui in her arm. “We had a little disagreement at this point but Little Bun was sure that his daddy will have chosen a place with all of these things, and a place for children to play,” she continued, “So, he thinks it will be a place near an amusement park.” The staff raised his eyebrow. If they had chosen Amusement park, it would have been wrong.</p>
<p>“But I think my husband would never be kidnapped in an amusement park even if it took all his willpower,” she said, glancing at the camera, “he is a workaholic. I barely get to spend time with him because he is always busy.” She glanced at the staff with pain in her eyes. “I think as long as he is alive, he will be occupied with thoughts about his work. So, if he had a choice, he would go somewhere with all the things mentioned in the note but quieter, preferably with office buildings.”</p>
<p>Everyone was quiet. Shen Yichong and Director Zhao on the other side of the screen had been listening intently. After a long silence the staff asked, “So you chose the place with the riverside park?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said proudly, “That place has flowers, food, a park for children to play, and is surrounded by office buildings. My choice and Shen Rui’s overlaps there. So we decided on it together.” She hugged Shen Rui. He looked proud of their teamwork.</p>
<p>The staff asked the question that Director Zhao wanted answered. “There is no mention of ‘work’ or ‘office’ in the words he left you. So how are you certain?”</p>
<p>“That’s an excellent question,” she smiled and took out the slip of paper that Shen Yichong had left for her in the washroom before, “Do you see the ‘Hands-on’ in the middle? I took it to mean ‘working’. He has to stay idle for forty-eight hours.” She chuckled. “He must be going mad. Knowing him, he would find a place where he can work, or at least something which provides him with an illusion of a work environment.”</p>
<p>Director Zhao laughed. “Mr. Shen, you two are truly ‘on the same page’,” he said sarcastically. Shen Yichong’s interpretation and Yu Yaoyao’s were completely different but both had reached the same conclusion based on their own understanding of the other person. Even if he joked about it, he was impressed by them both.</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled. “We both have our own ways but eventually we reach the same conclusion.”</p>
<p>“Alright, but don’t be too happy about it,” Director Zhao said, “The staff in the specific location will set up three ‘rescue’ stages and only if she passes these levels will she be able to reach you. Okay, Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong wasn’t daunted. He kept his casual smile and a little bit of sympathy in his eyes for Director Zhao. “Director Zhao,” he said, “Do you think that the obstacle will faze Yu Yaoyao under the temptation of food?”</p></div>
