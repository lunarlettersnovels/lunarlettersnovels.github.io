            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 295 – Desperate Women (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>Translator: Lunarise<br>
Editor: Namita Suberi</em></p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao happily accompanied James and conversed with him backstage. She knew nothing about matching outfits and their color but since she had spent a lot of her time in nature, she was born with a good understanding of it.</p>
<p>James relayed to her that the spring collection had drawn its inspiration from natural scenery and his childhood memory of spring. That night, ADORE released an official post announcing their collaboration.</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao went home happy. She let out a mock scream of despair when she reached, “Oh no, I haven’t finished reading the chapters!”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smirked. She was being dramatic to mock him. “Well, then,” he said pretending to be stern, “Are you ready to be punished?” He pulled her close by the waist. “What should I do with you?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao blushed and covered her chest. “Let’s sort this out gently,” she said pretending to be complaining, “I will let you try out a new posture if you are gentle.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong was speechless. He pulled her close. Suffice it to say, there wasn’t any punishment that both didn’t crave from their hearts.</p>
<p>“Darling, look,” she said, “I got a text from Gu Qianqian. It’s a warning.” She revealed this in a fit to distract him, and perhaps annoy him. She smiled when she saw Shen Yichong smirk but caught herself and pretended to be nervous.</p>
<p>“Hm, it seems to me that you received it last night,” he said, “But you just found out? What a delay. It has been almost twenty-four hours.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao pouted. “Last night,” she mused, “How would I have found any time to check my phone when I was with you?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smirked. “Maybe we should make an exception,” he said softly, “Notify me when you receive such a dangerous message ASAP, alright?”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao beamed. “Darling, they always use the same trick to harm me,” she said, “Do you think I am too smart, or they are too stupid?”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smiled. In his opinion, anyone trying to harm anybody in the industry seemed silly. “I will ask Chen Lin to check the IP address of the person,” he said, trying to assure her, “Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to,” she said, “I can figure it out myself who is trying to land me into trouble.”</p>
<p>Yu Yaoyao had started observing people more than usual. It had started after she had a discussion with Director Qi Hang.  He had asked her to study people around her, especially women as an example to build on her role. So, she had observed women around her diligently, trying to understand them. It not only helped her learn more to make her character authentic but also gave her an insight on people’s behavior. When it came down to it, she found people really interesting.</p>
<p>“Honestly, though,” she said, “Why are they so persistent? They try so hard even when they fail every single time. I really do admire their tenacity.” Yu Yaoyao sighed. Meng Xinran had been arrested and Gu Qianqian, who had tried to land her in trouble, was sending her alarms this time. Why do people want to mess with her anyway?</p>
<p>“Do you mean Yu Xinjie?” asked Shen Yichong, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“No,” she blurted out, “It’s Ling Shuang!”</p>
<p>She turned to him, reaching out a hand and placing it on his shoulders. “Darling,” she said hurriedly, “I know what they will say this time. They will probably falsely accuse me of cheating on you.” She pouted. “Please don’t believe them. I would never do such a thing! I have only spent my time with you, or Shen Rui. I haven’t even met anyone else except you.”</p>
<p>Shen Yichong smirked. “Well, you eat with your ‘wife’,” he said, jokingly.</p>
<p>“Hehe,” said Yu Yaoyao, “As you know Sisi is super cute but—”</p>
<p>Her sentence was cut short as he raised his eyebrows and pulled her close to him by the waist. “I will send someone to investigate it,” he added, “and warn them to behave.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said, giving in to his embrace.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ling Shuang suffered the consequences. She received a call from Chen Lin, assistant to Shen Yichong, from Guangxin. She looked at the rejection notice of her recent audition to two more roles in movies that Guangxin invested in. She had been given a notice to not audition for any more movies that Guangxin was involved in.</p>
<p>“What does he mean by it?” she exclaimed, outraged, “He told me his boss doesn’t want me to act in any movies that Guangxin invests in! But why?”</p>
<p>She turned to Chen Jiao, agonized. “I admit that I might have made a mistake in the youth drama,” she said, recalling her humiliation at the hands of Yu Yaoyao. “But I did very well in the other two auditions!”</p>
<p>Chen Jiao frowned. “At the audition that day you talked back to Yu Yaoyao, right?” she asked, “You asked her for a demonstration.”</p>
<p>“I… I was being impulsive! I was angry,” she said, helplessly, “But I apologized to her. Mr. Shen isn’t someone who is known to be unreasonable.” Ling Shuang simply refused to accept it. Shen Yichong couldn’t ban her from appearing in any drama at all sponsored by Guangxin just because she talked back to Yu Yaoyao. “Impossible!” she cried, “He just can’t order his assistant to say this. It must be Yu Yaoyao’s doing.” Her voice was getting shriller.</p>
