            <p>Woo-jin cut off Hae-gang’s thoughts with a single, sharp statement, a small sigh escaping from his mouth. The reason for his insomnia was clear, but he couldn’t bring himself to share it with her.</p>
<p>“Is it because I’m here? You slept well at home.”</p>
<p>The tinkling of the nearby bell was irritating, sounding like a sparrow. She had slept well at home, where there was nothing to disturb her. However, here in the Maldives, the sensations of the day played over and over again in his mind. He saw Hae-gang’s face, a breathtakingly beautiful sight, with her moist lips and her breasts tightly wrapped in his hands. It had been three days since they had stayed up all night together, and tonight seemed like it would be no different. The night sky of the Maldives was proving to be a boring place.</p>
<p>Woo-jin felt it was unfair. Why should he suffer alone like this, ruining his condition? The woman he had been with seemed perfectly fine. He didn’t realize that their difference in affection caused him to feel that way.</p>
<p>“I dug my own grave.”</p>
<p>He had never anticipated that the feeling he had been trying to shake off would linger for so long.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>The cinema had been a delightful experience. The film screened under the vast expanse of the starry sky had an air of romance that was perfect for the newlyweds to watch. Perhaps it was the special location, but it left an indelible impression on Hae-gang. She waited until the end credits had rolled before giving herself a little round of applause. This movie was truly worth watching. She realized for the first time that the same movie could be viewed entirely differently, depending on the ambiance and surroundings.</p>
<p>As they made their way back to the resort on a boat driven by Coral, Woo-jin hinted at a cocktail. “Would you like a cocktail?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Sure,” Hae-gang replied.</p>
<p>It was the first time that Woo-jin had offered her a drink since their honeymoon, so she nodded her head coldly. After they returned to the resort and washed up, the cocktails were ready, accompanied by light snacks. The Mojito, the signature cocktail of the Maldives, was enticing, boasting a fresh color that seemed to encourage her to drink it quickly.</p>
<p>As she took a sip of the cocktail, the bitterness hidden behind the sweet taste adorned her mouth, and after a brief moment, she rolled her eyes and looked at Woo-jin from a little distance away. He had spent most of the day sleeping, as he had announced in the morning. Hae-gang wasn’t bored, though. Even though she had been awake for several days, she had observed him with ease. At first, she watched him from a moderate distance. Woo-jin slept in a straight posture, not moving much, so the blanket was not disturbed. It was amazing, and the fact that she was getting closer and closer quickly made her cling to the bed. He probably wouldn’t know for the rest of his life that her hand had rubbed his face a little.</p>
<p>“Min Woo-jin, can I ask you something?” Hae-gang finally mustered the courage to ask what had been on her mind for a few days. “Was it really just to make you feel better, or was there some other reason?”</p>
<p>No answer came back from Woo-jin, leaving Hae-gang crestfallen. She pursed her lips and downed the cocktail in one gulp. She had pretended to be okay throughout the trip, but her head was as noisy as a monkey running around. She wanted to get rid of this monkey before they returned to Korea. Hae-gang got up from her seat to talk to Woo-jin again and approached him, hoping that he would not ignore her if she spoke right next to him. However, the situation took an entirely unexpected turn.</p>
<p>“Mr. Woo-jin Min?” Hae-gang called out to him.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s gaze did not match hers at all, and the cocktail glass in his hand crashed to the floor.</p>
<p>“Ah, really!” Hae-gang exclaimed, surprised. She bent down on her knees to pick up the glass, but that was all she could do. Even when the sticky cocktail drenched her bare feet, she was frozen like a plaster cast and could not move.</p>
<p>It was Woo-jin’s head that landed on her shoulder at the same time as the cocktail. She could feel the heat radiating off of him, and it didn’t take her long to realize that he was drunk. “Hey, are you drunk right now?” she asked him.</p>
<p>Again, no answer came back. Hae-gang took one more sip of the remaining cocktail in her confused mind and let out a grand sigh. She hadn’t even thought about it, but it seemed that this guy was an alcoholic scumbag, unlike anyone else.</p>
