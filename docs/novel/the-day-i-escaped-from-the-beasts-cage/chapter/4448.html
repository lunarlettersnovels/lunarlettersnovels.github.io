            <p>Woo-jin has had an eventful six years.</p>
<p>His mother, who had been weak for some time, died young, and Chairman Min, a devoted father, suffered from everything and was involved in a car accident while drunk one day.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who unexpectedly rose to the position of CEO, changed his name from “Seora” to “Charlie” at the age of 30 and jumped into full-fledged management. It was never easy for him to grow and strengthen the business.</p>
<p>Every day was so hectic, and during that time, Hae-gang was gradually forgotten.</p>
<p>The procedure was simply because they had not met since that day.</p>
<p>Of course, he had to put in a lot of effort at first. They might run into each other somewhere. Then he wonders if the feelings he felt that day will be remembered.</p>
<p>Even though he was interested in Moon Ik, he didn’t go to any of the meetings about her because he wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>And Woo-jin quickly realized that his efforts were unnecessary. Hae-gang has not shown her face to any position or media since entering Moon Ik.</p>
<p>He hadn’t heard from her, and he wasn’t going to bother finding out.</p>
<p>He did</p>
<p>There are 217 passengers on board, including 13 crew members, and it is unknown whether they are alive or dead. The entertainer Han Chang-Hyun and Seo Jong-min’s family members have also been confirmed to be on the flight. Chairman Seo Jong-un’s youngest daughter, Seo Hae-gang, met Moon Ik’s Yoon five years ago.</p>
<p>Woo-jin was frozen in place as he watched the real-time news on a large screen in the lobby of Charlie’s headquarters.</p>
<p>“What are you discussing now?”</p>
<p>Why is her name escaping from there?</p>
<p>He couldn’t hear the chief of staff next to him because of his tangled and confused head.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who had been staring at the screen for some time, finally started to think.</p>
<p><em>How can I get her out of that terrifying situation?</em></p>
<p>This time, the clever mind did not come up with a viable solution. Woo-jin never stopped thinking, even when he was frustrated.</p>
<p>What are his options now? What would be most beneficial to Hae-gang? How can he get them to step safely onto Korean soil?</p>
<p>Whether such a thing existed or if it was too late, various questions gnawed at his mind, but there was no time to waste.</p>
<p>“Manager Han.”</p>
<p>“Sir, yes.”</p>
<p>“Check the accident scene in real-time and notify me.” How many people can we send for emergency response? No matter how much it is, gather as much as you can and send it immediately for help.</p>
<p>Woo-jin dashed inside, carrying an answer from the chief of staff, who was staring at the screen without blinking.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who remained alone in the lobby, hasn’t looked away from the screen in a long time. His heart began to race at an alarming rate. He couldn’t figure out why his heart was racing so fast.</p>
<p>He hadn’t lived in a long time and thought it was just a new sensation. Nothing has changed since it has not been in the news for six years.</p>
<p>It was a different story when he couldn’t see, despite knowing there was something there.</p>
<p>Following that, the procedure was the same as in other disasters.</p>
<p>The news told people that the government and big U.S. companies had sent out a lot of people and were working together to save them all over the world.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of people who contributed, the time it took to obtain it was also quick.</p>
<p>No, “getting it out” was correct rather than “getting it.” They only brought bodies back from the sea.</p>
<p>He couldn’t sleep with the death toll rising by the hour on a news screen tinged with hope and despair.</p>
<p>He knew her chances of surviving the plane crash were slim, but Woo-jin hoped the slim chance would strike her. Three days after the crash of the AL-701, Woo-jin saw Hae-gang’s name in the news and wondered how it felt to dry blood day by day.</p>
<p><strong>Seo Hae Kang has passed away. </strong></p>
<p>The news focused on Moon Ik’s departure, but none of that mattered to Woo-jin. Only one sentence remained in his mind.</p>
<p>Hae-gang River has died.</p>
