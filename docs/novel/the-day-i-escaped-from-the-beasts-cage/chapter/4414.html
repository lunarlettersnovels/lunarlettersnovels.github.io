        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s body shuddered as she reached her peak of pleasure. Woo-jin’s teeth gritted against the pressure, their teeth meshing together. Without hesitation, he moved quickly.</p>
<p>“Wait, haha! Aww… Yes!”</p>
<p>Hae-gang, who had already climaxed, couldn’t resist the pleasure and pushed Woo-jin away, but he didn’t mind. Woojin grabbed her hand, pushing his chest and wrapping his hand around her neck.</p>
<p>“Stop, please, stop!”</p>
<p>As the intervals between each thrust became shorter, waves of pleasure surged through Hae-gang’s body. She hit the peaks of ecstasy, one after another, feeling like she couldn’t handle it any longer.</p>
<p>Woo-jin twisted his waist tightly as if trying to evade the climax, thrusting himself deeper inside Hae-gang and exhaling a long breath.</p>
<p>“Haha! Under! Uh… ”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s ribs rose and fell with each of his exhaled breaths. Sensing her distress, Woo-jin hugged her upper body.</p>
<p>As Hae-gang relinquished her drained body to him, her vision blurred and her back arched. When she regained her senses, she found herself on top of Woo-jin.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go again?”</p>
<p>“If you’re only going to do it once, then I’m not worried about your stamina.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang was taken aback by the intensity of Woo-jin’s gaze. She couldn’t believe that someone so cool and composed could exude such raw passion. Not wanting to spoil the moment, she ran her hand over his taut abs and lifted her waist.</p>
<p>With each movement, her arms trembled helplessly. She couldn’t handle the pressure of the deeper penetration, and her untied hair tickled her cheeks and chest. Despite her discomfort, she couldn’t let go of Woo-jin’s hands, for fear of collapsing under the intensity of their lovemaking.</p>
<p>Hae-gang closed her eyes for a moment before reopening them, lost in the throes of pleasure.</p>
<p>Hae-gang let out a deep breath as her body trembled, and Woo-jin responded with a short moan as if her insides were tightening in time. The growing sense of volume made their breathing stop intermittently, and for a while, they couldn’t even move. Sweat ran down Hae-gang’s back, and it was exhausting to move, yet staying still made her increasingly impatient.</p>
<p>As she let out a cry, Woo-jin took Hae-gang’s hair, which was drooping like a curtain, and checked her complexion. Hae-gang rested her cheek on her palm, just like Woo-jin did earlier.</p>
<p>“Should I be sorry for whining?” Hae-gang asked, feeling slightly embarrassed.</p>
<p>Woo-jin rested his free hand gently on Hae-gang’s shoulder. A hand as soft as it was strange ran down her sweaty back along the vertebrae, and Hae-gang’s waist shook lightly at the sharp sensation.</p>
<p>“Should I be cute?” Hae-gang asked again.</p>
<p>As Woo-jin put strength at the end of his words and lifted his waist, the sound of flesh clashing resounded. Hae-gang couldn’t even groan properly; only her mouth opened.</p>
<p>“Ugh…” Hae-gang groaned as she straightened her broken elbow and gritted her teeth.</p>
<p>After a while, Woo-jin held her pelvis firmly at a slower and slower speed.</p>
<p>“I don’t expect much,” Woo-jin said.</p>
<p>“Huh,” Hae-gang responded.</p>
<p>“Just hold on,” Woo-jin said as he began bouncing his waist rhythmically. It wasn’t long before Hae-gang’s body completely overlapped Woo-jin’s at the vivid feeling of tapping on his deep place.</p>
<p>Hae-gang searched for Woo-jin’s lips in an attempt to somehow hold on to the nerves that seemed to be lost at any moment. Woo-jin, who had been digging into her mouth as if he had waited, swept the roof of her mouth and pushed his genitals deep.</p>
<p>The breath they heard right next to them was so hot that it felt like their ears would melt. No, not just their ears, but their entire bodies.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>As Hae-gang gradually lifted her heavy eyelids, her gaze met Woo-jin’s enigmatic expression. She sensed that he wouldn’t be receptive to the excuse that he couldn’t recall anything from the previous night, blaming it on the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>It had been a while since Hae-gang had woken up next to someone after a fling, but the feeling was oddly comforting. She buried her face in the pillowcase and let out a small laugh, not because of the warmth, but to conceal her apprehension.</p>
<p>“What’s on your mind?” Woo-jin inquired, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to put into words,” Hae-gang replied, raising her upper body despite the pain signals from her body. The motion caused the blanket to slide down her shoulder, but before it could go any further, she pulled it up again and turned to face Woo-jin.</p>
<p>He spoke calmly, almost as if he had rehearsed what he was going to say, “I didn’t mean to take advantage of the situation, nor did I make any mistakes because of the alcohol.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang remained silent, offering only a faint smile in response. It was her way of conveying that she understood what he meant.</p>
<p>She had initially thought that blaming the atmosphere and alcohol for their one-night stand would have been the easiest way out. However, she had erred by placing too much significance on Woo-jin and allowing herself to become attached. The distance between them had gradually dwindled, and she found herself seeking solace in his good intentions.</p>
<p>It was this closeness that now frightened her. What if they grew accustomed to having each other around for the next three years? That was a prospect that she couldn’t fathom, and the thought sent shivers down her spine.</p>
