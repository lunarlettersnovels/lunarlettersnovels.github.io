            <p>Due to the height of the railing, Hae-gang’s feet float in the air, and the shoes of the same color, which are concealed in the hem of the long dress, sway back and forth. After a while of playing on the railing, she began to speak with a tiny sigh.</p>
<p>“I’m getting married in a few months, but I’m feeling somewhat restless.” “I’m scared and troubled about my ability to adapt because his family is so large.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>She doesn’t mind that Woo-jin is silently listening, so she glares at him and pokes his arm.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, are you able to pretend to respond to me when I speak to you?”</p>
<p>It stings oddly, despite the strength of the fingernails or contact with the fabric. He slightly retracted his shoulder to avoid his hand and responded without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“I cannot empathize because I am not yet married.”</p>
<p>“This is merely a formal encouragement, correct?”</p>
<p>I’ll do well. I will be able to do similar things. “There is nothing exceptional about the family.”</p>
<p>It seems that she has already received the response she desired. However, Woo-jin avoided saying anything he did not intend.</p>
<p>“I don’t know Ms. Seo Hae-gang, so I’m not sure how well you’ll do, and the family will be a little different.”</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>He was a little embarrassed by the idea that the Hae-gang was too rough, so he gave more information.</p>
<p>“However, I do not believe it is necessary to adapt.” Make every effort you can. If you request more, divorce is one option.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>A loud, laughter-filled voice resounded over the nighttime sky. She appeared to be quite content, yet she regarded my words with reproof.</p>
<p>Divorce is not a fault in today’s society.</p>
<p>“I intend to have a fulfilling life.”</p>
<p>Obviously, Woo-jin did not believe Hae-gang would not survive and be mistreated. because no one in the world would hold such a person in contempt.</p>
<p>Then he need not be concerned.</p>
<p>“No, but you are still concerned for me. It’s not a negative thing to be worried about someone.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin laughed out loud at the sincere comments that he would never make if he were himself.</p>
<p>“Oh? You just laughed.”</p>
<p>“I laugh when something is humorous. If you do not do so, you are a machine, not a person.”</p>
<p>Then, he responds with eyes gleaming like those of a police officer who has counted the number of instances.</p>
<p>“Until now, you looked like a robot.” In particular, you should write down the answers to your questions as soon as you ask them.</p>
<p>Woo-jin then exhales deeply and raises his head. It appeared that a pleasant aroma emanated from his smiling face. Possibly because of that, his once harsh manner of speaking has become more kind.</p>
<p>“The future husband will aid in Seo Hae-gang’s adaptation.”</p>
<p>” I’m not sure. I don’t have much faith in him.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you planning a wedding?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin did not find this inquiry impolite. That is likely true. Currently, it is premature to talk about marriage at age 23. What led him to make such a hasty judgment devoid of credibility?</p>
<p>“I like it. I am a person who lacks words and humor, but it’s good to be kind to me, and it’s good to have confidence that I’m not easily swayed. He is a cool person. When I am with him, I am thrilled and content.”</p>
<p>The Hae-gang body leaned in closer to him. She spoke gently, as though she were revealing a secret she had kept to herself.</p>
<p>“He was also handsome and maternal!”</p>
<p>The reason why the words that began as a whisper turned into a shout was because her body tipped without her realizing it.</p>
<p>The body of Hae-gang trembled violently, possibly because it lost its balance while leaning to one side. Woo-jin frantically reached for the body that appeared to be about to tumble back.</p>
<p>“Oh my!”</p>
<p>Fortunately, she did not fall to the ground due to the timely arm grab. She drew a futile breath as if she were truly shocked.</p>
<p>This style requires a great deal of effort. Woo-jin had noticed the bump before, so he put his arm around her waist and lowered her off the edge in a safer way.</p>
<p>Despite the chilly air, warmth automatically emanates from touching bodies.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>And when Hae-gang, who was partially in his arms, raised his head, Woo-jin immediately recognized his trembling heart.</p>
<p>Peach-colored cheeks that glowed with life and two eyes that shone brightly even in the dim moonlight.</p>
<p>Woo-jin recognized for the first time in his life that people can be lovely when he saw Hae-gang’s face.  Even after hearing what he was feeling, he did not comprehend what it was like. Woo-jin never expected to feel this way.</p>
<p>Hae-gang opened her mouth with a weird expression, as if the hand she was holding on her chest had transmitted her heartbeat.</p>
<p>“My greatest concern is that he is not on my side. I wonder if he’s losing his family because he takes my side too often.”</p>
<p>A bitter smile appeared on Woo-Jin’s face as he listened to the narrative of her future spouse, which was told at the precise moment as if drawing a line.</p>
<p><em>You made an excellent choice.</em></p>
<p>Woo-jin had to learn how to accept the realization of his lost first love.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Seo Hae-gang, on your marriage.”</p>
<p>The first individual he fell in love with was a bride-to-be who was soon to be married.</p>
<p>Woo-jin decided that the feelings he was having right now would go away on their own, so he was not emotionally stable enough to do something dangerous.</p>
<p>Six years later, he learned about Hae-gang’s passing from an unexpected source.</p>
<p>New information: At about 13:20 local time today, an Area Airlines flight bound for Guam, AL-701, crashed into the South Pacific.</p>
