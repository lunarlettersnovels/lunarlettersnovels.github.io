            <p>Meanwhile, after Woo-jin entered the study, Hae-gang remained standing for a while.</p>
<p>The voice she heard after a long time gave her goosebumps all over her body.</p>
<p>Why did he call Woo-jin? Did he realize she was here? She thought her head was turning white, but the earthenware was tilted.</p>
<p>Hae-gang rushed to the bathroom and vomited. Lunch, which had not yet been digested, poured down with a sour smell. She worried that Woo-jin could hear the sound only after he lifted his stomach.</p>
<p>She locked the door that she couldn’t close because she was busy coming in and lowered her head again. Tears streamed down. She wasn’t going to cry anymore today.</p>
<p>tears, a runny nose, and vomit. In addition, it was a mess enough without looking at her face, which must have turned red with the blood drawn. To calm her increasing body temperature, she poured cold water on her face and washed her face.</p>
<p>“I’m tired.”</p>
<p>Until a while ago, her mind, which was excited at the thought of going on a trip, drooped like wet cotton. She wanted to rest anywhere as it is.</p>
<p>Hae-gang, who walked into the guest room as if she were dragging her feet, collapsed on the bed without even thinking of changing her clothes.</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s eyes were red and showed signs of a serious fever. All she wanted to do was fall asleep and forget everything. However, a knock at the door interrupted his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Ms. Han Dawn, are you here?” a worried Woo-jin asked.</p>
<p>Hae-gang slowly got up from the bed and opened the door. She vaguely remembered their earlier conversation about sleeping together.</p>
<p>“Can you sleep alone?” Woo-jin asked.</p>
<p>Hae-gang nodded in agreement, forgetting that she had just said the opposite a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>“It would have been possible if Min Woo-jin hadn’t knocked just now,” Hae-gang said.</p>
<p>Seeing her hands so cool, she seemed to have a fever that was getting worse. Woo-jin sighed quietly and grabbed her arm.</p>
<p>“But let’s sleep together. As you said, there’s no need to give doubt to the maid, and I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep because it bothers me.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin dragged her, and they climbed the stairs leading to the second floor as he dragged her. Perhaps because he was considerate of her, he held her back, which was slowly going up one by one, and moved his eyes to her arm.</p>
<p>His huge, hard hands, were unlike her slender arms. Hae-gang hurriedly brought up the assumption, which had been wandering in her head since he got a call from Sun-woo.</p>
<p>“If they’ll pay you any profit, and if they ask for me, will you give me to them?”</p>
<p>It was a thought that he might join hands with Moon Ik. Unlike someone who doesn’t have anything, there are many things they can do for Woo Jin.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s mouth gave a slight chuckle. It seems that the voice heard at the time contained a little irritation.</p>
<p>“Is there anyone in the world who gives their wife to others?”</p>
<p>It’s not that she didn’t understand his irritation, but she didn’t think he was right either.</p>
<p>It’s because he doesn’t know that there are people in the world who kill their wives. However, Woo-jin was fed up with living in a completely different world from such people.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about useless things. I think you overthink and you’re sick.”</p>
<p>No, he may be fed up with Hae-gang, which is full of foolish thoughts. Woo Jin, whom she’d seen so far, was relentless in that respect.</p>
<p>He has been busy since they entered the bedroom. They sat in bed, searched the drawer as if he were looking for something, gave up, and went downstairs again.</p>
<p>When he returned, he brought a fever reducer and pajamas with a rabbit on them.</p>
<p>After changing in the attached bathroom, Hae-gang sat on the seat he had vacated.</p>
<p>Even if she was asked to sleep together, it wouldn’t work overnight. She couldn’t lie down on her own, but her heavy head from the fever kept falling.</p>
<p>Hae-gang repeatedly did this until Woo-jin, who couldn’t watch, grabbed his shoulder and helped her lay down.</p>
<p>“We’re going to lie down side by side. Will it be okay with you if we share the bed?”</p>
<p><em>How can that mouth always say the right things?</em></p>
<p>Hae-gang didn’t have the energy to refute, so he laid down in peace, half giving up.</p>
<p>The shape of Woo-jin’s face, including his jawline and nose, came into view as far away as two bones.</p>
<p><em>How many times did he blink like that?</em></p>
<p>Repeatedly, Woo-jin’s appearance was covered by her eyelids and revealed again. Hae-gang realized that the presence of another person next to her was quite effective in stabilizing her mind.</p>
