            <p>“He” once saw the man on the news and gave a comment. He had said the word “bastard.” At that time, Hae-gang barely paid attention to him, but she could remember it more clearly than she thought.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to agree with him, but there was no question that this man was a bastard. Hae-gang voiced her resentment toward Woo-jin.</p>
<p>“You said you wouldn’t bring me to the hospital.”</p>
<p>“The only doctor I know is the one who just left,” he replied nonchalantly. “He’s expensive to call out of the hospital.”</p>
<p>“Still!”</p>
<p>“Or should you have held onto that broken arm and kept walking down the street?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang shut her mouth. There was no time for useless arguing. Woo-jin and the doctor did not seem to know her name yet, but “he” had eyes and ears everywhere. It was best for her to leave as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As she looked around to find her clothes, Woo-jin interrupted, “Are you looking for the clothes you were wearing?”</p>
<p>“Is there any problem?”</p>
<p>“The clothes you were wearing are not suitable for outside, especially in the middle of winter.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang was aware of this fact. When a fire broke out in the hotel, she was so distracted that she only grabbed a cardigan over the thin slip she was wearing, which was short enough to reveal her thighs. The hospital gown she was currently wearing would definitely provide more warmth.</p>
<p>“That’s my problem, so don’t worry about it.” “I need to get out of here right now.”</p>
<p>“It seems that your reluctance to go to the hospital was not simply because of fear.” “Why do you not want to reveal your identity?” Woo-jin interrogated.</p>
<p>Hae-gang wanted to correct his assumptions. <em>It’s not that I don’t want to reveal it, it’s that I can’t. </em>But she didn’t have the confidence to explain everything, so she gave him a brief summary of her current situation.</p>
<p>“I’m running away.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin furrowed his eyebrows. He seemed to be thinking about a lot of things but only asked one question.</p>
<p>“Are you a criminal?”</p>
<p>“No, I am not.”</p>
<p>“That’s all right then.” “Stay here until your arm is completely healed.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang, feeling frustrated, tried to argue, but Woo-jin spoke first.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but I’m pretty famous.” I have a lot of money, so I often get scammed, so I can’t trust it. “It’ll be a headache if something happens to you if you leave, so just stay here.”</p>
<p>“If you want, I’ll even sign an agreement.” Hae-gang pleaded, “Can you please send me away?”</p>
<p>“Well, if you have to.” But think smart. If you’re on the run, there’s no safer place than here.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang stared at Woo-jin with an incomprehensible expression. Looking at her, Woo-jin calmly explained, though he was unable to hide his annoyance.</p>
<p>“The person who just left is the vice president here, and he is quite close to me.” “Light offenses can be overlooked,” he said. “I asked him a favor.” He personally attended to you and put on a cast himself. The vice president will continue to take care of your treatment.”</p>
<p>His eyes pierced Hae-gang mercilessly.</p>
<p>“I won’t ask anymore, so stay.”</p>
<p>Only after he said the words she wanted to hear did Hae-gang relax her guard a little. There was a point in what he said. She was stubborn, but she didn’t know what to do if she left the hospital.</p>
<p>If she walked around in a hospital gown, she could be captured on someone else’s phone, or worse, a video of her could be posted on the internet. She might as well stay here.</p>
<p>Hae-gang didn’t want to stay in one place for a long time, thinking of the time she had been locked up, but above all else, avoiding the man’s eyes was the best thing she could do. <em>I can just think of this situation as a kind of temporary hiding place.</em></p>
<p>Hae-gang released a sigh. She felt she could finally relax her mind. <em>It’s just one crisis.</em></p>
<p>But the person she was running away from was someone who held more power than Woo-jin could imagine. She couldn’t afford to be relieved just because of that. Moreover, Woo-jin’s words had no credibility. He could no longer be trusted when he brought her to this hospital.</p>
<p>“Promise me for sure.” You won’t try to find my family. “You won’t know anything about me.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin nodded lightly at her words. But Hae-gang did not allay her suspicions. But even if she doubted him with all her being, there was no other way. She just wanted her body to rest.</p>
