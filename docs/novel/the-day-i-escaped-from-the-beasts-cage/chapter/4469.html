            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her safety. That was the reason ‘he’ claimed. ‘He’ wanted to keep her away from all threats. ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’ always wanted her to be within his view, within his reach, within his range of influence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, she believed all the sweet words that ‘he’ had said.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all for you.”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tell me when you feel better. Rest now.”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you go out in this state, I’m anxious.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When days of isolation stretched into half a year, Hae-gang suddenly realized. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, he has no intention of getting me out of here. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t have that thought in the first place. Half a year was the time it took for her body to recuperate after the accident, and it was also when the affection ‘he’ gave to her was becoming corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever it was, it was a very late realization. She was awakened by the shock as if she had been hit on the head with a hammer, and the remaining days of the year felt like hell. She wanted to leave; she could no longer stand it. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why are you doing this? You want me to see you go crazy?”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please let me go. Please!”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She repeatedly cried and prayed. She protested against him by inflicting pain on herself. She threatened to kill him and even threatened to die. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he didn’t bat an eye. When she cried, he comforted her; when she hit him, he accepted it; when she starved and collapsed, he called a doctor and gave her nutritional supplements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, he always</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> brought her back to his place and said calmly, without any change in expression, “I knew it was useless, so let’s just stop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at that moment she realized that all her attempts to escape the hellhole were futile and foolish. She trembled, feeling fear and betrayal. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can he do this to me? How can I look back at the good days we spent together with these memories? </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t understand him and she didn’t even want to. Still, there were times when she was curious. So she asked him, “How long do I have to live like this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She received no answer. She asked again, “Tell me. How long do I have to be here for you to be satisfied?” She felt like her stomach was going to explode at any moment. “Please give me an answer,” she begged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She needed to hear the answer. She needed to know when was the end of her suffering so she could live. If he gave her an answer, it would be enough to sustain her until her last breath. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She insisted, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The day when you won’t be anxious about me? The day my safety was ensured in any way?” Her voice quivered as she barely held back her tears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The day I don’t love you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the two years she has been imprisoned, today was the first time she received a response from him. Hae-gang’s pupils widened, and her lips trembled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She believed she would be able to see the sky at least once before she passed. Not the sky made of cement, not the sky through the window, but the real, vast sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with those words, ‘he’ shattered her hopes in mere seconds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Give up. That day will never come.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang tightened her grip on the sofa and scratched the leather. In anguish, she started throwing everything she could grab with her hand, starting with the coat he had taken off next to her. She screamed, “Why do I have to live like this? Why!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remote control flew off and smashed the TV. The faces of the laughing celebrities were contorted by the broken screen, but none of them cared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘He’ looked at Hae-gang with fierce eyes. Suddenly, her skinny body shook precariously, unable to contain her anger. She stretched out her hand to support her body as she staggered. ‘He’ approached her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not touch me!” yelled Hae-gang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hae-gang.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t come near me and don’t touch me. If you don’t get me out of here, you shouldn’t even stand in front of me!” Hae-gang screamed and grabbed a plastic cup on the table and threw it at him, her weak limbs swaying aimlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘He’, who had witnessed all of her emotions, embraced her regardless of her violent rejection. His touch gave her goosebumps and she wanted to break free from him immediately, but she couldn’t. She struggled with everything left in her—hitting, punched, and kicking him—but it was only in vain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang’s shoulders stiffened at the word that signaled the end. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of her repulsive realizations as a prisoner was that she had to stop when ‘he’ told her to stop. Hae-gang didn’t want to go through any more fainting during int*rcourse. Fearful, she ceased her protest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘He’ stroked her back with much gentleness as if to pacify her, but she couldn’t be more disgusted. Even more sickening than such a gesture was himself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt helpless and she resented herself; she now thought she was like a well-trained dog. </span></p>
