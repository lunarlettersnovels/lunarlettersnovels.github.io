        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>The words that had risen to the tip of her tongue quickly retreated. It wasn’t that she didn’t trust Woo-jin. She knew that Charlie’s company, which had caught up with Moon-ik’s right under his nose, and Woo-jin’s influence were in no way inferior to each other, but there was always the “what if” factor.</p>
<p>“I can’t say that.”</p>
<p>She didn’t want to tell the obvious lie that nothing had happened. Yet she couldn’t bring herself to tell the truth either. With a perplexed expression, Hae-gang cut off his question.</p>
<p>“Since I can’t answer no matter how much you ask, pretend you don’t know.”</p>
<p>A hint of irritation briefly flickered across Woo-jin’s face before disappearing. The worry that he might argue about this topic again was rendered futile as he nodded his head early on and took a step back.</p>
<p>“If Dawn Han wants it, I’ll do it, but honestly, it’s starting to bother me.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang bit her lip upon realizing that her actions were causing inconvenience to Woo-jin. The pain in the muscles of her cheeks, which involuntarily tensed up, started to itch again.</p>
<p>Woo-jin pulled his lips, which were in such a state, with his thumb and revealed a deeper emotion.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you’re aware, but when something bothers me, I feel better if I get rid of it. But in your case, it seems like I’ll be more concerned if I do.”</p>
<p>Feeling a strange sensation from his touch, which pressed firmly against her lips, she instinctively leaned her head back.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s an extension of what I said earlier in a general sense. I don’t like it when you keep secrets from me, and I don’t like facing unknown threats.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s voice resonated in her ears. Hae-gang stared at him, dazed.</p>
<p><em>What is this person trying to say right now?</em></p>
<p>“Dawn, I don’t think I want to divorce you.”</p>
<p>Even though his tone seemed as if he were conveying someone else’s feelings, his sincerity was unmistakable. She couldn’t even refuse.</p>
<p>“Of course, I don’t intend to force you, especially since there’s a contract. I didn’t say it to alleviate your burden either.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I just wish that when that day comes three years from now, you would consider continuing to live like this with me, at least once.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s lips trembled. She should say it’s not possible, but the words didn’t come out easily.</p>
<p><em>We were supposed to spend just three years together and then cleanly part ways. No, perhaps it would be wise to stamp our divorce papers and go our separate ways right now. That way, you would be safe, and I would have peace of mind.</em></p>
<p>That’s what I should say, clearly and decisively.</p>
<p>But her lips remained sealed. Even if she tried to open them, her voice wouldn’t come out easily. Hae-gang already knew the reason why.</p>
<p>She didn’t want it. She didn’t want to say it wasn’t possible.</p>
<p>Hae-gang bowed her head, afraid that her wavering eyes would reveal her trembling heart.</p>
<p>Yoon Sun-woo was right. He had already become someone precious to her. She had nodded her head even in the face of imminent danger that had come right up to her.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, Hae-gang reached out with her hand to block her own mouth, which was about to blurt out a positive answer. The conversation came to a halt, and time seemed to slow down in the static silence.</p>
<p>Subjectively, it felt like a long time had passed, but in reality, it was just a minute or so. The words that finally came out were inadequate and pathetic.</p>
<p>“I’ll consider it.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>A faint smile appeared on Woo-jin’s lips, as if he were satisfied with just that. But Hae-gang couldn’t bring herself to smile back at him.</p>
<p>Is it really okay for me to follow this person into the depths of uncertainty? I’m not even sure if the pounding in my chest right now is excitement or unease.</p>
<p>Once again, Sun-woo’s voice, which had been repeated many times before, stirred up confusion in Hae-gang’s mind.</p>
<p>‘I still have to be cautious around my sister-in-law.’</p>
<p>The smile on Woo-jin’s face before her and Sun-woo’s voice, seemingly joyful but never friendly, alternated and caused turmoil within her. Hae-gang’s memories, which had been wandering for a long time, suddenly returned to two years ago, just before the plane crash.</p>
<p>“That day” was the day Hae-gang visited Sun-woo’s house, the day she witnessed him killing his wife with his own hands.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>On that day, Hae-gang went to Sun-woo’s house at the invitation of Dong-seo’s wife, Seo-young. Seo-young was the only person she felt comfortable with among the in-laws, excluding Geonho.</p>
<p>In Hae-gang’s hand was a high-quality handmade cake, which she was sure would please Seo-young, as they had often eaten it together before.</p>
<p>“Ta-da!”</p>
<p>As she lifted the cake up to eye level, just as busy as opening the front door, Seo-young’s face lit up with the happiest expression.</p>
<p>“Oh my! Have you been to this house?”</p>
<p>“Dong-seo loves this. A rich cheesecake. I didn’t pre-order, so it was the last one today. I quickly brought it.”</p>
<p>“Such thoughtfulness. If Sun-woo had some of this thoughtfulness, how nice would it be?”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. Our house’s men aren’t much different either. Maybe our father taught them well in business, but in the realm of dating, it’s a failure.”</p>
<p>“I completely agree.”</p>
