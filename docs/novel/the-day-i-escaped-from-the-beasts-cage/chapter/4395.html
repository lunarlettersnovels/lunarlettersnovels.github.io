        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“Relax and take a breath.”</p>
<p>He wants to do the same. Overwhelmed by the pressure filling her body, Hae-gang tightly closed her eyes. She knew she needed to breathe, but even that became a stimulus, causing her to delay it.</p>
<p>When Hae-gang only trembled her lips and didn’t breathe properly, Woo-jin pressed his lips against hers once again. In pursuit of the warm sensation that sought to draw out his own breath, his airway suddenly opened.</p>
<p>“Ah! Haak!”</p>
<p>Accompanied by short, fragmented breaths, Hae-gang’s chest rose and fell. Beads of sweat appeared on Woo-jin’s forehead, which had remained motionless for a long time. Despite the difficult task at hand, he not only patiently waited but also soothed her, pressing his lips against various parts of her body.</p>
<p>Chest, collarbone, shoulder, waist. Wherever his lips touched, a scorching heat spread as if burning.</p>
<p>Tears that had filled her eyes flowed sideways, and when Hae-gang saw him in her clear vision, she nodded ever so slightly. And as if truly waiting for her permission, Woo-jin began to move his hips.</p>
<p>“Ah, uh.”</p>
<p>The provocative sound of their bodies colliding dispersed along with Hae-gang’s gasps. Every time Woo-jin moved, his grasping hand tightened. It was stimulating enough on its own, but he didn’t even consider my circumstances.</p>
<p>Twisting her body in response to his relentless movements, as if seeking compensation for the waiting time, Hae-gang contorted. His member mercilessly stroked her heightened sensitivity, repeatedly entering and penetrating her fiercely.</p>
<p>With a sensation that filled her insides urgently, her whole body tingled as if electric currents were flowing. Hae-gang wrapped her arms tightly around Woo-jin’s shoulders, embracing him with all her strength.</p>
<p>“Ah… Haak!”</p>
<p>As Hae-gang reached her climax first, her strength seemed to dissipate. However, Woo-jin didn’t seem satisfied yet. Instead, he moved with even more weight, as if willingly accepting her relaxed body.</p>
<p>Intense and almost unbearable sensations continued to pour out one after another. If there was a limit to how much her body could endure, it seemed like she hadn’t reached that threshold. With a hazy mind clouded by heat, all she could think of was that extent.</p>
<p>She tried her best to keep up, but her stamina was inferior to others, already reached its limit. Hae-gang pushed Woo-jin’s chest away with her free hand. Then a languid laugh resonated in her ear.</p>
<p>“Should we stop?”</p>
<p>It was a statement that didn’t match the voice that had longed so passionately. In her heart, she wanted to say yes and stop immediately, but she knew that stopping like this would be more agonizing, so she shook her head horizontally.</p>
<p>“That’s not it, ah!”</p>
<p>In an instant, as Woo-jin penetrated her deeply, Hae-gang’s head jerked back. With her hand that had been pushing his chest, she barely managed to raise it and rest it on his neck.</p>
<p>“Please, please, slow down.”</p>
<p>Feeling Hae-gang’s breath, which seemed like it could give out at any moment, Woo-jin thrust one final time, unable to resist any longer.</p>
<p>“Ah! Uh, heh.”</p>
<p>To keep her senses intact, Hae-gang clenched her teeth and followed his movements. Just as her eyes were beginning to blur, Woo-jin, who had reached his climax, tightly pulled her head towards him. Underneath, Hae-gang’s body also trembled.</p>
<p>The second climax that came was much longer and more agonizing than the first.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>After taking a shower, while he moved me to the bed and carefully covered me with the blanket, Woo-jin stood there with only a loose robe hanging on him.</p>
<p>Water droplets that I hadn’t wiped off trickled down along his sturdy body, glimpsed through the gaps of the robe. The sight overlapped perfectly with the droplets of sweat he had shed earlier.</p>
<p>Ignoring the scorching heat enveloping my body, I avoided looking and threw the towel I had used to dry my hair into the basket. Woo-jin approached as I did so.</p>
<p>“Han Dawn.”</p>
<p>Turning her head in response to the calling voice, Hae-gang’s gaze was momentarily captivated by her face, which shone particularly under the lights.</p>
<p>As she sat up, a pillow was placed behind her back. Hae-gang leaned on it without refusing the kindness, indicating that she was ready to listen, and looked up at him.</p>
<p>Woo-jin hesitated for a moment, seemingly reluctant to respond, but then casually parted his lips as if it were all just his imagination.</p>
<p>“Do you have something to hide from me regarding Yoon Sun-woo?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing his words, Hae-gang’s pupils shook uneasily.</p>
<p>“Why suddenly? What is it?”</p>
<p>“No matter how I think about it, your reaction towards him is excessive. If it were me, I would hold hands with Yoon Sun-woo and drop Yoon Geon-ho into the abyss.”</p>
<p>Nonsense. Who considers a murderer a partner? It’s impossible for someone in their right mind.</p>
<p>Hae-gang half-opened her lips and then closed them again. In order to make Woo-jin understand, she had to bring up past events. But if she were to say it…</p>
<p>“I need to find another hostage, what about Representative Min?”</p>
<p>“I still need to be careful around my sister-in-law.”</p>
<p>The words she heard from Sun-woo earlier kept repeating themselves in her mind countless times.</p>
