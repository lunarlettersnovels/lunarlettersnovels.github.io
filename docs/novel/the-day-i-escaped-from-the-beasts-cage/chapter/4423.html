            <p>“Min Woo Jin seems to have a strong addiction to caffeine,” Hae-gang observed.</p>
<p>Woo-jin corrected him, “Half of modern people are caffeine addicts.”</p>
<p>Lost in thought, Hae-gang stared at her slender arms, wondering how long she could last. The weight of her past was exhausting, forcing her to battle depression and anxiety. The effort to overcome negative emotions was taking a toll on her.</p>
<p>In an effort to dispel the subdued feeling, she took a deep breath and shook her shoulders. She then picked up two bikinis, one in each hand, and looked at Woo-jin.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s sexy,” Woo-jin said, causing Hae-gang’s eyebrows to furrow.</p>
<p>He knew that Dawn Han would have to live her entire life away from him unless things changed. He was always trying to figure out who she was, hiding in the dark and trembling with anxiety whenever there was a new encounter. The mere mention of a member of the Moon Ik family made him sick, as it did the other night.</p>
<p>The thought of it wasn’t very pleasant. Woo-jin’s mouth, hidden behind his cup, closed neatly, and his eyes were focused on Hae-gang.</p>
<p>“I think we should just solve this quickly.”</p>
<p>“What? What did you say?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s eyes widened, perhaps because she could hear his voice from where she was. Woo-jin shook his head, thinking she had misheard him.</p>
<p>“No, keep doing what you’re doing. I don’t think I can leave by tomorrow anyway.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be over soon. Woo-jin, are you sure you have everything you need? The sun is quite strong there, do you have enough sunscreen?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang shook her head excitedly as she saw his small bag already placed in front of the door.</p>
<p>“You’re not taking much with you. It’s not like you’re going to be away for long anyway.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s stiff expression loosened, and he chuckled. Who would have thought she would say that?</p>
<p>He watched as Hae-gang climbed the stairs with a light step. One day, he wouldn’t be able to see her like that anymore. For now, she talked and laughed a lot. Sometimes, he could see the things he used to like about her.</p>
<p>“It’s sad,” he thought.</p>
<p>As he placed the cold coffee in the sink and returned to the living room, he heard Hae-gang descending the stairs with her hair flying in the air. Woo-jin frowned slightly at the sight.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>“And then you stumble.”</p>
<p>As she came down the stairs with an armful of cosmetics, she accidentally spilled them all over the clothes in her carrier. She then gave him a fierce look.</p>
<p>“See? I told you it would be over soon, right?”</p>
<p>She nodded happily as if she had accomplished something great. As her vigilant appearance increased, he couldn’t help but feel rewarded. But then Woo-jin realized that it was rude to treat her like that and quickly changed his mind. After all, she was the one who would be most concerned about being in someone’s possession.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who was watching Hae-gang’s one-man show with interest, said with a hint of relief, “Let’s go to bed now. I have to leave tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>With a whimper and her large carrier placed next to his small one, Hae-gang headed to the bedroom with light steps. The sound of her small humming above filled him with a sense of contentment that should last until they boarded the plane tomorrow.</p>
<p>For the first few days, she was timid every time she lay down, but today she dug into the bed without hesitation to make sure he didn’t fall off. Watching the wriggling woman in his bed filled him with a strange satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Ms. Han Dawn.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Three years…”</p>
<p><em>Wouldn’t it be safest to have her next to me in three years? </em>Woojin shook his head, unable to express what was on his mind.</p>
<p>It was a big deal, and his head was already looking for a way to keep Hae-gang next to him. What came to mind right now was something a little dangerous.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Wearing sunglasses that covered half of her face, Hae-gang looked up at Woo-jin’s private jet, which showed off its presence in front of them. Although it was not as big as Airia’s plane, it was still an impressive aircraft.</p>
<p>Woo-jin had been watching Hae-gang since the moment the private plane came into view, and he couldn’t help but reach out and grab her hand. The wait had been long.</p>
