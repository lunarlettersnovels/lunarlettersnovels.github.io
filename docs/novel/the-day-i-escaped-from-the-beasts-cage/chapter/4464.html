            <p>The man shook his head lightly to shake off his ridiculous thoughts and sighed. He shouldn’t have rushed, despite his busy schedule. He had planned to go to work early to review the reports to be discussed in the meeting, but it seemed that the meeting had to be postponed.</p>
<p>He looked down again at the woman he was holding as he approached his car. The weight he felt on his arms was so light that he frowned. This woman must have starved for days.</p>
<p>After carefully positioning Hae-gang inside in the passenger seat, the man started the car.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Hae-gang lifted her heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>The space around her was quiet and serene. Sunlight gently invaded the gaps in the curtains, and she could feel the softness of the bed underneath her. Everything was all too familiar; as if nothing had happened overnight. Hae-gang felt all the blood drain from her body.</p>
<p>Panicked, Hae-gang jumped up and looked around. Only then could she notice the differences one by one.</p>
<p>The quiet but audible sound of speech. The soft but squeaky medical bed. Blinds instead of thin lace curtains. And most of all, the tingling pain in her arm was evidence of her escape.</p>
<p>Hae-gang lowered her gaze and looked at herself. She was wearing a white gown with a cast arm. Her eyes widened as she read the letters printed in a certain pattern on her clothing.</p>
<p>“Hospital?”</p>
<p><em>Oh, no. If I stay here, he’ll find out.</em></p>
<p>She was a fool to believe the man’s words that he wouldn’t take her to the hospital. Feeling nervous, she planned to escape barefoot. Just as she was about to bolt out, the door to her room gently opened, and a middle-aged doctor entered.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re awake.”</p>
<p>The anxious eyes of Hae-gang followed the doctor’s movements. The doctor, who noticed her defensive behavior, stood at a distance and smiled kindly.</p>
<p>“CEO Min brought the patient here. Do you remember?”</p>
<p>“CEO Min…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I mean CEO Min Woo-jin.”</p>
<p>She guessed it was the name of the driver whose car had crashed into her at dawn. It was familiar as if she had heard it somewhere.</p>
<p>Guessing from his title, he seemed to be running a business. Hae-gang could not ignore the possibility that this man was connected to ‘him’. Anxiety crept into her again; this time, stronger.</p>
<p>“Your arm is fractured, so if you rest, it will heal on its own. In the meantime, it’s better to wear a cast. It doesn’t matter if you wash it, but be careful not to get it sprained,” said the doctor.</p>
<p>But his calm, explaining voice couldn’t penetrate her ears. Hae-gang wanted him out of there as soon as possible. That way, she can escape.</p>
<p>But things never worked out the way she wanted them to. The doctor, who was just about to leave, let out a sigh as if he remembered something he had forgotten.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, we have not yet confirmed the identity of the patient. What is your name?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang, who had been waiting for him to leave, stiffened. On her behalf, since she couldn’t easily reveal her name, someone else’s answer came in through the door.</p>
<p>“I don’t know that yet, Deputy Chief.”</p>
<p>When the voice broke into the conversation, the doctor turned his head to hear what was being said.</p>
<p>“You came early; I heard you had a meeting,” replied the doctor.</p>
<p>“It was such a mess that everything had to be done from scratch again. Thank you for your efforts. You can leave now.”</p>
<p>The doctor left without further questioning the man’s greeting. The man approached Hae-gang and studied her with a sharp gaze.</p>
<p>Hae-gang, who came face to face with him, could not shake off the idea that the man’s face was also familiar.</p>
<p>“I’m Min Woo-jin. What about you?”</p>
<p>Her memories came flooding back when she heard the name.</p>
<p><em>“CEO of Charlie Inc., this is Min Woo Jin.”</em></p>
<p>Hae-gang finally realized; this man appeared in the news on occasion. The voice she always heard on the television belonged to the man right in front of her. He was a threat to her, too.</p>
<p>“You had nothing to verify your identity, so please let me know if you have the contact information of your family or relatives,” said Woo-jin.</p>
<p>The unexpected identity of the man quickly swept through Hae-gang’s head.</p>
<p>Charlie Inc. the fastest-growing company in Korea for nearly five years.</p>
<p>It started as a small entertainment business, but after changing its name to Charlie and entering the content business in earnest, there was no place they could not reach.</p>
<p>Ordinary companies also have several affiliates, but no company has completely monopolized one sector. There are five TV channels operated by Charlie, ranging from movie theaters, bakeries, and restaurants. In the field of culture, no company surpassed Charlie.</p>
