            <p>It was just a fleeting encounter in her short life, but Hae-gang’s presence was felt throughout the ceremony after their brief meeting. She was the one who taught him about love and the importance of letting go. Though she disappeared quickly, her memory remained deeply rooted in his heart like a blossoming flower.</p>
<p>Although time has passed and her face has become blurred, he remembers how lively and radiant she was. To him, Hae-gang was like a shining star that he could not forget.</p>
<p>Despite his deep regret for not being able to see her again with a pure heart, the reality was that she had already passed away. He even failed to recognize her when she was alive, and to her, he was just another stranger.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter how much impact he had on her, what mattered was his foolishness. “There must have been something written in his eyes,” a voice filled with sorrow broke the silence.</p>
<p>How could he fail to recognize the woman he had liked for so long, regardless of his mood? He never questioned it before, but now he realized how stupid he was. He couldn’t even laugh at himself for his lack of awareness.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he was infatuated with Seo Hae-gang, nor was he heartbroken to the point of disrupting his daily life. However, she had stirred up a range of emotions within him, which he found pathetic at the time.</p>
<p>Woo-jin opened the bottle of liquor on the table, wondering why someone would send such a strong drink to someone who couldn’t handle it. At the time, he thought it was thoughtless, but he welcomed it when he needed it the most.</p>
<p>“Who are you running away from?” he asked.</p>
<p>“My husband,” Hae-gang replied.</p>
<p>Her husband was a powerful man who owned Moon Ik, Korea’s leading company, and had envied Woo-jin for liking Hae-gang. He couldn’t comprehend why someone would turn a living person into a dead one, it was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>As he poured the drink into a heavy glass, he furrowed his brow in thought. What made Hae-gang run away so desperately? Why was she out on a cold morning in such light clothing?</p>
<p>Woo-jin could easily find the answers.</p>
<p>“That son of a…”</p>
<p>The animal enclosure. Was it once used to confine wild beasts? A disgusted and angry voice erupted in the dining room before fading into silence. The glass thudded against the table, creating a dull sound.</p>
<p>All the suspicious elements have fallen into place. Hae-gang was locked away in a specific location, and everyone accepted the excuse that she did not appear due to her death.</p>
<p>The only time all of this could have been manipulated was when the plane crashed two years ago.</p>
<p>“Ugh,”</p>
<p>It had been two years since that tragic day.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s troubled thoughts centered on the marks on Hae-gang’s wrist, evidence of her desperate attempts to escape. He stood up, no longer interested in wasting time being angry at the culprit. Instead, he needed to focus on finding a way to liberate Hae-gang.</p>
<p>“I need to get her out of the hospital and send her somewhere safe. Somewhere like…”</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s face twisted in anger for a moment before quickly returning to its original stoic expression.</p>
<p>********</p>
<p>“Have you thought about what you want to do with your life?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s abrupt question caught Hae-gang off guard. She had expected him to enter with a somber tone, but his words were anything but.</p>
<p>Earlier that morning, Hae-gang’s cast had been removed, and she couldn’t help but stare at her bare arm. He was the only person besides “him” who knew her secrets, so she felt there was no reason to hide anything from him.</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to figure it out, but I’m at a loss,” she admitted honestly.</p>
<p>Woo-jin pulled up a chair beside her bed and gazed at her intensely. She tried to avert her eyes from his piercing gaze, but then he said something unexpected.</p>
<p>“I’m going to help you figure out how to live your life.”</p>
