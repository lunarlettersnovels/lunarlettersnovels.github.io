            <p>Woo-jin deliberately glanced at his watch, and Sun-woo didn’t miss it.</p>
<p>“Are you free for the next round? I’ve been keeping this busy man busy for quite some time,” Sun-woo inquired.</p>
<p>“Although I don’t have any pressing engagements, it discomfits me somewhat when my wife eats alone. It’s the first time since we got married,” Woojin confessed.</p>
<p>It was a blatant lie. There had been countless days when Woo-jin was swamped with work and Hae-gang had to have dinner alone. They rarely ate together.</p>
<p>However, Sun-woo was unaware of this, so it wouldn’t hurt for Hae-gang to play along a little.</p>
<p>“Haha, you’re truly devoted to your wife.”</p>
<p>“I can’t compete with CEO Yoon in that department.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin uttered the words with a hint of disdain, observing the crack that appeared on Sun-woo’s composed face.</p>
<p>There was an article that came out every time his wife’s death was mentioned. It portrayed Sun-woo as a grieving husband, visiting his wife’s urn at the charnel house.</p>
<p>The article highlighted his tall stature, immaculate appearance, and gentle love for his wife, enhancing Moon Ik’s public image periodically.</p>
<p>As he looked at Sun-woo’s face, which showed a subtle change in expression, Woo-jin masked his disdain with a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>“I suppose that’s an admirable quality.”</p>
<p>“No, the article exaggerates a lot. My wife-”</p>
<p>Sun-woo’s face was clouded with sorrow. His slightly furrowed eyebrows gave away his distress.</p>
<p>“I believe it was just a tragic accident. It brought me some comfort as well.”</p>
<p>an unfortunate accident. Can we really call it an accident?</p>
<p>Woo-jin couldn’t help but recall Hae-gang’s reaction on the day he made the call. She had scoffed as if she had heard something absurd, surprising him with her blatant response.</p>
<p>Returning his gaze to Sun-woo after a moment of distraction, Woo-jin realized that Sun-woo had been silent for a while.</p>
<p>“That year, after my wife and sister-in-law passed away, the atmosphere at home was strained. The media didn’t paint a pleasant picture back then.”</p>
<p>“I’m aware. The Tragedy of Moon-Ik was widely talked about.”</p>
<p>Speculations had arisen about whether Chairman Yoon, whom both daughters-in-law disliked, had killed them both, and whether the other passengers of AL-701 were also victims of Moon Ik’s severe marital issues.</p>
<p>It had garnered significant attention as it involved the private life of one of the country’s top conglomerates.</p>
<p>“It was inevitable. Thank you for your understanding.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it. It’s been two years, and I can say this now.”</p>
<p>The remark hung in the air, creating an awkward silence at the table. Sun-woo broke the tension with an apologetic tone.</p>
<p>“Oh, my apologies for ruining the mood with such talk.”</p>
<p>“No, I brought it up first, so please don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate your understanding.”</p>
<p>“Shall we leave then?”</p>
<p>There was nothing more to gain from this conversation. Sun-woo must have obtained the answers he sought. After all, Woo-jin was here to convince him in the first place.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who retrieved the coat he had left with the staff, let out a sigh, his mind seemingly occupied by a newfound idea. “Ah, it just occurred to me,” he began, “I have lunch with CEO Yoon Gun-ho next week. He contacted me through the secretary’s office.”</p>
<p>“Gun-ho and CEO Min. That’s going to be an uncomfortable encounter,” remarked Sun-woo.</p>
<p>“Why do you say that?” Woo-jin inquired.</p>
<p>“Today, CEO Min was like that,” his companion gestured vaguely, “and I’m not one for idle chatter. My older brother can be quite particular. I hope I don’t have to apologize to CEO Min again.”</p>
<p>As they stepped outside, a gust of wind greeted them. Woo-jin donned the coat he was carrying and extended his hand. “Then, take care as you go inside, Mr. Yoon.”</p>
<p>“CEO Min as well,” Sun-woo responded.</p>
<p>After exchanging pleasantries with Woo-jin, Sun-woo’s smile vanished as he entered the waiting car.</p>
<p>“You cheeky bastard,” he seethed inwardly.</p>
<p><em>How dare you speak of him in front of me?</em></p>
<p>His fingers twitched with restrained anger, and for the first time in a long while, he felt an urge to kill. He looked at Woo-jin with an emotionless façade, pretending not to know anything.</p>
<p>The driver in the front seat studied Sun-woo’s expression in the rearview mirror and spoke calmly, “Shall we depart?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” Sun-woo replied, quickly masking his annoyance and gazing out of the window as he organized his thoughts.</p>
<p>Sun-woo couldn’t shake off the feeling that Woo-jin was deliberately toying with him, dropping subtle hints without directly revealing his true motives. It was infuriating and intriguing at the same time. He couldn’t deny the fact that Woo-jin had always been one step ahead of him, his actions carefully calculated to keep Sun-woo off balance.</p>
<p>As they drove through the city streets, Sun-woo couldn’t help but mull over Woo-jin’s words and actions. He was sure that Woo-jin was hiding something, and the thought gnawed at him. The way Woo-jin mentioned his lunch appointment with CEO Yoon Gun-ho was no coincidence. It was a clear message to Sun-woo, a challenge to act swiftly and decisively.</p>
<p>Sun-woo clenched his fists, his resolve hardening. He wouldn’t let Woo-jin outmaneuver him again. He would find out what Woo-jin was hiding, and he would confront him head-on. The tension between them was palpable, and Sun-woo was determined to unravel the mystery that was Min Woo-jin. He couldn’t afford to be complacent, not when Woo-jin was always one step ahead. The game was on, and Sun-woo was ready to play.</p>
