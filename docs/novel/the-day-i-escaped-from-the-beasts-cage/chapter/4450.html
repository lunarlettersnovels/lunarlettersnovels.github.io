        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin stared blankly at the crown of his skull, which abruptly dug a hole between him and the man. The initial image of unconsciousness was “a bouncy woman,” but after he realized what had happened, he concluded that she was a “nosey woman.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What exactly are you?” “I cannot determine where you fit as a female.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seoga Media Seo Hae-gang.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A woman’s words were potent because the mouths of all the males who were speaking loudly to introduce themselves were closed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not the Seoga Media preceding the name that calmed them. It may be a well-known mid-sized publishing house, but this is not enough to exercise influence among the chaebol’s offspring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps it was her name, Seo Hae-gang, that made her approach so terrifying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be precise, it will be the Seo Hae-gang-affiliated Moon Ik Group. There are rumors that she will marry a child of Moon Ik, who controls the country’s economy, next spring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary character of the rumor, a 23-year-old woman, was staring at the men with a disapproving grimace on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I owe you money, I tried to make you feel as happy as possible, but you spoiled everything. Let’s hear your justification. Why are you so impolite?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she reprimanded the boys, their faces turned red. Among them, the man who was trying to pick a fight with Woo-jin again lost his fury and approached her, but fortunately, there was a dry hand this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your plans for addressing the situation?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Release him. It’s like a young man talking while relying on his posterior! So you’ll simply wait and see? This is a really bad habit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you completely insane?” Wake up. “This woman’s back is Moon Ik.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin turned his head because he was bored of seeing them become upset and interrupt one another. He believes he treated the actor like a beggar, yet he made friends to save his life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the person who couldn’t ignore what his friends said was pulled out of his seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman, who turned to him only after they had disappeared from view, asked with her eyes drooping in concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin was able to nod his head because he had not been struck and their comments did not cause him significant pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s acceptable. In addition, do I owe you anything?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not that way; by the way, I am Hae-gang.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A woman who introduced herself did not require a grin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a little embarrassing to be in debt, but it’s my fault.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She indicated with her white, lengthened fingers his hand, which had become perfectly sticky after drying off. Woo-jin finally realized she had spilled wine on him earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He rubbed his wine-stained hands together and grimaced. When he was confronted by males who were antagonistic toward him, he initially forgot about it, but after he realized it, he couldn’t wait to wash up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman removed a handkerchief from her small clutch and extended it toward him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t believe it will be of much use, but would you like to wipe it down first?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve had enough. I am free to wash up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin winked at the restroom behind him and declined access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman appeared somewhat humiliated by the abrupt rejection, but there was no time for her to be concerned. He went into the bathroom with the plan of getting his hands and head dirtier as he went.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After washing his hands with water, he feels at rest. Woo-jin, who wiped his hands with a hand towel, exited the restroom with his crooked tie straightened because he had previously been grabbed by the collar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he turned his head in response to the sound of his name being called, Hae-gang, who was sitting on the terrace where the guys had been smoking, made a loud gesture. Woo-jin surveyed the party and then turned to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you have a great deal of free time?” “Would you like to create a counseling center?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin’s eyebrows were raised slightly in an inappropriately personal tone. He inquired, cocking his head as if he did not comprehend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aside from my ideas, do you typically offer counsel to new acquaintances about their concerns?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes it’s more comfortable for someone who doesn’t know his circumstances to speak in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one in this room has a reputation for being a modern-day Cinderella.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fact that Seoga Media was not narrow, it was a little store in comparison to Moon Ik. This indicates that Moon Ik is a massive business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang extended its hand in his direction. He believed she was going to shake his hand, but he could not be sure because her palm was up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I desire to sit here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As he examines it without holding it,” he says while glancing at the railing. The intentions conveyed within were quite clear. The request will likely demand that he approve it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the words of concern, he has been wondering whether it is good. It was improper to reject her, so he held her hand and encouraged her so that she could easily ascend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One, two.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang, who was counting, sprang and sat on a large terrace railing. Again, Woo-jin’s eyes were drawn to the party hall, but that was it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not wish to return to the location where his name was misspelled, so he leaned properly on the railing.</span></p>
