            <p>Woo-jin gazed at Hae-gang’s peaceful face, her eyelids drooping as if she had fallen into a deep slumber. He rolled over, lying on his side, to get a closer look at her delicate features. His eyes scanned over her round forehead, the bridge of her nose, and her pale cheeks, which had been cooled by the air conditioner. His mind flooded with memories of the previous night, and he let out a soft sigh. Ever since he touched her, his desire for her has grown stronger.</p>
<p>He knew he should get up and attend to his responsibilities, but he felt like he could collapse at any moment. Just then, his phone lit up with a bright screen, and he was grateful that he had set it to silent before coming to the island. Woo-jin adjusted the air conditioner’s temperature using the remote control next to his phone and left the room quietly. As he stepped out, the sweltering heat hit him, but he was relieved that the phone call had not disconnected.</p>
<p>“CEO, are you available on the phone now?” His secretary’s voice sounded in his ear.</p>
<p>Woo-jin responded, “Tell me.”</p>
<p>“Moon-Ik has requested a meeting.”</p>
<p>He remembered the conversation he had with Sun-woo before coming to the island. Sun-woo had warned him about Moon Ik’s impatience. Woo-jin’s eyebrows rose as his secretary continued speaking.</p>
<p>“The President of Moon-Ik Motors, Gunho Yoon, has also requested a meeting. They both want to see you as soon as possible. Which one should I schedule first?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin sat on a sunbed and gazed at the sea as the sun began to set. It reminded him of the beach he had visited with Hae-gang before their marriage. On that night, Hae-gang had been searching for the horizon in the darkness, trying to find a way to release her pent-up anger toward herself and her husband.</p>
<p>He thought about the situation warmly. Though he had hoped to resolve the issue in some way, the fact that both Sun-Woo and Gun-ho wanted to meet with him was a good sign. It would provide him with more options to help Hae-gang.</p>
<p>“I’ll meet with President Sun-Woo Yoon first,” Woo-jin said, making his decision. He needed to know what Sun-Woo had done to make Hae-gang so afraid.</p>
<p>After ending the call, Woo-jin returned to the room and sat on the bed. Hae-gang was still asleep, her face peaceful as she breathed softly. He pushed her hair back, feeling a knot form in his stomach.</p>
<p>“What should I do with you?” he whispered to her. “I need to put someone in front of you. I hope you won’t think badly of me and hold on well.”</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>As Hae-gang slowly opened her eyes to the streaming sunlight, the vast expanse of the cool ocean lay before her. It had been four days since her arrival at this exquisite resort. From the comfort of her bed, she looked out, her upper body raised and saw Woo-jin engrossed in conversation against the picturesque backdrop. She got out of bed, roughly tying her messy hair into a knot, and stepped out into the morning light. The person talking to Woo-jin caught sight of her and waved his hand.</p>
<p>“Good morning, DAWN!”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Coral.”</p>
<p>Each resort on the island had its own personal manager, and the male manager, who introduced himself as Coral, greeted her with energetic enthusiasm every time he saw her. He had asked her to call him by his name, which means pretty, and Woo-jin had nicknamed him Min. Initially, his excessive energy had been overwhelming, and she avoided his company, but over time, she had grown accustomed to his presence. After exchanging a few words with him about the day’s schedule, Woo-jin turned to face her.</p>
<p>“Today, let’s take it easy and relax at the resort. How about catching a movie on the beach in the evening?”</p>
<p>“Sounds great.”</p>
<p>The last three days had been filled with active activities such as snorkeling, leaving her body feeling swollen and sore from all the time spent in the water. Resting her body today seemed like the perfect plan if she wanted to catch her flight tomorrow. As Coral waved his arms in their direction from the boat, Hae-gang eagerly waved back, but Woo-jin seemed hesitant to acknowledge him. Eventually, she followed Woo-jin as he moved away.</p>
<p>“What’s on your agenda for today, Min Woo-jin?”</p>
<p>“Nothing much. I haven’t been sleeping well the past few nights.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang was confused by his response. Hae-gang herself was a light sleeper, always on the alert for any movement around her. However, there was nothing here to cause offense. She lost her curiosity and asked.</p>
<p>“Why? Is the bed uncomfortable?”</p>
<p>This was one of the top five high-end resorts in the Maldives, and not a single piece of furniture or equipment had been overlooked in its design, including the bed. She thought of various reasons, but she couldn’t figure out why he couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p>“It’s something you don’t need to worry about.”</p>
