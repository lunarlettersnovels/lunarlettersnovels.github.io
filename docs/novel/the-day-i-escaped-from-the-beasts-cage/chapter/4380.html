        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How faithfully would the mask covering his face perform its role? Hae-gang, feeling uneasy even before reaching the venue, fumbled with the mask several times. Her heart raced so much that she felt she could vomit through her throat.</p>
<p>“Ms. Seo Hae-gang.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“What if you answer? You shouldn’t react to that name.”</p>
<p>She nodded obediently at the very correct words. Don’t react to Seo Hae-gang’s name. She repeated it in her mind several times to remember, eventually letting out a sigh. While she understood it in her mind, she wasn’t sure if she could handle the situation well in reality.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, she tried to touch her eyes, but was blocked by the mask on her face. Her hand, powerless to achieve what she wanted, fell weakly onto her lap.</p>
<p>“We have arrived.”</p>
<p>At the announcement from the driver up front, Hae-gang took a deep breath. Woo-jin, who had gotten out of the car first through the door opened by the valet, extended his hand. Hae-gang’s hand, which was desperately reaching out without any destination, grabbed his.</p>
<p>Bending down to align their eye levels inside the car, Woo-jin spoke with a firm and gentle voice, “I’m sorry for bringing you into this situation. But remember, regardless of who you meet here, no matter what rumors may circulate, what Han Dawn should do remains the same as last time.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s eyes behind the shaking mask met Woo-jin’s eyes, also hidden behind the mask. Despite more than half of his face being covered, he seemed even more emotionless than usual due to the mask. However, his tone was affectionate and kind.</p>
<p>“Even if I’m not by your side, don’t get caught and just run away well. Whatever responsibility comes next, I’ll take care of it.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang nodded several times, absorbing every word he said. He was a man of action. Although the process sometimes deviated from the direction she desired, there was no reason not to trust him.</p>
<p>Hae-gang tightened her grip on Woo-jin’s hand and took a step out. The moment she entered the venue, she felt a mixture of tension and relief.</p>
<p>The mask was more effective than she had thought. Without directly hearing the other person’s voice and manner of speaking, it would be quite challenging to deduce who they were. Of course, if the relationship was truly intimate, she might recognize them at a glance, but fortunately, there was no such person for Hae-gang except for one—Yoon Geon-ho.</p>
<p>“Sigh.”</p>
<p>The problem lay with her partner. Unlike her, Woo-jin was a very famous figure. With his innate physicality and atmosphere, he captured everyone’s attention as soon as he appeared. The mask didn’t seem to hide his presence, and the words “Charlie” and “Min Woo-jin” could be heard faintly.</p>
<p>“I never expected my obstacle to be Mr. Min Woo-jin.”</p>
<p>She whispered to him, but there was no response. Sneakily looking up, she noticed the stiff posture of Ha-Gwan, seemingly unaware. As a way to ease the steadily building tension, she added a few words.</p>
<p>“Fame that pierces through the mask, huh?”</p>
<p>“I was also quite perplexed. Surprisingly, your concentration is impressive.”</p>
<p>It was unusual for him, who was always thorough and planned. This was true for incidents like the one by the sea a long time ago and for not being very self-aware of his own fame.</p>
<p>Hae-gang rolled her eyes, hidden behind the mask, scanning the expansive space. The fact that Geon-ho could recognize her meant that she, in turn, could identify him. Fortunately, he didn’t seem to have arrived yet. Hae-gang quickly released her fist bump with Woo-jin.</p>
<p>“Being next to Min Woo-jin doesn’t seem like a good idea.”</p>
<p>He silently agreed with her words, nodding slightly. Hae-gang, who had chosen a spot away from Woo-jin, felt uneasy about the distance but soon realized it was the right decision as people began to crowd in. It was at that moment that she watched Woo-jin from a distance with a much-relieved heart.</p>
<p>“Miss Han Dawn?”</p>
<p>A woman in a red dress approached, adorned with a mask featuring a large brim that accentuated her vibrant red lips.</p>
<p>Hae-gang unknowingly tensed, relaxed her stiff shoulders, and smiled as nonchalantly as possible.</p>
<p>“Calling me by name like that might diminish the purpose of wearing a mask.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I was a bit shortsighted. But everyone here probably already knows who you are, don’t they?”</p>
<p>The exaggerated gestures of the woman looking around deliberately caused Hae-gang’s eyebrows beneath the mask to slightly furrow. Nevertheless, her lips maintained their curved shape.</p>
<p>“That’s too unfair. Well, then, why don’t you introduce yourself?”</p>
<p>Even with this somewhat demanding request, the woman responded leisurely.</p>
<p>“Not difficult at all. I’m Lee Seo-jin from TN. It’s an honor to accompany Miss Han Dawn at the ‘Night of Sponsorship’ event.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang lowered the smile that had been hanging on her lips. Although basic etiquette was present in her words, the repetitive use of her name made Hae-gang wonder how to interpret it.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">She wasn’t a frequent face in social circles, but she had grown up under her business tycoon father. It was said that with just a few words of conversation, one could discern whether the other person was favorably disposed or hostile.</p>
<p>While Hae-gang wasn’t sure of this woman’s intentions, she was not without confidence in such verbal skirmishes. After all, she had been the daughter-in-law of the Moon-Ik family for a solid five years.</p>
<p>“Well, the word ‘honor’ doesn’t sound particularly touching to me.”</p>
<p>Probably, her attitude today might establish her as a regular at such gatherings of women in the future. So, it was crucial not to appear dismissive. Later on, she couldn’t afford rumors like “The newcomer at Charlie’s was a bit lacking, but Min Woo-jin doesn’t pick just anyone as his wife.”</p>
<p>“I may not enjoy being in the limelight as much as my reputation suggests.”</p>
<h3>Hae-gang met the eyes of the woman seated at a similar height as hers. A firm yet forceful voice filled the space between them.</h3>
<p>“If you continue drawing attention to me in this manner, it puts me in an awkward position.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps there’s a misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>“No, it seems like this won’t be a long-lasting encounter. I’ll need to discuss with my husband the arrangement with TN after this.”</p>
<p>Releasing the fist she had clenched, she turned her body towards Woo-jin, who was now buried among the crowd. Confidently, she believed that if she told him right now to leave, he wouldn’t refuse.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to use this as an excuse to leave, an apology reached her from behind.</p>
<p>“I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. I hope you enjoy the evening.”</p>
<p>The woman maintained a deliberately kind smile, but she couldn’t entirely conceal the lingering discomfort in her words.</p>
<p>However, as Hae-gang had no intention of undermining her opponent from the beginning and had no reason to engage in a prolonged verbal skirmish, she accepted her apology at this point.</p>
<p>“Please be more careful next time.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Rather than exchanging formal goodbyes, Hae-gang left the conversation with a subtle nod. Her desire not to be in an uncomfortable situation outweighed the regret of leaving the prestigious location where people’s gazes barely reached.</p>
<p>Wandering around the event for a moment, she seized a passing waiter and asked,</p>
<p>“Where is the restroom?”</p>
<p>“If you go out through the entrance and follow the left corridor, you’ll find it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Following his instructions, Hae-gang reached the restroom, occupied one stall, and sighed deeply. How long has it been? She was already tired. Her throat was dry too. She’d have to ask if there were any non-alcoholic beverages when she left.</p>
<p>Taking a brief respite, Hae-gang was about to reach for the doorknob when she overheard a conversation.</p>
<p>“Did you see the woman who came in with President Min Woo-jin earlier? That’s her, right? The rumored wife of President Min.”</p>
<p>The hand about to unlock the door paused. It seemed like she had become the topic of discussion among those present today.</p>
<p>“They said she had a prominent burn scar on her face, but thanks to the mask, she seems to have gained some courage to come all the way here.”</p>
<p>“It looks like she’s talking to that Lee person. Have they ever met?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that? Soo-jin Unnie was eager. After rejecting her, she wanted to at least see who the woman was that Min Woo-jin married.”</p>
<p>Listening quietly, she now understood why that woman had provoked her earlier. It was no wonder there was hostility in her words.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she had no intention of confronting them. It was better to avoid a clash, especially considering she had heard enough. Wondering why they were chatting in the restroom instead of the spacious venue outside, Hae-gang decided to wait a little longer to avoid any unnecessary encounters.</p>
<h3>However, their conversation didn’t conclude as easily as Hae-gang had thought. Checking the watch on her wrist amid the lingering chatter, she felt a sense of urgency, worried that Woo-jin might be searching for her.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>“Which family is she from? Have you heard anything?”</h3>
<p>“Absolutely nothing. Everything is shrouded in mystery except for her name.”</p>
<p>“What’s with the mystery vibe? Is she into mysticism or something?”</p>
<p>Alongside the sound of fixing makeup, the conversation gradually turned more explicit and intrusive.</p>
<p>“How far will she go? She’s not just an ordinary person; she’s associated with Charlie.”</p>
<p>They continued gossiping about her long after. Only now did Hae-gang unlock the door, but she still hadn’t completely washed her hands.</p>
<p>None of their words resonated with her. She wasn’t relaxed enough to take in the chatter of people who didn’t know her. Rather, the thought of leaving before Woo-jin got worried took precedence.</p>
<p>As she stepped out of the restroom, the conversation persisted:</p>
<p>“I found her.”</p>
<p>Beep—In an instant, along with a ringing noise, a hallucination overwhelmed her, and the hair on her body stood on end. Hae-gang instinctively raised a hand to cover her ear.</p>
<p>“I apologize if I made you uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>Where did reality end and the hallucinations begin? She shook her head and looked down at her legs, which had somehow stopped moving.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for bringing you into this situation.”</p>
<p>She touched her ear as if trying to confirm whether the voice was real. Suddenly, she realized she was staring at the floor, where several tissues were scattered.</p>
<p>“Turn back, Seo Hae-gang.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Don’t make me angry.”</p>
<p>A heavily restrained voice, as if holding back something. A voice she had heard incessantly for two years. Her stomach churned. The black tissues transformed into countless hands, crawling stickily up her legs.</p>
<p>“Come here, Hae-gang.”</p>
<p>Even after leaving the hotel, the nightmare that had consistently tormented her was vividly replaying itself.</p>
