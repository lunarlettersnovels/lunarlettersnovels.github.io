            <p>Hae-gang gritted her teeth in defiance. Seon-woo’s face softened slightly, perhaps because of the coffee she had spilled on him earlier. But Hae-gang knew that he was still a monster, devoid of any humanity.</p>
<p>Seon-woo straightened his leg and loomed over her. “I told you to keep your mouth shut about what you saw that day,” he hissed. “Did you promise me?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s eyes sharpened. “I did. And I also asked you why you let that bastard live. If you really wanted to protect Yun Gun-ho, you should have killed him and not me.”</p>
<p>Seon- woo’s face contorted with confusion, clearly not understanding what was being said. But Hae-gang’s eyes bulged with a hint of blood, her voice growing stronger with each passing word.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to kill someone once, but not twice! You said that yourself!”</p>
<p>She paused to catch her breath, her emotions still running high. It was hard to calm down once you got worked up, especially when it came to Yoon Geon-ho, her legal husband, and the man who held her heart. Seon-woo’s threat to kill him had worked, until she woke up in a hotel suite after a plane crash.</p>
<p>Hae-gang regained her composure and shot Seon-woo a cold, angry glare, her eyes containing a hint of pity.</p>
<p>“That’s why I said it. Please, I hope that madman dies at your hands.”</p>
<p>Seon-Woo, unaware of what she was referring to, burst into laughter and stared blankly at Hae-gang below. Hae-gang didn’t back down, continuing to glare at Seon-woo and confronting him.</p>
<p>“Did you really think I’d protect Yoon Geon-ho while locked up in that small hotel? The one who put me there?” she spat.</p>
<p>Seon-woo grabbed Hae-gang by the collar as she screamed, lifting her up so her toes barely touched the ground. She struggled to catch her breath, unable to shake off the feeling of suffocation as Seon-woo spoke.</p>
<p>“There was no need to take that risk. I knew you were alive and well in Rudy. Well, mostly. If we keep secrets from each other, everything will be neatly resolved. You don’t even have to kill him.”</p>
<p>A mean-spirited smile spread across Seon-woo’s face, and Hae-gang gritted her teeth at the mocking tone of his words.</p>
<p>In a flash of contempt, Seon-woo spat out a single word: “Trash.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s eyes bulged with anger and disbelief. How could Seon-woo utter such callous words? It was enough to drive her to the brink of neurosis. She clenched her teeth, simmering with rage that had been building for two long years, locked away from the outside world.</p>
<p>Finally, Hae-gang could no longer contain her emotions, and she let out a piercing scream. “This is insane! Everyone has gone mad!” She shook her arm, trying to throw off the disgust that had taken hold of her.</p>
<p>“He used s*x as a means of protecting me, something I never even asked for?” Hae-gang cried out, her voice shaking with rage. “What kind of person is he?”</p>
<p>Seon-woo’s reply was calm and collected. “That was his sincerity,” he said. “At least Yoon Geon-ho didn’t really kill you.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s grip on Seon-woo’s coat collar tightened. “Explain yourself!” she demanded. “What are you trying to do?”</p>
<p>Seon-woo’s eyes glinted with a cold light. “I know that Yoon Geon-ho is not even worth as much as a dog,” he said. “But I need another hostage, and I wonder how valuable CEO Min Woo-jin might be.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s eyes filled with tears. Even strangers could see the sadness etched on her face. But Seon-woo showed no mercy, speaking in a detached tone as if he felt nothing.</p>
<p>“Of course, killing you would be the quickest way to get what I want,” he continued. “But Yoon Geon-ho won’t stand still.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s heart pounded with fear. Seon-woo was a man who would kill without hesitation. She had seen that firsthand. “It’s hard enough to kill someone once,” she thought to herself. “But twice?”</p>
<p>Seon-woo watched Hae-gang in silence, rubbing his hands together as if to shake off the heat of his words. His expression remained unchanged, even as the pain of the burns on his palms began to set in.</p>
<p>“It looks like my sister-in-law still needs to learn to watch her mouth,” he said with a cruel smile.</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s lips trembled, but no words came out. Tears streamed down her face, and she felt the weight of past misfortunes bearing down on her once again.</p>
