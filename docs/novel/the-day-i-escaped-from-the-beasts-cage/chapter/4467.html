        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang had no idea how long she had passed out. She believed she had awoken once during her sleep, but when she fully opened her eyes, the sun was already high in the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was only one difference between today and yesterday. Hae-gang cast an indifferent glance out the window, as though the world was devoid of color. There was no sense of anticipation or enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘He’ is on a lengthy business trip to Dubai. He won’t be there for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang recalled. ‘He’ was next to her when she awoke in the morning. She remembered what he said as he caressed her sweat-soaked hair as if it were priceless. She was so tired that she couldn’t even swat his hand away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang blinked a few times and noticed something other than the sun’s location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not about finding the incorrect image.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She glanced up at the drip above her head silently. If she looks down, she will see a clear tube through which the drip’s solution runs, and underneath it…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang fixed her gaze on the needle in her arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had failed many times before, but that didn’t mean she couldn’t try again. She yanked the drip needle from her arm without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drops of scarlet blood fell on the white duvet and spread like a flower, but she ignored the pattern her blood had created. Instead, she walked towards the guarded door, holding a little needle about two inches from her skin to keep it from falling. The guard’s attention was drawn to the needle in her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get out,” she yelled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. Please give it to me.” The guard responded obstinately. But Hae-gang was not disappointed because it was expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She lacked the power and stamina to overcome several seemingly impenetrable barriers. Furthermore, reports of disturbances will be delivered to ‘him’ in real time. Is he already on a plane? She didn’t have time to waste if she hadn’t already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang braced her quivering hand that gripped the needle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Move or I’ll die here,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a foreshadowing of what was to come. The guard, who was alternatively glancing at the needle in her hand, was irritated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will cause us problems, lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guard’s statements made Hae-gang laugh. Trouble. This was true of everyone ‘he’ employed. They were all concerned about themselves; whether or not they would lose their employment. Hae-gang thought them were amusing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she implored these folks for a hundred days, they would not change their minds. She’d learnt enough from her previous experiences, and she didn’t expect anything different this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then there’s nothing I can do,” Hae-gang said, shaking her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been two years since she’s been imprisoned in this place with no access to fresh air. Nothing can make her regret her choices anymore. The scars on her wrist were proof. However, a needle-like this would barely pierce her wrists. She was certain she’d see that stupid ceiling again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her thoughts, she heard a voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is none. If you truly want to die, you must choose a more specific location. Let’s get it done before ‘he’ arrives. Let’s see if he won’t even throw your body out this door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it was an extremely thin needle, it was originally designed to dig into human flesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hand that lifted the needle to where the pulse vibrated was not hesitant. Hae-gang was tense. She wasn’t afraid, but for the first time in a long time, she felt happy. She really needed to get out of here somehow, and now was the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-face gang’s lit up with excitement, and an unexpected sound boomed around the room. For the first time since her confinement, she laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the conversation was cut short by a phone call.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t do it. You dislike causing problems for others.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The needle that was going to puncture her skin came to a halt. A frown replaced the curve on her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if it had been a while, it was still too soon to forget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In anguish, Hae-gang bit her lower lip. She recalled a day when it had been a year since she had entered this room: when the new guard had brought along a fruit knife when she had indicated she wanted to eat an apple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day was exactly like today. Hae-gang had made her life collateral, but ‘he’ refused to listen. When ‘he,’ who had been at the company, arrived, she already had another wound on her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—Observe what happens if you do this again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that day, Hae-gang had to see how the new guard placed in front of her was ruined.</span></p>
