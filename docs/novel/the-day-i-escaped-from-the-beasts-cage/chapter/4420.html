            <p>Hae-gang was caught off guard as Woo-jin lightly pressed her chin, parted her lips, and licked her tongue. Helplessly, Hae-gang gave in and grabbed Woo-jin’s shoulder, feeling the heat emanating from all of her skin, including her palms. As they kissed, Woo-jin asked where Hae-gang was feeling it, causing her voice to bounce in the air as she responded. Woo-jin’s hand slipped around Hae-gang’s waist and untied her bikini knot, intensifying the moment. Hae-gang’s head tilted back as the kiss grew more difficult, and Woo-jin ran her hand over Hae-gang’s nape before pulling her closer.</p>
<p>As Woo-jin gently squeezed Hae-gang’s chest, a faint moan escaped their lips once more. Her hand slipped around Woo-jin’s neck, pulling them even closer together. The redness of the sky and Hae-gang’s ears, and flesh heightened the intensity of the moment. Woo-jin was momentarily dazzled by the color, teasing Hae-gang’s ear and lightly rubbing her head. Hae-gang’s breath tickled Woo-jin’s collarbone, and Woo-jin requested that Hae-gang move her hand. Hae-gang responded with confusion, and his languid voice flowed from her lips next to Hae-gang’s ear.</p>
<p>As if molding clay, he played with the skin on his hands. Satisfied with the softness he felt, he held on tight, unwilling to let go.</p>
<p>“Min Woo-jin, stop.” The voice pleading for him to stop turned into one of strange pleasure, following the movements of their bodies. The first heart he had truly desired was gradually changing, but he didn’t know what to do about it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the sound of the trolley wheels outside interrupted them. Woo-jin was restless as if he had heard something alarming. Irritated with the sudden interruption, he clicked his tongue and put the shirt he had taken off over Hae-gang’s head. The wet fabric clung to her body, accentuating the shape of her chest. Woo-jin laughed softly at Hae-gang’s panicked reaction.</p>
<p>“Don’t do that; let’s do this.” He hugged Hae-gang as she was, covering up the parts he didn’t want to see. He could only feel curves separated by a thin cloth.</p>
<p>The arrival of the staff cut short their moment. Woo-jin patted Hae-gang’s back and greeted the staff, instructing them where to put the food they had ordered. As the staff left, Woo-jin finally let go of Hae-gang, who had been hiding her face in Woo-jin’s chest.</p>
<p>She was blushing all over her body like a ripe fruit, with the brightest color on her face.</p>
<p>“Your face is quite nice to see,” he remarked, his eyes dancing mischievously. When his gaze met hers, it was as if they were having a short conversation, just like eight years ago. A smile spread across his face.</p>
<p>“Min Woo-jin looks like he’s having fun,” she observed.</p>
<p>“To be honest, it’s more of a sense of accomplishment than fun,” he admitted. He was proud of himself for slowly gaining Hae-gang’s trust and bringing her out of her shell. It was a remarkable achievement compared to the boundaries set by the hospital, but he knew they still had a long way to go.</p>
<p>“Let’s have dinner before it gets cold,” Woo-jin suggested, slipping his hand inside his T-shirt and retying Hae-gang’s untied bikini string. As he noticed her tensing up at the unexpected invasion, he felt regret that he hadn’t done it earlier. He planted a light kiss on her shoulder, filled with regret.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>He looked at Jaemin, who was standing in front of him with a stiff posture. As he watched, Jaemin’s eyes shifted, revealing a growing sense of unease.</p>
<p>“Boss, what brought me here?” Jaemin started to say.</p>
<p>“Jeong Jae-min,” he cut in, his gaze making Jaemin flinch. After confirming Jae-min’s reaction, he continued.</p>
<p>“How far did you tell about that man?”</p>
<p>Jae-min tilted his head slightly at the question as if it were just another part of their daily routine.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” he asked.</p>
<p>His lips drew a sneer on his expression as if he couldn’t catch the context. Did he not understand, or was he pretending not to? Whatever it was, it was a stupid decision.</p>
<p>With a dismissive gesture, “he” put down the cell phone with the message he received a few days ago. Jae-min’s face went white when he saw the picture on the phone. It was a very clear change.</p>
<p>Jae-min, flustered for a while, quickly kneeled down and stuttered an excuse.</p>
<p>“That, I didn’t mean to, either.”</p>
<p>“Just answer the question. Your fate will be decided based on your answer.”</p>
<p>“Boss, please forgive me just this once. I really didn’t mean to betray you. If you let me go, I’ll take care of my son’s education.”</p>
<p>Jae-min had divorced as quickly as he had gotten married early, and he had a son. Perhaps he was motivated by the desire to provide a better environment for his child.</p>
<p>However, “he” did not have the humanity to feel sympathy for others’ circumstances.</p>
<p>“Is your son turning 4 this year?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes! He just turned 4. He still has a lot of time to grow, so I must have looked away for a while. Sorry, boss!”</p>
<p>“Four years old.”</p>
