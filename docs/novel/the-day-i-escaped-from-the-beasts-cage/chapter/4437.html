            <p>Charlie was a company that had made a name for itself in various industries. Having only a few affiliates five years ago, it had managed to keep pace with the rapidly changing times and had grown exponentially.</p>
<p>“But I can’t believe I posted such a lame plan,” Woo-jin thought as he made his way toward the office, his mind reeling with a mix of thoughts.</p>
<p>But as he got closer, he could hear loud noises coming from inside, and he knew he was about to face the woman who was causing it. Judging from her breathing, the secretary seemed to know who it was.</p>
<p>“Who is it?” Woo-jin asked.</p>
<p>“Well, you know, it’s…” The secretary hesitated, but before she could finish, the woman had already spotted him.</p>
<p>“Min Woo-jin!” she shouted, stomping over to him, her heels clicking against the floor.</p>
<p>As she got closer, Woo-jin tried to get himself together. He gave the still-shocked secretary a small warning look.</p>
<p>“I’m CEO Yoon Ji-woo of Hotel Rudy.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin gave her a disapproving glance. He couldn’t understand why people had to resort to threats when their abilities couldn’t rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>When Ji-woo came in front of him, Woo-jin tried to hold back his anger and greet her as nicely as possible to hide his displeasure.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Yoon-”</p>
<p>“Why do you refuse?” Ji-woo interrupted, her tone impatient and aggressive.</p>
<p>Finding her attitude unprofessional, Woo-jin opened the office door and gestured for her to come in. Inside, he asked the secretary to bring them two cups of tea, offered Ji-woo a seat, and sat across from her. He could feel the fatigue setting in as he sat diagonally on the sofa, crossing his legs.</p>
<p>“Don’t you like me?” Ji-woo asked with a sneer. “Is it because my nose is a bit low?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin knew this kind of attitude and behavior was unacceptable, and he couldn’t let that slide. He had to address this and find a way to work with her despite her bad behavior.</p>
<p>Woo-jin couldn’t understand what Chairman Yoon saw in this woman or why he entrusted her with the hotel business. Her rambling words and lack of courtesy were truly spectacular, and he couldn’t believe he was only a few minutes into the conversation and already feeling exhausted.</p>
<p>After his secretary left the room with the tea, Woo-jin calmly spoke to Ji-woo.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t like CEO Yoon, but I’m already engaged to be married,” he explained, “The news may have been late, but the announcement was made some time ago.”</p>
<p>But Ji-woo was not deterred and responded with a sly grin, “So that means you like me, right?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s hand, lifting the teacup to his mouth, froze. He couldn’t understand how someone could be so positively-minded and only choose to hear the words that benefited them, and this kind of dichotomous thinking was not amusing to him.</p>
<p>Ji-woo’s following words solidified Woo-jin’s belief that she was not the right partner for him and his company.</p>
<p>“The marriage you’re about to have, turn it upside down. I don’t know who she is, but she can’t be a better opponent than me.”</p>
<p>“That’s rude,” Woo-jin responded, staring at her with dry eyes.</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe she was proposing to call off his upcoming marriage and suggest she would be a better fit for him and his business.</p>
<p>Woo-jin stood up from his seat and looked down at Ji-woo indifferently.</p>
<p>“CEO Yoon, I think this is the first time we’ve met, but you’re interfering too much. I’ll only tolerate this behavior this once,” he said, his tone becoming more serious.</p>
<p>“Are you going to stay there?”</p>
<p>Ji-woo’s mouth, which had been excitedly talking with a stern voice, was closed, and she knew she had crossed the line, and it was a clear sign that she would not be welcome again.</p>
