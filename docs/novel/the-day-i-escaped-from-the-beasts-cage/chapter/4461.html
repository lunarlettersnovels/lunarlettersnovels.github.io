            <p>After making sure that Jae-min agreed, “he” walked into Hae-gang’s bedroom with a neutral expression and started looking around. He saw an almost empty coffee cup, a handprint in the middle of a window that looked out over Seoul, a slightly tilted sofa compared to the other seats, and an upside-down remote control sticking out of the cushion. These details gave him insight into Hae-gang’s personality and habits. After scanning the bedroom for a long time, he left the room and issued an order.</p>
<p>“She wouldn’t have been able to go to a hospital or hotel, so she searched for anywhere she could hide, including nearby motels.”</p>
<p>“Well, sir…” His steps came to a halt at Jae-min’s cautious tone. Jae-min prayed that what he was about to say would not further agitate his temper.</p>
<p>“I don’t think your wife took the cash with her.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>His forehead creased in frustration. It didn’t make sense that Hae-gang wouldn’t have taken any cash with her. She was sensitive and needed to be taken care of, but upon further consideration, he realized that she had never spent any money since she rarely left the house.</p>
<p>He clicked his tongue in annoyance. If Hae-gang didn’t have any money with her, she could go nowhere. Hae-gang couldn’t do anything without him.</p>
<p>“Contact the traffic officer in charge and check the CCTV nearby first.” “Quick,” he ordered as he hurried out of the room, his steps driven by anxiety and frustration. It was the first time she had left his sight since the accident.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Hae-gang gasped for breath as she ran on the snow-covered ground, her progress slowed by the sound of footsteps behind her. She didn’t want to turn around, knowing that she might not be able to escape the moment she faced him.</p>
<p>“Hae-gang,” his voice called to her, low and firm. His voice softened, but it made no difference.</p>
<p>“Come here, Hae-gang.”</p>
<p>The coldness in his eyes never changed. Hae-gang tried to catch her breath, feeling suffocated even though the only things present were her and the voice that kept calling her name.</p>
<p>Her pace slowed until she eventually came to a stop. Her legs felt heavy, and when she looked down, she saw countless hands grabbing onto her legs as if trying to hold her back. It was as if running away from “him” was futile.</p>
<p>“Please let go of me,” she pleaded; the only solution she could think of was to beg his sympathy. She would have to kneel before him if she couldn’t run away.</p>
<p>Hae-gang was not ashamed to show her desperation. The days she spent in the hotel room was even more humiliating, and every attempt she made to leave had been a failure.</p>
<p>“Stop it, you have done enough, and I have been patient enough,” a low voice said with a laugh, a sound that was unfamiliar to Hae-gang.</p>
<p>She saw a giant hand reaching out toward her in the darkness and was overwhelmed with fear, burying her face in her hands as she broke into tears.</p>
<p>“Calm down,” the voice said. Hae-gang opened her eyes and saw the sky outside the window painted red by the setting sun. As soon as she realized that a hand was holding her shoulder, she smacked it with all her might and scrambled to the corner of the bed, curling her body and burying her face between her knees. Hae-gang stayed in that position, and her sense of reality returned after her heart had calmed down.</p>
<p>She was in a hospital room, and Hae-gang had already escaped prison. Recognizing all the facts, Hae-gang slowly raised her head and saw Woo-jin staring at her in confusion.</p>
<p>“I must have had a dream,” she muttered, though, in reality, it was more of a nightmare than a hopeful dream. Goosebumps erupted on Hae-gang’s skin as she vividly remembered the touch of the hands that had grabbed her.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, recognizing her paranoia, watched her from a distance with narrowed eyes. Feeling uncomfortable with his gaze, Hae-gang defensively asked, “Why are you looking at me like that?”</p>
<p>“What is that?” he asked, pointing at her left wrist. Hae-gang followed his gaze and realized he was pointing at a wound on her wrist.</p>
