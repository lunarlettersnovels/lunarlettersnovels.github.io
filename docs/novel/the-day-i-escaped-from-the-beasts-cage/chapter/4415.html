            <p>Hae-gang extended her hand that was in contact with Woo-jin a little more and wrapped it around his neck, which became an implicit signal.</p>
<p>Woo-jin has tangled his tongue as if he were going to swallow all his breath. Maybe it’s because she drank a sweet drink, but the kiss is especially thick. Thanks to it, her head was already in a mess.</p>
<p>The room was filled with the sweet aroma of mojito, enveloping every corner, even penetrating deep into Hae-gang’s mind. As Woo-jin’s persistent lips finally parted from hers with a light tap on his shoulder, his gaze was fixed on her with a frown, seemingly unsatisfied.</p>
<p>In a slow and sensual move, he bent his neck from side to side, unbuttoning his shirt in a way that exuded an irresistible sexiness. Hae-gang’s senses were all heightened – every sound, every sight, every touch—all focused solely on Woo-jin.</p>
<p>“I hope you’re feeling strong today,” she said, her hands intertwining with his as they pressed against each other. The sensation reminded her of the kiss they shared moments ago.</p>
<p>As Woo-jin’s hands moved slowly and deliberately, his eyes betraying his drunken state, Hae-gang held onto him tightly, biting her lower lip at the feeling of being ridden and climbed upon. It was almost too much for her to bear. But just as quickly as the intensity escalated, a light kiss brought her back to reality.</p>
<p>“Sometimes that’s all it takes. Just keep biting if you want to kiss,” he whispered into her ear, his hand openly caressing her waist, creating a sense of heat that was almost unbearable.</p>
<p>As their lips parted, the gentle touch of his hand on her flesh sent waves of pleasure through her body. It was almost too much for her to handle, but she couldn’t bring herself to stop. Her pupils dilated as she clung to him, feeling the soft flesh of his fingers against her chest, crushed gently but pleasurably.</p>
<p>Her back arched as she urged for more, shame momentarily creeping up on her, but quickly replaced by a sense of urgency as she bit her lip, her breath becoming more and more irregular. Woo-jin’s hand moved down toward her thigh, his touch so gentle that it barely registered until he spoke.</p>
<p>“Legs,” he said softly, tapping the underside of her knee.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Hae-gang parted her legs, allowing him to settle comfortably between them. As his hand moved lower, she tensed at the unfamiliar sensation, but his gentle touch soon melted away any resistance.</p>
<p>“Smile,” he said with a mischievous grin, as his finger pressed deeper and deeper, eliciting an uncontrollable shudder from Hae-gang. The heat in her stomach grew, soaking her completely, as Woo-jin’s finger found its way inside her. And as her knee trembled with pleasure, he kissed her delicate neck, sending her over the edge.</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s neck stiffened at the unfamiliar sensation of Woo-jin’s body colliding with his, but it was instantly thrown back as his pleasure surged through him, allowing Woo-jin to delve even deeper into the wetness between his legs.</p>
<p>As his finger probed the shallow depths, Hae-gang’s body quivered with excitement, and a heated sensation spread from her stomach to the base of her spine, making her gasp and moan. Woo-jin’s finger pushed deeper and faster, and Hae-gang struggled to control her breathing and hold back the wave of pleasure that was building within her.</p>
<p>“Min Woo-jin. Wait a minute… uh!” Hae-gang’s plea was cut off by the relentless assault of Woo-jin’s finger, and she felt his knees buckle under the intensity of the sensations coursing through his body.</p>
<p>Finally, as Hae-gang felt herself reaching the peak of her desire, Woo-jin’s finger slipped out, leaving her trembling with frustration and emptiness. She looked up at Woo-jin, her eyes questioning and slightly resentful.</p>
<p>“You’ll get tired if you keep going. You should save your strength,” Hae-gang muttered, her heart still pounding with the intensity of the moment.</p>
<p>As he gazed at the naked form of Hae-gang before him, Woo-jin couldn’t help but imagine what might have been if they had continued, and he was left with nothing to do but hold on to the memory of the pleasure he had experienced.</p>
<p>With a gentle press of her knees, Woo-jin urged Hae-gang to spread his legs wider. The heat between their tightly connected bodies was intense, and Woo-jin eagerly entered her without hesitation.</p>
<p>Hae-gang couldn’t help but cry out, her lips bitten and tears streaming down her cheeks. Woo-jin noticed the pain etched on her forehead and tried to comfort her.</p>
<p>“It’s narrow, so relax,” he said, his lips softly caressing Hae-gang’s eyes.</p>
<p>Hae-gang took a deep breath, her heart pounding in her chest. The heat and pressure were overwhelming, and he struggled to keep her breathing steady. Woo-jin sensed her ragged breath and sought permission to move.</p>
<p>“I’ll move,” he said, as he placed his arms next to Hae-gang’s face.</p>
<p>Hae-gang nodded, holding onto Woo-jin’s arms tightly. Woo-jin’s thrusts were deep and forceful, leaving Hae-gang breathless and moaning with pleasure.</p>
<p>Despite her efforts to resist, Hae-gang’s body was no match for Woo-jin’s insistent movements, and she soon found herself pressed up against the headboard.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s desire for her was intense, and she gave herself over to it completely, his body deeply intertwined with Hae-gang’s.</p>
