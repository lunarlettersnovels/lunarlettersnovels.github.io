            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortuitously, a department head initiated a conversation with him just in the nick of time. Otherwise, he would have undoubtedly turned away without a word. This time, everything seemed to be falling into place quite smoothly.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang’s eyelids trembled beneath the shield of her sunglasses. Despite the significant passage of time, the voice’s owner remained vividly etched in her memory. She was none other than Mrs. Choi, the gracious hostess of Moon -ik and the mother of Yoon Geon-ho.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She attempted to transition her steps as naturally as possible, but her entire being was involuntarily focused on what lay behind her. The thought that she might follow her and reach out to turn her around loomed, causing Hae-gang’s heart to beat erratically. Had she misjudged her presence here? Thankfully, no audible footsteps were trailing behind her..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t until she stepped outside that he finally allowed herself to exhale. Only then did she realize she had been holding her breath? Drawing in a deep breath, she managed to quell her tumultuous emotions and raise her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What captured Hae-gang’s attention wasn’t the vehicle she had arrived in, but a glossy black sports car. It had no business being here when it should have been safely nestled in the mansion’s garage. She blinked, utterly perplexed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I apologize, Madam. It appears that the secretary who left for an errand may have made a mistake. I believe I should investigate. This secretary will see you home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The director Han bowed apologetically, leaving Hae-gang momentarily stunned before she graciously responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, there’s no need to apologize. If anything, I should be the one apologizing. People from the company are wasting their time because of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her smile, accompanied by a hint of lowered brows that seemed to convey an apology, softened her features as she glanced at the secretary busy organizing her belongings in the car’s trunk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m perfectly fine, so let the secretary accompany you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No need, Madam. There’s no obligation,” the secretary politely declined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought I might enjoy a drive while I’m out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, she preferred not to share a car in these circumstances. Displaying displeasure would only heighten her concern, but maintaining a stoic expression felt like too great an effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the Director Han could decline once more, Hae-gang promptly expressed her gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for your assistance today, Director Han, and to you, dear secretary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid a meeting, Geon-ho raised his phone, which had been incessantly buzzing. This particular meeting was quite significant. It marked the first gathering of the head office executives since Yoon Seon-woo’s demise, and at this point, there was no doubt about Moon-ik’s next chairman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was rather amusing to observe those who had been closely aligned with Yoon Seon-woo sneaking glances at him now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the executives exited one by one, giving him a perfunctory nod, Geon-ho maintained a nonchalant expression and dialed a number that appeared as “unavailable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mother, you called?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why aren’t you answering your phone?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Mrs. Choi rarely displayed irritability, Geon-ho’s expression remained unmoved. He simply inquired about the reason for her call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you know who I saw today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn’t particularly interested in whom she had seen. For it to make any impact, it would have to involve his father meeting a new woman, or, taking it further, engaging in a passionate display of affection with her. But such indifferent thoughts were soon shattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s Hae-gang, Hae-gang!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A momentary flash of something crossed Geon-ho’s gaze. He adjusted his tie, attempting to concentrate on the conversation. However, Mrs. Choi, who had just mentioned that name, seemed to contradict her own statement with a bewildered tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, it can’t be. She’s already dead. But can someone look so much like her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geon-ho was also skeptical. The likelihood of mistaken identity was high. Regardless of Hae-gang’s current status, she wouldn’t boldly wander the streets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re suspicious, why don’t you call her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did call her! But there was no response. However, her style was completely different—short hair, an unkempt hair color. Hae-gang always preferred a neater appearance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as Mrs. Choi continued to speak, Geon-ho’s inclination leaned toward the possibility that she had indeed encountered Hae-gang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His first encounter with Hae-gang had been just like that. She had sported short hair, so short that it could be considered awkward, with vibrant hair color. Her attire didn’t set her apart from the average university student you might see on the streets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Mrs. Choi’s standards, Hae-gang’s appearance was far from neat, rather flamboyant and untidy. She had greeted him with a fist bump when they first met in this flashy attire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, the boyfriend I mentioned before. Mr. Yoon Geon-ho.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking back to the audacious Hae-gang from that day brought a faint smile to Geon-ho’s lips. However, that fleeting smile disappeared without a trace as Mrs. Choi continued speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My staff told me she’s Charlie Min’s wife.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The call continued afterward. Geon-ho ended it at an appropriate moment and replayed the conversation with Mrs. Choi in his mind several times. The conversation had been lengthy, filled with unnecessary details, but one phrase, “Charlie Min’s wife,” lingered in his thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Charlie Min’s wife…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geon-ho’s face turned chillingly cold. Hae-gang had to be “Yoon Geon-ho’s wife” until her death. It seemed he had let it go on for too long. It was probably because he had dealt with Seon-woo’s situation first, contrary to his initial plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there was no regret. That wretched child had touched Hae-gang without understanding his limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He put down the elegant pen and leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes. A wry smile tugged at the corner of his lips and finally emerged. It was undoubtedly Min Woo-jin’s doing, along with Seo Haegang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Should I call this audacious or just brave?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a while, it seemed like not a single hair of her head would be seen, and then she managed to come out. Min Woo-jin and Hae-gang must have swollen livers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was nothing wrong with their perspective. It seemed that crossing the threshold had become considerably easier, and that could be used to his advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After organizing his thoughts in this manner and picking up the pen again, a knock at the door interrupted him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yoon Jiwoo, the CEO, has arrived.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Send her away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no need to confront that repulsive face, especially when it had served its purpose. Geon-ho issued a firm command as if there was no value in hesitation. The secretary, who received the command, left with a polite bow. He thought that was the end of the matter, but it wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Isn’t this enough? Do you want to grab me with those dirty hands? Do you all want to sit on the pavement?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resounding voice of Ji-woo echoed beyond the heavy wooden door, accompanied by the rough sound of footsteps and the voices of others trying to restrain her. The secretaries who followed her inside stood in a rigid posture, their gazes fixed on the floor. Geon-ho knew they couldn’t afford to confront J-iwoo, yet he couldn’t help but feel contemptuous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You were the one who said it, that Seon-woo…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone, leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geon-ho’s firm voice pierced through Ji-woo’s outburst as it reverberated in the office. As if these secretaries were thorns on a cushion, they promptly exited one by one. The door closed quietly and seamlessly, leaving Geon-ho to regard Ji-woo with a cold gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seems like someone barged in uninvited, making such a fuss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Ji-woo was immune to Geon-ho’s words as her eyes were already fixed on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shut up! Seon-woo oppa couldn’t have committed suicide. He wouldn’t die like this after striving so hard to become Moon-ik’s leader. You killed him. You’re the one who killed him!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She yelled and raved incessantly, devoid of any semblance of reason, but her words were not entirely untrue. Yoon Seon-woo had not been so fragile as to take his own life, and in reality, it had been Geon-ho who had ordered his death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the phrase “striving so hard” grated on him a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Striving so hard? Like, trying to kill his wife?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among all of Seon-woo’s actions, his inability to comprehend how someone could ruthlessly murder their beloved was the most puzzling. If there was one thing he feared in the world, it was the threat to Hae-gang’s safety and well-being. That fear had driven him to confine her in a suite to avoid any potential danger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, their relationship had grown increasingly complex since that day, but he had never regretted it. Without a doubt, it had been necessary for his peace of mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geon-ho’s thoughts drifted briefly, but Ji-woo’s voice, filled with anger, snapped him back to reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You promised to let it go!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gunho turned his gaze back to Ji-woo. Her face turned red, and her forehead veins bulged as she shouted loudly. What’s the big deal about feeling unfairly treated? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You told me that if I did as you said, you would protect Sun-woo oppa’s secret! That’s why I installed a listening device on oppa’s phone, and…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You also revealed the existence of Hae-gang to Yoon Sunwoo.” Jiwoo, who had been making noise all along, closed her lips abruptly. Gun-ho looked at her as if mocking her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You shared information that Haegang was still alive with Yoon Sunwoo too, remember?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, that…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Yoon Jiwoo had told her older brother about it, she probably didn’t think too much about it. She just happily blurted it out because it seemed like favorable information for her older brother. The reason Yoon Sunwoo had kept it a secret for two years, even after knowing, was clear. He intended to use it as a defense when information about Lim Seyoung came up. And he succeeded in shutting her mouth with it. Unfortunately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t think I believed only you knew the secret.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, she hadn’t shown any signs of knowing it until he mentioned Lim Seyoung. She had been holding back her mouth, waiting for the right moment to strike him as hard as she could. But Jiwoo, the one who should have kept quiet, teased him so lightly. Without even realizing that it was leading to his older brother’s downfall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I overestimated you. I got a much lower level of response than I expected.”</span></p>
