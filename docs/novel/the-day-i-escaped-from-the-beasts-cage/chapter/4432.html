            <p>Woo-jin arrived at the company quickly and entered the elevator. On his hard face, emotions were barely visible.</p>
<p>“Mr. CEO,” the secretary said.</p>
<p>“What?” Woo-jin asked.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, there isn’t,” Woo-jin replied.</p>
<p>This prompted Woo-jin’s secretary, Lee, who had accompanied him from the mansion, to take a look around.</p>
<p>Woo-jin exited the elevator on the highest floor and entered the representative office, where he was greeted by his secretaries. Director Han drew the secretary’s attention when he noticed Woo-jin’s low mood.</p>
<p>“Bum-woo, what’s going on?” Director Han inquired.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” said the secretary.</p>
<p>When Director Han noticed Lee’s broad shoulders drooping like a wet puppy, he looked inside the secretary’s office. Tension was already visible on the secretaries’ faces, as if they had detected an unusual atmosphere.</p>
<p>Woo-Jin’s words, which were in poor condition at the time, resembled weapons rather than horses. They looked inward.</p>
<p>“Can you give me your schedule, Soyoon?” Woo-jin inquired. “I’ll give you the schedule for today.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Woo-jin was still reeling from the morning’s events.</p>
<p>The image of Hae-gang scratching its neck and raising its nails flashed before his eyes. Her small face was filled with the misery that arose when there was nothing he could do, and the self-harming gesture was not hesitant, as if it had not gone through reason.</p>
<p>“Whoo!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Woo-jin realized he should’ve been more cautious. He had no idea that what he said based on her personality would pierce her already dazed heart.</p>
<p>Nothing was pleasant. Hae-gang’s attitude of asking for his permission irritated her husband, who had ruined a person to that extent.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, on the other hand, should not have done so.</p>
<p>He smacked the back of his head against the chair’s head a few times. He had a strong feeling that the awkward atmosphere that had pervaded the house just before he left for work would persist for some time.</p>
<p>“I need to change my focus,” he reasoned.</p>
<p>When a light knock came into the CEO’s room, Woo-jin was thinking about what he could do.</p>
<p>“CEO, this is today’s schedule; there is no change from what I told you yesterday,” said department head Han as he handed over the schedule. Woo-jin confirmed that there had been no change and returned the schedule to Han.</p>
<p>Woo-jin and Han were both at work. Woojin looked up after Han had been standing there for a while without moving, and asked, “Do you have anything to say?”</p>
<p>“Congratulations on your wedding, Mr. President; I’m finally done with what you’ve been sick of,” Han replied.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Woo-jin said, leaning back in his chair, “it was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done, and it’s good to be done with it.”</p>
<p>“Then when can I see her?” Han inquired, and Woo-jin raised an eyebrow at the unexpected question.</p>
<p>“The wife of a bale-wrapped chaebol family is also a good concept,” Han continued, smiling.</p>
<p>“You should introduce her to me so that we can cope properly if something happens in the future.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin replied, “Manager Han Yoo-Jung,” with a dry expression.</p>
<p>“Sir, yes.”</p>
<p>“Even if you don’t know, you must be able to deal with it properly, which is why I’m paying you well.”</p>
<p>Han’s mouth opened weakly in response to Woo-jin’s audacious request, but she quickly accepted it.</p>
<p>“No, that is not incorrect.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin was well aware of Han’s knowledge of his personality, having worked with her since Seora’s inception.</p>
<p>“All I can tell you about her is what’s in the documents you got, Han,” Woo-jin said.</p>
<p>“I understand; I’ll keep that in mind. So, when should we set the honeymoon date? I can adjust the schedule, and I think I can lose up to a week if necessary,” Han inquired.</p>
<p>In response to the unexpected question, Woo-jin shook his head. “You don’t have to be concerned; I’m not going.”</p>
<p>Han, taken aback by the abrupt response, covered her mouth in surprise. “What?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it easier for you if I don’t go?” Woo-jin inquired.</p>
<p>“Of course, it’s easier for me, but… what happens next?” Han paused. Woo-jin would have dismissed it if it had been someone else, but Han’s hesitation indicated that there was a reason.</p>
<p>“Please tell me, Mr. CEO; I’m listening,” Han said.</p>
<p>“Did you decide not to go after consulting with your wife?” Han inquired.</p>
