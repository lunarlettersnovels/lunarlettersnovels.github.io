            <p>Hae-gang closed her eyes tightly, feeling a sense of despair creep over her. She had followed Min Woo-jin’s instructions, cutting her hair and putting on a brave face, but now she was starting to realize just how powerless she truly was.</p>
<p>“What do you expect me to do if they find out?” she had asked him earlier.</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of it,” he had reassured her.</p>
<p>But now, facing a horde of ferocious monsters led by Yoon Geon-ho, Hae-gang felt helpless, like prey facing a beast with a broken leg. She had always known that Yoon Seon-woo and Yoon Geon-ho were monsters, and nothing had changed since the time she had belonged to their group.</p>
<p>“Hey, do you know Yoon Geon-ho? My sister-in-law is here,” Seon Woo said suddenly, his grip on Hae-gang’s arm tightening painfully.</p>
<p>Her breath caught in her throat at the mention of Yoon Geon-ho’s name. She tried to pull her arm free, but the grip only grew stronger.</p>
<p>As she lowered her head to avoid Seon-Woo’s stare, Hae-gang’s eyes fell on the coffee cup she was still holding. It was then that she finally understood Min Woo-jin’s cryptic message: “Drink your coffee hot.” He had given her a weapon in case of an unforeseen situation.</p>
<p>Feeling a glimmer of hope, Hae-gang steadied her shaking hand and took a sip of the scalding coffee. She could feel the heat coursing through her body, emboldening her, and she summoned all her courage to face the monsters in front of her.</p>
<p>Trembling hands caused the coffee to overflow from the cup. Hae-gang lifted her head, bewildered by her anxiety, and met Seon-woo’s intense gaze. Confronting this person was overwhelming, and she felt an urgent need to escape, leaving no room for other options.</p>
<p>Chew!</p>
<p>Without warning, she splashed the hot coffee she held onto Seon-woo’s hand, causing him to yell in pain. His coat got a bit wet, but the thick material prevented him from feeling the heat.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of his hand falling, Hae-gang pulled away and ran as fast as she could. Seon-woo’s menacing voice echoed behind her, accompanied by the sound of a car engine.</p>
<p>Lost in unfamiliar surroundings, she couldn’t determine the safest route home or gather the energy to scream for help. With each breath, her judgment became clouded. Nonetheless, she kept running, fueled by sheer adrenaline.</p>
<p>Hae-gang, frustrated by the muffler that obstructed her vision, tore it off, revealing a light pink scarf in her hand. She heard the car closing in and knew she had to find a narrow alley where cars couldn’t follow.</p>
<p>She bit her lip to prevent tears from streaming down her face. Crying would only waste her energy. Instead, she reached for her clutch bag and took out her phone. She had only two contacts saved on her phone, with Woojin’s number being the most recent.</p>
<p>As she was about to call him, the sound of the car drew closer, prompting her to turn around abruptly.</p>
<p>Hae-gang scrambled to avoid being hit by the speeding car. As she stumbled and struggled to regain her balance, Seon-woo beat her to it and grabbed her arm. Panic gripped her as she stared up at him, her eyes wide and confused. But before she could react, Seon-woo was hit by a car coming up from behind.</p>
<p>As she lay on the ground, dazed and struggling to get up, Seon-woo stood over her. His eyes were cold and hard as he looked down at her. Hae-gang recoiled in fear, but Seon-woo’s attention was focused on her phone, which had fallen from her pocket.</p>
<p>With a quick and deliberate motion, Seon-woo crushed the phone under his polished shoe. Hae-gang tried to intervene, but the sight of him was so terrifying that she froze in place. Then he struck her across the face, leaving a painful mark and the taste of blood in her mouth.</p>
<p>It was the first time in her life that Hae-gang had been hit. She was the youngest daughter of Chairman Suh and had never been subject to violence before. Even Yoon Geon-ho, her former husband, had never laid a hand on her, despite being locked up in a hotel for two years.</p>
