            <p>“I am a nonexistent individual in this world, Min Woo-jin.”</p>
<p><em>Are my words too controversial?</em></p>
<p>Woo-jin was silent for some time. Hae-gang opened a new can as she awaited the end of the silence.</p>
<p>He stood up when the second can was half empty.</p>
<p>“Let’s return.”</p>
<p>Due to the fact that he had left first, she could only see his back, but her voice revealed her complex emotions.</p>
<p>She regrettably shared her burden with others. Hae-gang looked at Woo-Jin’s back as he walked away from the can’s remaining contents.</p>
<p>The steps eventually ceased, and Woo-jin, who had been standing still for some time, turned around and walked towards her once more. When he got close enough to hear her, Hae-gang apologized immediately.</p>
<p>“I believe I said something incorrectly. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, I do not believe it is your fault, so you need not apologize. Because I was interested.”</p>
<p>“Still…”</p>
<p>“I am sincere. I was somewhat surprised by the unexpected words just now.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin uttered his words in an unusual manner. His confused look and words that barely made sense showed that he didn’t know what was going on.</p>
<p>“Let’s return.”</p>
<p>She seemed to have reached a point where she could no longer enjoy the atmosphere, so she nodded and tried to get up quickly. However, Woo-jin prevented her from doing so.</p>
<p>“Drink everything, and then let’s depart.”</p>
<p>She did not bother to say that it was acceptable, which was up to her chin. It was evident that no matter what she did, she would always return the same answer in a different format. Hae-gang appeared to know what type of individual this man was.</p>
<p>His words are mean, and he doesn’t show much emotion, but in the end, he gives in as if he had no choice.</p>
<p>It was similar to the promise he kept with no benefit, the side dish that is served three times a day with rice, and the time they traveled all the way here using comfort as an excuse.</p>
<p>Even now, her buttocks are glued together as if she had just risen from her seat. Long ago, “he” was reflected in Woo-jin’s awkward kindness, and a bitter smile hung on her lips.</p>
<p>With the sound of the waves serving as a snack, even water tastes salty. She was about to leave her seat after cleaning up the empty beer cans she had consumed, but a couple passing by caught her eye.</p>
<p>Hae-gang was the first of the two to notice their gaze.</p>
<p>She quickly pressed down on the padded hat she had just taken off because she thought someone was watching her. Woo-jin regarded her bustling behavior with strange eyes.</p>
<p><em>Why is that so?</em></p>
<p>“Move swiftly. Hurry up!”</p>
<p>She threw the plastic bag containing the empty can into the trash can immediately adjacent to the bench, and then stood up. He is dragged meekly by the arm, although he does not know why.</p>
<p>However, the couple walking in front of Hae-gang and Woo-jin was much faster. She shut her eyes in response to the voice behind her.</p>
<p>“Chief Charlie, correct?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin turned around upon hearing his voice. Hae-gang regretted her indifference.</p>
<p>She did not leave because she had been released for some time. She could not remain in the hospital room indefinitely, but she had to be as cautious as possible.</p>
<p>As she expressed regret after regret, she felt warmth on her hand.</p>
<p>“ah… … .”</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes and lowered her gaze, she noticed that Woo-jin was holding her hand. She must have been trembling violently without being aware of it.</p>
<p>The fact that Hae-gang hid her face behind Woo-jin’s back was never a conscious decision. She simply did not want anyone to see her face, so her body took the initiative.</p>
<p>Still, the situation continued to deteriorate.</p>
<p>“Wow, you are my inspiration! Please excuse me, may I take your photograph?”</p>
<p>“I’m very sorry. Because my companion is uncomfortable, I do not believe I can take photos.”</p>
<p>In spite of Woo-Jin’s steadfast refusal, they did not know when to give up.</p>
<p>“Then simply sign! Just sign me up! ”</p>
<p>The woman cheered as the man dug around in her bag and pulled out a notebook.</p>
<p>Slowly, individuals began to gather around the disturbance. Hearing voices from all directions, Hae-gang concealed her face further.</p>
<p>A little strength is added to the hand that is gripped. She knew he was trying to make her feel better, but she couldn’t calm down.</p>
<p>They were surrounded by people of unknown nationalities.</p>
<p>Hae-gang waited for this time to be over, hoping that her hat and Woo-Jin’s reliable back would hide her.</p>
<p>After hurriedly signing the autograph, Woo-jin embraced her and continued on.</p>
<p>At that moment, Hae-gang heard the sound of the camera clicking. As she unconsciously turned her head to follow the sound, she was met with a calm voice and a hand pressing firmly on her hat.</p>
<p>“Do not look back, proceed. Keep your head slightly lower.”</p>
<p>Even after returning to the car, she had to catch her breath and wheeze for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>“I am sorry.”</p>
<p>She had to reject Woo-Jin’s apology, but even if she had done so with a trembling voice, it would not have been credible.</p>
<p>Rather, he shook his head multiple times. She believed that this did not adequately convey her message, so she finally opened her terribly trembling lips.</p>
<p>“Why is Min Woo-Jin sorry?” That is all she has to say.</p>
<p>….”</p>
<p>She chose to visit this location, but she tapped her chest multiple times at the sparse words that were spoken. It took a considerable amount of time for her heart, which had been pounding as if she had run 100 meters, to calm down.</p>
<p>“Because Min Woo-jin does not realize how much today’s excursion means to me. Thank you so much for helping me reach this point.”</p>
<p>He smiled to ensure he did not feel regretful. Nevertheless, Woo-Jin’s face, whose name is unsolvable, suggests that it was not very natural.</p>
<p>Ultimately, she smiled and turned her head away from Woo-jin so he could not see her crying face. Outside, it was pitch black, just as it had been on the day they fled the hotel.</p>
<p>Please do not apologize. “Because I feel less guilt.”</p>
<p>It bore no resemblance to a plea. Woo-jin increased the heater’s temperature and started the car in silence.</p>
