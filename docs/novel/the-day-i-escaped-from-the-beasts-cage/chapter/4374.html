            <p>It hadn’t even been thirty minutes since the meeting ended. Just about to sign the first document, Woo-jin set down his pen and looked up at his secretary.</p>
<p>“Who’s here?” he asked, his tone edged with annoyance. He clicked his tongue, knowing full well that asking again wouldn’t change who had come.</p>
<p>Before his secretary could respond, Woo-jin made his decision. “Send them away.”</p>
<p>“But, sir, they seemed quite serious,” the secretary replied, trembling slightly.</p>
<p>The pen, set down with more force this time, made a louder noise. Recognizing the sign of Woo-jin’s growing irritation, the secretary bit his lip.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s expression remained neutral as he asked, “Do I need to consider Yoon Jiwoo’s feelings now?” His eyes briefly scanned the documents on his desk before returning to the secretary, clearly conveying his impatience. He had too much work to waste time on an unannounced visitor.</p>
<p>Though he understood the secretary’s predicament, he didn’t have the luxury of entertaining unexpected guests. “Secretary Lee.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Politely send them back. And advise them that future visits should be scheduled properly,” Woo-jin ordered firmly, leaving no room for argument. The secretary nodded reluctantly.</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>However, things didn’t go as Woo-jin planned. Just as Secretary Lee was about to leave, the door burst open. Startled, Secretary Lee nearly collided with the door, clutching his chest in shock. Voices filled the room as Chief Han and other staff members protested.</p>
<p>“This is inappropriate, Ms. Yoon!”</p>
<p>“You can’t enter without permission!”</p>
<p>Amidst the commotion, Woo-jin set his pen down for the third time. He had forgotten how impatient Ji-woo could be. Understanding her nature didn’t make his headache any less severe. Sighing, he stood up, preparing to send her away with a customary refusal.</p>
<p>“Ms. Yoon, you can’t just—”</p>
<p>“Please, help me, Min Woo-jin!” Her plea, charged with desperation, piqued his interest enough to make him pause.</p>
<p>“Take a seat,” he said, gesturing to the chair across from him. With a nod, he dismissed the protesting staff outside his office.</p>
<p>Ji-woo, having successfully forced her way into the office, sat gracefully on the offered sofa, crossing her legs. She tucked an errant strand of hair behind her ear, a deliberate gesture to draw attention. Her short skirt inched higher, and the new decorations on her manicured nails glittered under the light.</p>
<p>Woo-jin couldn’t help but let out a dry laugh at her blatant behavior.</p>
<p>“You said you needed help. What exactly are you trying to do now?”</p>
<p>Ji-woo pretended not to understand, resting her arms on her knees and leaning forward slightly. Her tightly-fitted dress accentuated her figure.</p>
<p>“Do you need a change of clothes for that expensive dress you’ve spilled something on?” Woo-jin asked, his tone dripping with sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Why? Does it turn you on?” she shot back, her words as sharp as ever.</p>
<p>Woo-jin debated whether he should just throw this audacious woman out. If this was her reason for barging into his office, it seemed absurdly reckless. He considered voicing his thoughts but decided to soften his words.</p>
<p>“I suggest you head back safely, Ms. Yoon,” he said, reaching for the call button.</p>
<p>Ji-woo quickly straightened up, realizing she wasn’t getting her way. “Okay, fine!” she snapped, visibly irritated but holding back.</p>
<p>Woo-jin knew there was no point in advising her on her behavior; the one person who might have corrected her was no longer around. Not that it was his problem.</p>
<p>“So, what do you need?” he prompted, hoping to get to the point.</p>
<p>She finally opened her brightly painted lips. “Min Woo-jin, have you ever thought about getting a divorce?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin briefly regretted letting her in. This conversation was already proving to be a waste of time. He rubbed his forehead, clearly annoyed, but felt obligated to respond.</p>
<p>“I have never considered it.”</p>
<p>“Well, could you start considering it now?” she asked, her eyes wide as if she thought this was great news.</p>
<p>He didn’t find it amusing. The idea that she might expect a positive response was frustrating.</p>
<p>“Ms. Yoon, it would be great if you thought things through before speaking. Can you manage that?” he retorted, his patience wearing thin.</p>
<p>“Are you saying I’m not thinking?!” Ji-woo screeched, finally understanding his insult. Her loud voice made Woo-jin lean back slightly, away from the verbal assault.</p>
<p>He didn’t respond verbally, just fixed her with a stony glare.</p>
<p>“Now is not the time for temper tantrums. When you said you needed help, I thought it was a life-or-death situation,” he said, unimpressed.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s just that…” she began, her bravado fading as reality set in. The secretary brought in tea right then, and Woo-jin took a sip before looking back at her.</p>
<p>“Let’s not waste any more time. What do you want from me?” he asked, cutting to the chase.</p>
<p>“Listen!” Ji-woo started to raise her voice again but quickly glanced at Woo-jin and lowered it. “I’ve been saying it from the start. Consider getting a divorce.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin tilted his head slightly in puzzlement. It was strange. She hadn’t mentioned Hae-gang’s name even once. Did she not know? His already low opinion of her sank even further at her ignorance.</p>
<p>“And how would that benefit you?” he asked, his voice dripping with skepticism.</p>
<p>“If you divorce and marry me, I’ll have the backing I need to stop my big brother—no, Yoon Geonho—from pushing me around,” she explained.</p>
<p>Woo-jin couldn’t help but let out a small laugh. So, she wanted him to replace the protection Yoon Seonwoo had provided.</p>
<p>“I decline,” he said flatly.</p>
<p>Ji-woo’s voice rose again, frustrated by his refusal. “At least hear what you can gain—”</p>
<p>“Even if you offered me Moon-Ik, my answer would remain the same.”</p>
<p>Ji-woo’s eyes wavered at the mention of Moonik. She seemed genuinely surprised. “Why not?”</p>
<p>“First, I doubt you have that kind of power. Second, even if you did, you wouldn’t follow through,” Woo-jin replied coldly.</p>
<p>“Min Woo-jin!” Jiwoo screamed, standing up abruptly, her face contorted with anger. Woo-jin chuckled at her outburst.</p>
<p>“Ms. Yoon,” he said calmly.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You have two options now that you’re standing: sit back down or leave,” he said, his voice low and commanding.</p>
<p>Ji-woo’s face twisted in a mixture of rage and desperation. She didn’t want to sit back down—it would be humiliating. But she also couldn’t afford to leave without securing her future. Her manicured nails scratched at the leather of her mini bag, the sound grating. Realizing what she had done, she began to smooth the scratched leather frantically. Woo-jin smiled at her discomfort.</p>
<p>“Relax. I’m joking. Sit down. I still have some questions,” he said.</p>
<p>“Questions?” Ji-woo repeated, reluctantly sitting back down. She eyed him warily, her earlier bravado fading.</p>
<p>Woo-jin nodded. “Tell me about the woman your half-brother kept in the Rudy Suite for two years.”</p>
<p>Ji-woo’s bag slipped from her lap, hitting the floor with a thud. She clapped her hands over her mouth to stifle a gasp. Her reaction confirmed the truth, but she still tried to deny it.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about—”</p>
<p>“Don’t bother lying,” Woo-jin cut her off. “We both know exactly what I’m talking about. Now, why don’t you start telling the truth?”</p>
<p>You can’t possibly know,” Woo-jin scoffed, dismissing her denial with a wave as he opened a document, fixing his gaze on it. “After the Aerian incident, hasn’t Seo Hae-gang been there all along?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? I don’t know anything! I swear!” Jiwoo, now truly intent on leaving, stumbled over her fallen bag as she stood up.</p>
<p>Is this what a cornered rat feels like? With no way out, she was on the verge of tears. She stomped on the bag a few times in frustration, but it didn’t help. The sound of a compact mirror breaking inside finally snapped her out of her frenzy.</p>
<p>She decided to abandon the bag and leave. It was a limited edition she had struggled to find, but it was now nothing more than a tattered rag. Without pausing to catch her breath, she started towards the door, her mind in turmoil.</p>
<p>Only she and Yoon Geon-ho knew about Seo Hae-gang’s existence—no one else, not even Chairman Yoon or Mrs. Choi. How could Woo-jin possibly know?</p>
<p>“I have her,” Woo-jin’s voice sliced through her thoughts like a knife. Jiwoo’s hand froze on the doorknob. She turned around slowly, eyes wide with disbelief.</p>
<p>Woo-jin met her gaze, his look as sharp as a dagger. “Seo Haegang. I have her.”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible…” Jiwoo muttered.</p>
<p>“Now you understand why I have no intention of helping you,” he said, his eyes dark with anger.</p>
<p>Seeing the fury in his eyes, Jiwoo couldn’t muster a response. It was clear now—she had come to the wrong person for help.</p>
