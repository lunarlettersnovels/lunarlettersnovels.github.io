            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang listened to Woo-jin’s matter-of-fact tone as if he were conducting a business meeting. He couldn’t help but feel slightly embarrassed when Woo-jin mentioned sleeping in the same room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is there really no other option? Maybe it would be better to have a partition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin chuckled at Hae-gang’s suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no need for that. You’ll be using a separate bed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang was momentarily hopeful, but Woo-jin’s response dispelled any illusions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then there’s no point in combining the rooms,” Woo-jin added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang couldn’t help but regret her decision to hire servants for the house. She had hoped it would make things easier, but now she was regretting it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang’s face reddened as Woo-jin smiled, as if he noticed Hae-gang’s discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wouldn’t want to accidentally touch you,” Woo-jin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang vigorously shook his head, feeling even more embarrassed by Woo-jin’s remark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Absolutely not,” Hae-gang stammered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then there’s no problem,” Woo-jin replied with a shrug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang was left feeling uneasy, his thoughts were jumbled. He had only ever shared a bed with two people: his father and “him.” The thought of sharing a bed with a man was unfamiliar and unsettling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haegang was lost in thought, gripping her hair with both hands. She had never shared a bed with anyone except for her father and the person she had married after graduating from college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their relationship had been a formal arrangement on paper, with only one official and one private document binding them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang wondered if this was the right thing to do, but Wooj-in, who was growing impatient, interrupted her thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s get started. May I speak now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang realized that she had been ignoring Woo-jin and quickly nodded, not sure what to expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, of course,” Hae-gang said, bracing herself for what Woo-jin was about to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to Hae-gang’s surprise, Woo-jin’s words caught her off guard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since we are married, we need to go on a honeymoon,” Woo-jin announced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*********</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it that good?” Haegang asked, not feeling the need to say no because, honestly, it was good. It wasn’t just good, it was exciting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason, of course, was the honeymoon. Those words that came out of Woo-jin’s mouth about twenty minutes ago still echoed in her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was not excited just because it was a ‘honeymoon’ trip. The excitement was the trip itself. No matter how much she tried to explain the feeling, there was no way Woo-jin could understand it. So, she didn’t try to make them understand and just enjoyed the feeling herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang was in a state of excitement for twenty minutes, laughing and chatting with Woo-jin over tea. Woo-jin’s face, smiling at her, was exceptionally soft, and Hae-gang felt embarrassed for acting silly. She cleared her throat slightly, regaining her composure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin’s face appeared with a smile, that was unusually soft, causing a belated embarrassment. With a small cough, he pressed down on the cheekbones that rose to the fullest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang asked, “Where are we going?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as it’s a place he doesn’t know.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his words were cut off by a ringtone. Woo-jin looked at the phone screen to see the number and then turned it upside down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang asked, “Aren’t you going to answer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin replied, “It’s an unsaved number.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haegang persisted, “But what about an important message? I’ll still get it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang was anxious for no reason and rushed Woo-jin. This was not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Woo-jin picked up his cell phone again. Hae-gang carefully lowered the teacup, as if trying not to make any noise. This, too, was not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin answered the phone and said, “Yes, I’m Min Woo Jin.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin’s voice echoed in the dining room, and the opponent’s voice was also heard. The whole space, including Haegang, was too quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opponent introduced himself, “Nice to meet you, CEO Min. I’m Yoon Sunwoo of Moon-Ik Steel.”</span></p>
