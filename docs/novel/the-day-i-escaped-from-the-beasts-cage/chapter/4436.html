        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang held the cell phone that Woo-jin had made, bearing her identity. She noticed that while new products had been released on this line since the last time she had a cell phone, there had been no significant difference compared to two years ago. The only change she noticed was that the screen was slightly bigger and more precise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As she opened the contact list, tears welled in her eyes as she saw that it was empty, with nothing saved. The fact that the number she needed to save was still in her head, but the owner of the contact no longer existed filled her with sadness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I miss you,” she whispered, thinking of her mom, dad, brother, and step-sister. A crying smile appeared on Hae-gang’s face as she sat with her knees pulled up, burying her face. She realized that human greed is endless, which could be what Woo-jin said about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she was only in the hotel, Hae-gang had thought that she wouldn’t have any wishes if she got out of there, but now she was greedy for something else. She wished that everyone would stay with her or that she could go back in time for two years. But she knew deep down that this wish was more difficult than leaving the hotel. Still, she didn’t feel like dying anymore. She couldn’t help thinking that it would be faster to meet someone dead when they were stuck in a hotel and couldn’t go anywhere, but that wasn’t the case now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had a grace period of three years and now has a new family. So she decided to do her best to love Woo-jin for 3 years. There was no one left who loved her, and there was no longer a “he” who was forcibly holding her so that she couldn’t die, but she needed something to keep her heart alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang wanted to live a daily life that was not too stark but not too burdensome. She wanted to find a balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m here,” said Woo-jin, surprising Hae-gang and causing her to wipe away her tears quickly. She realized she had spent too much time thinking alone and didn’t even realize the sky had grown dark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was fortunate that she hadn’t turned on the light, as she didn’t want Woo-jin to see her rubbing her eyes in a hurry. Hae-gang stood up from the sofa to greet him, but she was not used to the house’s structure yet, and within a few steps, she hit her shin on something solid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Argh!” she exclaimed in pain, as she couldn’t move from where she was hit. The chandelier lit up, and Woo-jin, who checked where she was, strode closer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What was that sound just now, did you get hurt somewhere?” Woo-jin asked as Hae-gang looked up at him with a tearful face and sat down on the sofa again. When she rubbed her shin, the pain arose again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ouch,” she said, as it hurt to the point where she cried a little. She knew it would be black and blue tomorrow. Woo-jin, who put his shopping bag on the corner of the sofa, told her to wait and went down the stairs. He came back with a spray patch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can smell a little,” he warned, as Hae-gang pulled her leg back without realizing it because of the hands that grabbed her ankle without hesitation. Sitting at a table a little lower than the sofa, he looked at it with curious eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t you like the smell?” he asked, and Hae-gang quickly reassured him that it wasn’t the smell, but the unexpected touch. She took the patch and sprayed it on her shin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin then brought out the shopping bag he had left earlier, which contained a few homewares. She secretly hid the patch and took out a soft pajama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a rabbit,” she said, surprised at the cute taste of Woo-jin. She opened the pajama wide to show him the rabbit’s face stamped white on the soft material. Woo-jin’s face, which was usually blunt, caught her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I ordered it from the secretary, she chose it,” Woo-jin said, as Hae-gang looked into the shopping bag that was still convex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, this, too?” she asked, as even after taking one out, an awkward expression quickly came to mind over his blunt face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the bag were men’s pajamas with the same design but different colors. There was no doubt that it was set with Navy’s for him and was stamped on a dark gray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang’s face became strange as if she were smiling at a couple’s pajamas that only couples who enjoy newlyweds would wear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m looking for an excuse to fire my secretary,” he said bluntly.</span></p>
