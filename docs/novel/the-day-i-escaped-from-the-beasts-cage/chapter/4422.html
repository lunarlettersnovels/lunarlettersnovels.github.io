            <p>As it was a private plane, the interior was completely different from Airea’s plane, but it strangely overlapped. from the unique round ceiling of an aircraft body to a narrow and long interior, an oval window that is not open, and small lights embedded in various places. Even if she didn’t want to do that, her eyes took care of it and looked at each one, looking for similarities to that day.</p>
<p>“Han Dawn?” Woo-jin’s voice, sensing something strange in her, seemed to be heard from afar even though he was right next to her. The hand, which had randomly stirred it and found a place to lean on, was filled with something. Hae-gang, who had clung to it tightly without even having time to check what it was, did not want to let go of it with the feeling of grabbing at least a rope.</p>
<p>“Close your eyes.”</p>
<p>She wants to do that too, but it doesn’t work. Even if she opens her mouth to answer, all that comes out is her breath. She could hear not only Woo-jin but also the doctor calling her, but her eyes were busy looking around the inside of the plane. Is this in good shape? Is there any corrosion anywhere? Is there enough fuel? All sorts of thoughts raced through her head, but for an instant, her eyes were covered in darkness.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you tired of rolling your eyes so quickly?”</p>
<p>When nothing was caught in the field of vision, the wheezing sound of breathing subsided. No matter how many times she blinked, she couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p>With her vision blocked, her remaining five senses began to function properly. The first thing she noticed was the pulse she felt under her hand. The heartbeat that was delivered was exceptionally loud for her sensitive senses.</p>
<p>It was only then that Haegang realized that what she was holding onto was Woojin’s arm. Knowing that she had squeezed out the strength she had been sucking on, she was about to pull it out but was stopped.</p>
<p>“I’m holding on if it helps. Did you say it’s not very difficult?”</p>
<p>“… … Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Can I take your hand off?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang swallowed her saliva and nodded. She felt her hand slowly recede and opened her eyes. It was still the same inside, but it was not as difficult as before.</p>
<p>Woo-jin made sure she was okay and led her to the bed inside.</p>
<p>“Sleep. I will wake you when we arrive.”</p>
<p>After that, some time passed. She couldn’t let go of Woo-jin’s hand until the plane took off, but it was fine once she got used to it. After all, humans are animals of adaptation.</p>
<p>But apart from that, Hae-gang doubted whether what she took before departure was really sleeping pills. Also, she couldn’t sleep at all, really not at all.</p>
<p>She shot a look of disbelief at Woo-jin, and his gaze, which had been fixed on the tablet the whole time, returned to her.</p>
<p>“Anything to say?”</p>
<p>“Give me one more sleeping pill. I can’t sleep at all.”</p>
<p>Then Woojin, who had been tapping on the tablet with his pen, turned towards her.</p>
<p>“Where is it bad? Your complexion seems fine.”</p>
<p>“Not good.”</p>
<p>He thought about it for a moment, then quickly nodded.</p>
<p>“Go to the doctor and ask for it, and they will give it to you.”</p>
<p>With Woojin’s permission, Hae-gang got down from the bed and pushed the door open. She only applied a little force, but it opened like an automatic door. Before admiring the lightness, Hae-gang went to the doctor and abruptly held out her hand.</p>
<p>“I can’t sleep at all. I need one more sleeping pill.”</p>
<p>“No, madam. There’s nothing good about overdosing on sleeping pills.”</p>
<p>“Just one, please.”</p>
<p>In the end, her doubts were further amplified as she reached into her bag, giving up so easily.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes wide and waited for the doctor to take out the medicine bottle, then snatched it like a shot.</p>
<p>“Doctor!”</p>
<p>a name written on a small, round bottle. The name of the drug was written in big letters as if no effort had been made to deceive her.</p>
<p>Hae-gang returned to Woo-jin with her feet stomping and put the medicine bottle down on the table where he was sitting. She couldn’t help but be timid, so she placed it down very gently.</p>
<p>“I knew it would be like this. Isn’t this a sleeping pill?!”</p>
<p>A light nod was given by Woojin as he glanced at the medicine cabinet a little farther away from the tablet.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is a vitamin.”</p>
<p>It was. The English letters written in big letters on the small medicine cabinet were vitamins.</p>
<p>Hae-gang lost the will to be angry at his answer, not feeling any guilt for cheating on her.</p>
<p>The pen, which had lightly tapped the tablet as if finishing something, was spinning in Woo-jin’s hand, and the smiling face looked up at her, who was still energetic.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Ms. Dawn. Now you can get on the plane without any help.”</p>
<p><em>Damn, this.</em></p>
<p>It was Hae-gang who wanted to hit someone after a long time.</p>
<p>The sun was already setting when they transferred from a private plane to a seaplane and then to a boat and arrived at the resort.</p>
<p>The sunset was as pretty as the sea in the Maldives, so she thought the sky was beautiful before feeling relieved that she had come all the way here.</p>
<p>“It’s so pretty whenever I come here.”</p>
<p>“This is my first time.”</p>
<p>Woojin, who didn’t seem to be impressed by anything, seems to recognize pretty things. He didn’t know how to move his gaze, stuck in the sun that dyed the sky red.</p>
<p>“If you’ve been that successful, can’t you relax?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really like to travel, and in recent years I’ve been so busy with work that I haven’t had time to go anywhere.”</p>
<p>She lowered her head to the sea right in front of the resort. The water’s surface reflected the sunset light as it was, and it made her feel as if she had the sky under her feet.</p>
<p>She could go in tomorrow, but she felt sorry for nothing. Why couldn’t it be right now?</p>
