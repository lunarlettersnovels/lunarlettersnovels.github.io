            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang wanted to stop Woo-jin from talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, if it’s something that’s changed recently, there’s also an art theater not far from the Grace. If you like musicals, you might want to check them out. And-“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait a minute!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words that were were cut off by her raised voice. Hae-gang quickly put her hand down, not wanting to miss the silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s okay if you don’t tell me. I’m not going to go anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was embarrassing to be walking alone on the street leading to Moon Ik’s house. She had been living in his house as a daughter-in-law for five years. It would be dreadful even to imagine if she met someone she knew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Woo-jin had a different idea. He turned his head towards her and brought up the most fundamental problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you plan to stay inside the house for the next three years?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is… ” For a moment, her words were stuck, and she stuttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just go out and about. People are less interested in others than you might think. Just put on sunglasses to hide your face, hold a coffee, and be like everyone else. That’s all you need to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang’s words stumbled awkwardly, and she mumbled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin turned off the car engine, unfastened his seatbelt, and turned slightly towards Hae-gang. Hae-gang couldn’t bear to look at him, afraid she might look pitiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re really nervous, let’s change your style a little bit. That alone can easily change your image.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang brushed her long hair back in response to Woo-jin’s reasonable suggestion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He” had always liked to kept her hair long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He” was particularly fond of her long hair, so when he called a hair stylist to the room, he only asked for the ends to be trimmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one day, when Hae-gang saw the stylist’s embarrassed face as she mentioned of cutting her hair short, Hae-gang never brought it up again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, she grabbed a pair of scissors lying on the table and cut her hair in front of “him.” She was able to do so because the dinner menu included lobster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to this, the chef who came to prepare the lobster had a shocked expression, and “he” was furious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t you know that I don’t like seafood? It’s rude to force people to eat something they don’t like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t long after Hae-gang had been forced to stay there, so she still had the energy to resist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two people lost their jobs that day: the chef and the stylist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang didn’t feel particularly sorry for them. They were the ones who had willingly cooperated with “him”, accepting money and going along with his demands even though they knew he was using force to keep Hae-gang there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang hadn’t cut her hair since that day. As always, everything was done according to “his” wishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hae-gang remembered the past, she didn’t want to think about it and hit herself on the head a few times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin, getting out of the car, looked at Hae-gang with a strange expression as if he were looking at a crazy person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just don’t feel good about remembering such unpleasant memories.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin’s eyes still held a suspicious look, but he didn’t seem interested in Hae-gang’s strange behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting out of the car, Woo-jin walked up the stairs on one side of the garage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang hurriedly followed him, and the conversation continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you don’t want to go outside, I’ll call someone to come home. If you have a specific brand of clothes you want, put them on the table before you go to work tomorrow. I’ll ask them to bring a sample.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What if I get caught?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin, who had climbed to the top of the stairs, looked down at Hae-gang. Hae-gang awkwardly forced a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just go out fearlessly as you said. What will happen if they all find out?” Hae-gang asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll take care of it then,” Woo-jin replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to Hae-gang’s worries, Woo-jin pushed open the door as if it was the most natural thing in the world. The door, which seemed quite heavy, opened quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang stepped aside, as if to go in first, and gave a small thank you to Woo-jin before stepping into the ample space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warm air wrapped itself around her as if it had been waiting. Hae-gang was still relaxed, and she heard Woo-jin’s voice from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So change the information embedded in your head first. From now on, your husband is me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang nodded, still feeling overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events. She knew she needed time to process everything and figure out what she truly wanted. But as she stood there with Woo-jin by her side, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of warmth and hope for the future.</span></p>
