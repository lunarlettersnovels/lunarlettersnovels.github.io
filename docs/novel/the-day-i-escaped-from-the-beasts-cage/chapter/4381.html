        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“Are you here?”</p>
<p>“Why are you just standing there? What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang understood what Woo-jin’s interrupted sentence meant. He was probably going to say something like, “What’s wrong? You’re standing there like a constipated dog.” Even she couldn’t help but find her current state amusing.</p>
<p>The mechanical sound of Woo-jin’s car entering the parking lot signaled the connection between the parking lot and the door. She had managed to hold the door handle, but now she was frozen in place, unable to move at all. She couldn’t greet him as he came down the stairs, but she also couldn’t wait quietly. Her appearance perfectly matched the words Woo-jin had just swallowed.</p>
<p>As Woo-jin ascended the stairs, he grabbed the door from the opposite side and raised an eyebrow, signifying he needed her to move. Hae-gang immediately let go of the doorknob, taking a step back. Even though the weather had warmed up enough that she didn’t need a coat, she could feel the chilly air coming from Woo-jin.</p>
<p>“Is it still raining?”</p>
<p>“It seems to have just stopped.”</p>
<p>Woojin’s gaze extended into the house, searching for the faint scent wafting from the dining area. Hae-gang watched his reaction, her heart pounding with nervousness and excitement.</p>
<p>“Is dinner soybean paste stew?”</p>
<p>Judging from his expression, it seemed the choice of menu was acceptable. Hae-gang, still thrilled, took his arm and led him into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Are you hungry?”</p>
<p>“A bit. I couldn’t eat lunch because of a busy schedule.”</p>
<p>“That’s too bad.”</p>
<p>Her words sounded filled with sympathy, but her expression and tone didn’t match. She hoped that skipping lunch would make dinner taste even better, given that there were no appetizing side dishes. But her expectations were shattered when Woo-jin emptied his bowl in a few bites.</p>
<p>“Madam, it seems your cooking skills are getting slower. I’m starting to admire you more and more.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang stared at her spoon in her mouth, her eyes wide.</p>
<p><em>What on earth did I just hear?</em></p>
<p>He stared at her with a bewildered look, seemingly oblivious to the emotions as deep as the ocean that she was radiating.</p>
<p>“I… I made it…”</p>
<p>Her timid words made his hand, which was about to scoop up a spoonful of the delectable doenjang stew, hesitate and retreat. Hae-gang poked at the rice with a forlorn expression.</p>
<p>Hae-gang had never really wielded a knife properly, and even preparing the ingredients was a significant obstacle for her. She had come a long way from not knowing how to slice a pumpkin, but it still stung when someone as important as Woo-jin didn’t appreciate her efforts.</p>
<p>For what felt like an eternity, Woo-jin just blinked like a startled frog. Finally, he managed to open his mouth, which had been firmly sealed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Even with his timely apology, her heart was not so easily appeased.</p>
<p>“I bought flowers and placed them all around today. You didn’t even notice, and then you sent that strange text. Did you see the garden on the table?”</p>
<p>“I saw them.”</p>
<p>“You saw them? You saw them and didn’t say anything?”</p>
<p>“I thought the house lady had put them there.”</p>
<p>Occasionally, the house lady changed things like flowers and lighting to refresh the ambiance in their home. But Hae-gang didn’t know that, and her eyes were filled with disappointment.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s face became uncertain, perhaps due to the persistent misunderstandings. He reluctantly looked away and noticed the bouquet on the dining table.</p>
<p>“The vase is lovely. Did you buy it together?”</p>
<p>“The lady picked it out from what was in the storage.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>Perhaps he misunderstood due to their constant miscommunication. Perplexity clouded his normally composed face.</p>
<p>The awkward tension hung in the air like a heavy cloud over the dining table.  Woo-jin tried to break the silence.</p>
<p>“The rain has stopped, and the air is nice. How about going for a walk after dinner?”</p>
<p>“At this hour?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I have something important to tell you.”</p>
<p>Realizing that he had something to share, Hae-gang bit back on her lingering resentment. The two of them walked in silence on the quiet streets.</p>
<p>Taking a walk turned out to be a good decision. Just as Woo-jin had said, the air was crisp and clear, having washed away all the dust and impurities. Breathing in the refreshing air, Hae-gang felt rejuvenated.</p>
<p>Hae-gang playfully kicked a puddle on the clean path, where the clear rainwater had collected. The sound of her slipper-clad feet meeting the puddles and the splashes that followed created a lively rhythm. Her legs were occasionally splashed with the flying water droplets.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, following her slowly from behind, watched her with a bemused expression, unable to understand her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you give it a try, Min  Woo-jin? It’s quite refreshing and fun.”</p>
<p>“No, thank you.”</p>
<p>He firmly declined, avoiding the puddles as they walked. Seeing him being so cautious amused Hae-gang, and a cheerful laughter escaped her lips.</p>
<p>“What’s this? You always seemed like a person who only knew how to go straight.”</p>
<p>“This is a different case.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure, you must be a very cautious person.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s smile was evident, and she turned around to face  Woo-jin. With her pace adjusted to his, she stepped forward, leading with her heels, making the water splashes even more fun. Being her carefree self, Hae-gang stepped on puddles without hesitation.</p>
<p>Woo-jin couldn’t bring himself to laugh or smile. He knew that the words he was about to utter would be shocking, to say the least.</p>
<p>“Han Dawn…”</p>
<p>When he called her name, she gazed back at him, wearing the same radiant smile. But her cheerful expression wouldn’t last long.</p>
<p>“I received an invitation from TN. It’s for an event called ‘Night of Benefactors’ that’s held every two years. It seems like President Yoon Geon-ho will be attending too.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s feet, which were moving briskly, suddenly faltered, and Woo-jin quickly reached out to hold her arm to prevent her from falling. There was a peculiar silence between them, and Hae-gang was the first to break it.</p>
<p>“Oh? Is this your first time meeting that person?”</p>
<p>The tone of the conversation had become noticeably more awkward compared to earlier, but  Woo-jin appreciated her efforts to avoid creating an uncomfortable atmosphere. As Hae-gang was keen on avoiding a strained atmosphere, this was a welcome development for her.</p>
<p>“Passing by, I’ve seen him a few times, but this is the first time since Han Dawn came into my life.”</p>
<p>“I see. Are you nervous? Well, that person isn’t exactly known for his amicable disposition.”</p>
<p>“Han Dawnn-nn.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin interrupted her as she was trying to lighten the conversation with her own thoughts. Hae-gang, eager to keep the conversation light, found herself abruptly silenced. Perhaps it was because she had a sense of what might be coming, but an ominous feeling began to gnaw at her.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s hand, resting on her shoulder, tightened, and his lips trembled in anticipation of something. Despite her awkward response, he didn’t hesitate to continue.</p>
<p>“You will have to accompany me to that place as well, Han Dawn-n”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s face froze in plain view.</p>
<p><em>I’ve decided not to ask anything; I told you that</em>.</p>
<p>The words that had once been hovering on the tip of her tongue were no longer suitable for the current situation.</p>
<p>The status of Han Dawn no longer protected her from his prying eyes, and even though she knew that sooner or later they would inevitably clash, the prospect of such an encounter made her anxious.</p>
<p>What if they were led back to that cramped and stifling place? What if she was forced to meet someone, have a conversation with someone, and see only Yoon Geon-ho? The thought alone was suffocating. Just the imagination of it made her gasp for air.</p>
<p>Hae-gang bowed her head to the dirt and let out a breath, but her breathing was still constrained.  Woo-jin, seeing her like this, reached out and placed his hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>She raised her head honestly, shaking it gently. She thought she was handling it better than before, but the reality was different.</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s gaze was fixed on the path beyond Woo-jin’s shoulder. The dark alley left her with mixed feelings. There was the refreshing feeling of the unknown in the endless darkness, but there was also the fear of not being able to see even an inch ahead.</p>
<p>The thick darkness resembled the nightmares she had been having, and her heart felt heavy.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>On the night of the ‘Supporter’s Night’ event, Hae-gang looked at her reflection in the mirror, which showed her transformation in real time.</p>
<p>“I heard that you have burn scars on your face,” a staff member assisting with the makeup said.</p>
<p>“Jinyoung-ssi!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing the staff’s words, the shop manager quickly covered her mouth, realizing her mistake. The staff member’s face turned pale in response to the manager’s icy reprimand. Hae-gang quickly comforted her before she could become any paler.</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang faintly smiled at the staff through the mirror. With all the rumors circulating, it was natural for them to be curious.</p>
<p>“I’ve had the scars removed. I couldn’t just stay away from public activities forever.”</p>
<p>After finishing her makeup, a clothing rack was wheeled in. When the manager suggested a party dress that resembled a dress, Hae-gang shook her head.</p>
<p>Be prepared for any situation. She chose a women’s suit from the back of the prepared rack.</p>
<p>The outfit consisted of trousers that weren’t too tight, a blouse with a large pussybow as a focal point, and a jacket. It accentuated Hae-gang’s femininity as much as a dress would. Her short hair, which had grown out, was neatly tied up by a professional stylist, and the manager adjusted the jacket and overall fit.</p>
<p>“I’ll fold up the sleeves a bit, so the blouse peeks through slightly.”</p>
<p>“Oh, okay.”</p>
<p>At the manager’s request, Hae-gang carefully folded up her sleeves. She tried to keep the atmosphere from being too silent and occasionally made conversation.</p>
<p>“I was really surprised when CEO Min made the reservation.”</p>
<p>“Min Woo-jin, I mean, your husband doesn’t come here often.”</p>
<p>The manager continued to focus on the sleeves but answered kindly.</p>
<p>“Normally, he doesn’t attend parties frequently, and our events have separate sections for men and women. He came early this morning, picked out his clothes, and reserved in person. I could tell how much he values you just by hearing his voice.”</p>
<p>As the manager shared her story, Hae-gang’s gaze turned to the clock.</p>
<p>As the time to leave drew closer, Hae-gang felt her nerves tightening. She clenched her fists, pinching the palm of her hand repeatedly to quell the trembling. She even tried loosening the ribbon tied around her neck a bit, but it didn’t seem to have any significant effect.</p>
<p>In an attempt to calm her nerves, she closed her eyes and began taking deep breaths. It was then that a familiar voice reached her ears.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?”</p>
<p>When she turned around, she saw a dashing Woo-jinn standing there, more elegant than ever. With his hair brushed back to reveal a portion of his forehead, his handsome features shone brightly.</p>
<p>Hae-gang realized how much he didn’t care about his appearance, considering his shockingly good looks. His innate foundation and physique were already excellent, so she had never noticed his potential for elegance. As she stared at him, her manager answered his question.</p>
<p>“Yes, CEO Min. Mrs. Min is ready.”</p>
<p>As the voice echoed right beside her, Hae-gang snapped back to attention, forcing a smile. She tried to push aside her manager’s answer and create a pleasant atmosphere.</p>
<p>Amidst her thoughts, Wooyeon’s voice came again, tinged with a hint of laughter.</p>
<p>“Everything’s ready?”</p>
<p>She answered, still adjusting her appearance in the mirror, “Yes, everything is ready.”</p>
<p>As the evening continued, her manager prepared her for departure. Hae-gang straightened her tie, making sure she looked her best, and her manager approved of the final look.</p>
<p>“Looking good. I’m sure Mrs. Min will be proud of you.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin nodded and looked at her approvingly. He seemed to understand the significance of the occasion for Hae-gang.</p>
<p>“Shall we go, Miss Han Dawn?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s nerves were still there, but she had a sense of Woo-jin’s calming presence. She couldn’t help but notice how impressive he looked.</p>
<p>With his confident manner and impeccable attire, Woo-jin reached out his arm. The fragrance he wore was familiar to her—Silk of Sweet Flag, the perfume she had given him. The scent was fitting for him, possessing a sophisticated yet gender-neutral quality.</p>
<p>Woo-jin extended his arm, offering it to Hae-gang. She hesitated for a moment, letting her shaking hand grip his tightly for a moment before gently placing her arm on his. It had been a while since she last did her nails, but they sparkled under the light.</p>
