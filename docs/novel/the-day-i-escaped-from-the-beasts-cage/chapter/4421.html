            <p>Perhaps he could read the regret in her eyes. Woo-jin followed the guide and nodded as he moved inside.</p>
<p>“I’ll place an order for dinner, so come in for a while.”</p>
<p>If one follows their gaze, one can see the private pool. The lighting installed on the floor emphasizes the romantic atmosphere.</p>
<p>She passed by him with a not-so-bad offer and entered the resort first. Sandals hit the wooden floor in time with the sound of the river running.</p>
<p>Haegang, who changed into a bikini, came out wearing a thin cardigan. Woojin, who undressed faster than her, was leaning on the sunbed right in front of the pool, looking at his cell phone.</p>
<p>The arm muscles exposed by the sleeveless shirt and the wide shoulders caught her attention without even realizing it.</p>
<p>Sunset and Charlie in the Maldives. If one takes a picture, wouldn’t a picture with this name be born?</p>
<p>The picturesque background created by Woo-jin made her dazed. Hae-gang, who succeeded in clearing her mind by shaking her head, crept behind him. When she glanced at something, it was the same thing.</p>
<p>She stared at the back of his head with tired eyes and tapped his shoulder.</p>
<p>“How is it? I’m a bit embarrassed, but…”</p>
<p>Haegang asked Woo-jin without even looking at him. She picked the least exposed one out of all of them, but she wouldn’t be ashamed of that.</p>
<p>Still, it was a nonsensical statement that had nothing to do with asking for an opinion out of courtesy toward the person who bought it.</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>She pointed to the tube standing tall next to her. It was also large enough for two people to climb on it easily.</p>
<p>“Are you late to air it?”</p>
<p>Even if they were just empty words, saying something like “it suits you well” could add up, but their interest had already left me. Hae-gang pushed the tube into the pool and sat down with only their knees submerged.</p>
<p>“A must for non-swimmers like me.”</p>
<p>I rolled my feet and slowly splashed in the water before slipping into the tube.</p>
<p>To think of it, how did she get up here? Faced with an unexpected problem, Hae-gang risked her shame and looked to Woo-jin for help.</p>
<p>He’s strangely good at this. Woo-jin, who perfectly recognized what she wanted, moved closer to the pool, putting aside his cell phone. It would be great if he didn’t make that annoying face.</p>
<p>And Hae-gang turned her back on Woo-jin, startled.</p>
<p>“Oh, why are you taking off your clothes?!”</p>
<p>“Because it’s wet. Didn’t you want to ask for a ride there?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s right…”</p>
<p>She didn’t know he could take off his clothes so easily.</p>
<p>Her neck and shoulders stiffened with tension. It would be nice to do some warm-up before coming in, but she skipped even that and got in quickly.</p>
<p>She heard the sound of splashing water, and Woo-jin’s strong arms grabbed her waist.</p>
<p>“Come on, three.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s words were cut off midway. Hae-gang looked back at the behavior that was not like him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Woojin Min?”</p>
<p>“Ah, after thinking about the past for a while, it goes up to three.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s arm, which was holding her waist, gained strength. Hae-gang’s face became hot at the sight of him, which was conveyed through Pine’s back. It’s embarrassing to think of her body being exposed to him because of her upturned hair.</p>
<p>In the end, Hae-gang, unable to handle the situation, quickly turned around.</p>
<p>“Mr. Woo-jin Min! I’ll do it myself.”</p>
<p>The words didn’t come to an end. The words that came out of Woo-jin’s face, which was closer than necessary, went into it. He wrapped around her waist completely, as if she were uneasy as she stumbled around.</p>
<p>As their eyes crossed, Hae-gang still couldn’t read Woo-jin’s intentions.</p>
<p>He looked down at Hae-gang in silence, counting along with Hae-gang’s voice that he heard a long time ago. He stopped involuntarily, feeling regret for not winking at her, but instead asking for it with words.</p>
<p>Even so, he could tell that her heart was throbbing just like it had the first time they met. The way she rolled her eyes here and there, as if confused, was just as lovely as it was that day.</p>
<p>“The human heart is so deceitful,” he thought.</p>
<p>On the first day he met Hae-gang, he believed that since he had seen her body once, he wouldn’t be able to set his eyes on it again, but it was a hasty decision. Her white and transparent skin reflected the vermilion light as if she copied the sunset, and her cheeks were dyed peach in a strange atmosphere.</p>
<p>The scars that caught his eyes as if passing by and made him comment, ‘It’s not nice to look at,’ were eaten up by the current atmosphere and came to be thought of as a pattern.</p>
<p>Where is that? The neckline and shoulder line revealed by raising the head gave off a precarious feeling as much as they were delicate, and the bouncy chest was tempting enough to make him want to touch it right away.</p>
<p>His gaze slowly lifted and landed on Haegang’s lips. The vibrant red color, as if biting off a petal, stimulated his desire.</p>
<p>Everything looked different just because this woman was Seo Hae-gang.</p>
<p>“Ms. Dawn,” he called out.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Woojin watched as Hae-gang blinked once. Her slowly curled eyelashes trembled and returned to their original place.</p>
<p>He gave strength to his arm that was wrapped around her waist as she trembled aimlessly against him. He felt guilty for not knowing what to say to her, but such thoughts were quickly blown away by the fresh citrus scent that spread from her.</p>
<p>“Let’s have a good mood today,” he said before their lips collided in an instant.</p>
