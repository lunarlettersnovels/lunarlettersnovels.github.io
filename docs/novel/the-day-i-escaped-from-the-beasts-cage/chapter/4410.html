        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>It was a little after 8:00 when Woo-jin arrived home, greeted by the darkness of the night despite the arrival of spring. As he removed his shoes with his back towards the sensor light, a figure suddenly appeared in his field of vision. It was Hae-gang, who peered out and withdrew back inside before he could say anything.</p>
<p>Once he had finished removing his shoes and entered the house completely, Woo-jin found himself drawn to Hae-gang’s hair.</p>
<p>“How would you like to cut your hair? How is it?” he asked, studying her head with a sense of curiosity.</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s black hair had a slight grayish tinge to it, almost as if it had been sketched with a pencil lead. After a moment of contemplation, Woo-jin found the right words to describe it.</p>
<p>“It looks like titanium,” he commented, running his hand through her hair.</p>
<p>Hae-gang took a step back at his sudden touch but didn’t seem to mind as he continued to feel her hair between his fingers. The texture was somewhat brittle, perhaps due to the effect of dyeing, but Woojin found himself drawn to its urban feel. He concluded with honesty,</p>
<p>“It suits you well,” he said, admiring how her short hair complemented her pretty features.</p>
<p>Hae-gang seemed surprised by his comment. “Really?” she asked.</p>
<p>He couldn’t deny the feeling that he was failing his mission to keep his distance from her, as if she were a wild animal he was trying to tame. But comparing her to any creature would not do justice to her unique charm.</p>
<p>He knew that giving compliments and making physical contact would increase affection and intimacy, but it was worth it if it meant seeing Hae-gang smile more often. Of all the people he knew, her smiling face suited her the best.</p>
<p>“Why are you staring at me like that, embarrassing people?” Hae-gang asked, her neck turning red from his gaze. Woo-jin lowered his head, feeling a bit ashamed.</p>
<p>“Did you go outside today?” he asked, changing the subject.</p>
<p>“No, I was only at home. But I want to go out soon! Do you really think no one will recognize me?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s face was aglow with anticipation, and her voice was filled with excitement. Moments before, she had avoided making eye contact, claiming to be embarrassed, but she had quickly shifted her mood. Nonetheless, Woo-jin found this change endearing, and he brushed her hair while asking a question.</p>
<p>“Did you do your hair yourself?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang responded, “Auntie did it. Did you know she’s a hairstylist, Minwoo Jin?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin narrowed his eyes, trying to recall if he had heard this information before. Yeoju’s family had taken care of the housework since her parents’ passing, and Woo-jin was unaware of the housekeeper’s past experiences.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t know. That’s surprising.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang explained, “I was going to cut it myself, but it turned out messy, so Auntie helped me fix it.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin appreciated hearing Hae-gang’s voice following him, updating him on her daily routine. He suspected that she intended to share everything that had occurred throughout the day since she talked nonstop. Before, only the sounds of his own life filled his empty home, but now it felt full.</p>
<p>Woo–jin was delighted with this change, and the thought of three years later when Haegang would no longer be around made him feel lonely.</p>
<p>When he lived alone, only the sound of his life floated around. But after she came in, it felt like his house was full. Only one person has increased. He is quite happy with this change. Imagining three years later when Hae-gang is not here anymore makes him feel lonely.</p>
<p>Hae-gang followed Woo-jin eagerly as he headed toward the dressing room. As he turned around to look at her, she nearly crashed into him, causing him to stop suddenly.</p>
<p>“Ah,” Woo-jin said as he held his body, leaning forward. “I’m surprised sometimes. You’re taller than I thought. This is how I realize that your shoulders are in a higher position than I thought.”</p>
<p>When kissing, you don’t have to lean as much as you might expect, even in the Maldives.</p>
<p>Woojin’s mind wandered off, and he felt his neck grow sore from watching the day’s video. He quickly cleared his head and said something that Hae-gang would welcome.</p>
<p>“It’s good timing that you’re ready to go outside.”</p>
<p>“…?” Hae-gang responded, looking confused.</p>
<p>“Sometime tomorrow, Mr. Saebyeok shall be receiving the vehicle,” conveyed Woojin. Hae-kang’s response was delayed, and her shoulders rose as if it took a moment to comprehend.</p>
<p>“Are you implying that you’re gifting me the car now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, do not hesitate to drive it. It’s rather peculiar that Charlie’s hostess relies on public transportation,” remarked Woojin with a smile.</p>
<p>Hae-kang’s widened eyes and the hand covering her mouth revealed her delight. Her affection for the car made her want to reciprocate the kindness.</p>
<p>Woojin struggled to stifle his grin. “Can you drive?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps?”</p>
<p>“What kind of an ambiguous response is that?”</p>
<p>“I used to drive, but that was more than two years ago. I suppose I shall have to practice a bit,” replied Hae-gang in a faltering voice.</p>
<p>As her voice trailed off, her head drooped, and Woo-jin’s gaze followed her downcast eyes. He noticed her twisting the hem of her nightgown anxiously.</p>
<p>He wondered if Hae-gang felt pessimistic about not being able to drive. Just as he pondered how to console her, she spoke up.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. What did you say?”</p>
<p>“Could you help me practice driving when you’re free?” asked Woojin in a barely audible voice, hesitant to impose.</p>
<p>Woo-jin nodded confidently when Hae-gang consented. “Sure, weekdays are a bit tough, but we can start practicing on weekends.”</p>
