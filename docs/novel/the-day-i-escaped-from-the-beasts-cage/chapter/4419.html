            <p>His fingers tapped the chair. In the silence of the president’s office, an exceptionally loud ringing sound choked Jaemin’s breath.</p>
<p>As if pondering something, “his” fingers stopped for a moment, and “his” mouth finally opened.</p>
<p>“His fingers must be small too.”</p>
<p>Jaemin felt as if all the blood had drained from his body.</p>
<p>He knew because he had been with “him” for quite some time. Unlike his half-brother, who put something in his hand, that person was easy to take away.</p>
<p>And Jaemin’s thoughts were exactly right.</p>
<p>“From now on, if you speak nonsense that isn’t what I’m asking, I think your son’s fingers will go out one by one.”</p>
<p>“President, please!”</p>
<p>“One at a time.”</p>
<p>His gaze evaded Jaemin’s and turned back. A man with a ferocious expression, who had been in the room for some time, nodded at his glance.</p>
<p>“I’ll answer! I’ll answer. So, my son!” Jaemin, crawling on his knees and holding onto his crotch, lowered his head as if he were about to touch the ground. However, he brushed Jaemin off as if removing a leech from him and sat with his legs crossed. Jaemin rubbed his hands together, feeling like he had to do something because his only son was fading in front of him.</p>
<p>“From the previous question, how much did you tell me about that man?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I even told you about Min Woo-jin’s car, which was filmed on CCTV. Other than that, really!” Jaemin answered.</p>
<p>Other than that, if it even came out about Min Woo-jin’s car, it was as if he had taught him everything. He hated to admit it, but his half-brother had a good brain.</p>
<p>“Then he must know. Seo Hae-gang might have gotten into Min Woo-jin’s car,” he said.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Even though the woman who married Min Woo-jin might be Seo Hae-gang,” he continued.</p>
<p>Jaemin couldn’t answer. In fact, every single word that stuck in his head was true. Just as he was about to loosen his tie, suffocating from the air pressing down on him, his hand came in ahead of him. His eyes darkened as he pushed up the knot enough to tighten his neck.</p>
<p>“Kek, kek!” It was only when Jaemin was about to run out of breath that he let go of the tie and leaned back to enjoy the softness of the chair. There was still a chill in Jaemin’s eyes as he looked at his flushed face.</p>
<p>“You know what I’ve done with those bastards who leaked their secrets.”</p>
<p>Jaemin’s eyes widened at the tone mixed with arsenic. He looked at Jaemin’s pupils, which were shaking uncontrollably, and made an expression of satisfaction.</p>
<p>“I will be relieved, though. Even without you, your son will be raised well,” he said.</p>
<p>At his gesture, the man standing motionless next to the door dragged Jaemin by the scruff of his neck. An animal-like sound came from Jaemin, who was terrified.</p>
<p>“President! Save me, save me! President!!” Despite the sound that was close to screaming, he didn’t even frown. To him, the steps of his half-brother were more important than Jaemin’s future.</p>
<p>He pressed the call button, and a calm voice came over. “Yes, boss.”</p>
<p>“Make a schedule as soon as CEO Min’s honeymoon is over,” he said.</p>
