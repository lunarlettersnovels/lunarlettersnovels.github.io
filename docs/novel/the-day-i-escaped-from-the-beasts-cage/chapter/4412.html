        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>Hae-gang sat alone at the table, her phone disconnected after an unsuccessful call. The once inviting table, set for two, now felt empty and desolate. The clatter of her utensils echoed loudly in the vast space, a stark reminder of her solitude. Hae-gang pushed her food aside, her appetite lost, and let out a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>Her thoughts drifted back to a few hours ago, when she had desperately sought reviews on her phone. Frustration had led her to stand in front of the bathroom mirror, clutching a pair of hairdressing scissors she had impulsively ordered online. Hae-gang examined her reflection, trying to gauge how much length to trim off her waist-length hair.</p>
<p>“Just cut it off?” she contemplated aloud, debating whether to go for a drastic change. After much contemplation, she finally mustered the courage and made a decisive snip with the scissors. The bathroom floor was soon littered with a mess of long strands.</p>
<p>As she looked at her reflection in the mirror, Hae-gang felt a sudden rush of coolness. But her satisfaction was short-lived as she realized the uneven, zig-zag lines of her haphazard attempt at cutting her own hair. Tears welled up in her eyes as she touched the botched ends, feeling regretful and defeated.</p>
<p>Just then, there was a knock on the door. It was Yeoju, the housekeeper, who had come to check on Hae-gang.</p>
<p>“Madam, what are you doing?” Yeoju asked, clearly puzzled by the scene before her.</p>
<p>Hearing the worry in her voice, Hae-gang quickly opened the door, and her trusted housekeeper, showed concern as she examined her head. With a surprised expression on her face, Yeoju couldn’t help but take charge, guiding her to sit down in front of the dressing table as if she couldn’t bear to see her in distress.</p>
<p>“If I was going to cut my hair, I would have liked to go to a hair salon,” Hae-gang murmured hesitantly, mindful of the neighborhood they were in.</p>
<p>The housekeeper, ever practical and sensible, quickly changed her approach. “Then, shall I show off my skills after a long time?” she suggested, picking up a comb from the dressing table and grabbing the scissors with confidence.</p>
<p>“Do you know how to beautify?” Hae-gang asked, curious about her expertise in hairstyling.</p>
<p>“I thought I could do it until about 15 years ago,” Yeoju replied, a twinkle of mischief in her eye. “That is enough.”</p>
<p>With Hae-gang’s permission, the housekeeper set to work, skillfully trimming her hair and making it look much better than she had expected. As she worked, Hae-gang couldn’t help but be impressed by her housekeeper’s deft hands and keen eye for detail.</p>
<p>Once the haircut was complete, the housekeeper suggested dyeing Hae-gang’s hair for a complete makeover. Hae-gang was surprised to learn that the housekeeper had also brought hair dye along with her scissors. She quickly fetched the dye from the bathroom and expertly draped a plastic sheet around Hae-gang to protect her clothes.</p>
<p>As they worked on the dyeing process, Hae-gang couldn’t help but feel a sense of excitement building up inside her. She had always been conservative with her appearance, but now she was taking a bold step to change her look. The housekeeper reassured her with her calming presence, and she found herself trusting her completely.</p>
<p>Finally, the dyeing process was complete, and Yeoju carefully washed Hae-gang’s hair to reveal the final result. Hae-gang was amazed at the transformation. The new hair color suited her perfectly, and she couldn’t help but smile as she looked at herself in the mirror. She thanked the housekeeper profusely for her skills and creativity, feeling grateful for her unexpected talent in hairstyling.</p>
<p>With her fresh haircut and new hair color, Hae-gang felt like a new woman. She felt a renewed sense of confidence and adventure, all thanks to the impromptu makeover orchestrated by her trusted housekeeper. She couldn’t wait to show off her new look to the world and see where this newfound sense of boldness would take her. Little did she know that this small change in her appearance would set off a series of events that would forever alter her life’s trajectory, all thanks to the remarkable skills and ingenuity of her talented housekeeper.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The repast was quite satisfactory, indeed. The fare was commendable, owing to its subtle salinity, and the presentation was meticulous, with nary a smudge to mar the culinary canvas. While Woo-jin entertained the thought of bringing Hae-gang here sometime, the seafood offerings scattered here and there prompted him to seek out other options. And so he pushed the plates aside.</p>
<p>“Oh, I mentioned it to you over the phone, but congratulations on your nuptials. How was your honeymoon?” Sun-woo began the small talk.</p>
<p>“It was lovely. We heeded your recommendation and went to the Maldives,” came the polite reply.</p>
<p>As Woo-jin faced him head-on, his countenance was Janus-like. Outwardly, he exuded a cool aura, yet he was adept at sporting an array of expressions, even flashing a smile that appeared distinctly human.</p>
<p>“Ji-woo took a shine to President Min, actually, but alas,” Sun-woo lamented. “It’s embarrassing to admit, but I can’t help but factor in my sister’s status. I’m more intrigued by the wife who’s managed to meet CEO Min’s lofty expectations.”</p>
<p>“My wife is ordinary. I based my decision to wed on character rather than pedigree, and I don’t believe it was a misstep,” Woo-jin replied, carefully choosing his words so as to be unidentifiable.</p>
<p>Although Woo-jin’s demeanor could be tantalizing, Sun-woo simply smiled, revealing no emotion.</p>
<p>“The more CEO Min speaks, the more curious I become. If your wife is hesitant to venture out due to her scars, I can introduce you to a reputable physician who specializes in that field, albeit cautiously,” Sun-woo offered.</p>
<p>“That’s a decision my wife must make, so I’ll ask her,” Woojin responded.</p>
<p>“Please convey my eagerness to meet her,” Sun-woo requested, and the words felt like more than mere pleasantries.</p>
