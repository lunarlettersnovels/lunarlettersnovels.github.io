            <p>He made everything up. The survivor, Hae-gang, was declared dead, put on a respirator, and moved out of the operating room and into a hotel right away. In the process, he filled the pockets of those who came into contact with Hae-gang to keep secrets, and some who failed to keep their mouths properly shut paid a price accordingly.</p>
<p>He didn’t feel guilty about it. Even if he killed a few people and crippled a few, it was fine as long as it wasn’t the Hae-gang. It was all just for her. He thinks he’s trying to deny it.</p>
<p>In that way, he was going to hide Hae-gang from anyone’s eyes and live her whole life in his arms, if for no other reason than purely for her safety.</p>
<p><em>But why are you so uncooperative?</em></p>
<p>He, who put Hae-gang’s old favorite wine on the table, brought out two glasses. A nearly purple-red wine fell with a refreshing sound. He, who picked up his own wine glass of the two, sat on the sofa and stared hard somewhere in the air.</p>
<p>“It’s a scar.”</p>
<p>Min Woo-jin’s wife said she had a scar on her face. But he can’t believe it without seeing it in person.</p>
<p><em>She is a suspicious person.</em></p>
<p>After shaking the glass to form a small bubble, “he” takes a sip. Due to the low-dose wine, it only leaves a bitter taste, but there is no feeling of drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Hae-gang didn’t even drink much of this. Maybe it’s because she’s vulnerable to alcohol, but even if she drinks a couple of glasses, her face quickly turns red, and she becomes more winsome.</p>
<p>“Oh, my.”</p>
<p><em>Is that why she didn’t drink?</em></p>
<p>Realizing again why Hae-gang didn’t even touch alcohol during the two years she stayed here, “he” made a small laugh.</p>
<p>That’s why he’s afraid she’ll do that good thing under the influence of alcohol. It was just like Hae-gang to be stubborn in useless areas.</p>
<p>He, who drank the remaining wine, savored the taste and looked funny.</p>
<p><em>Let’s bring her back and have her drink. I don’t know if that’s going to happen.</em></p>
<p>Judging that it was a good idea, he put down his empty glass and unbuttoned his shirt. The solid copper-colored muscles were illuminated indoors, making them even shinier.</p>
<p>He tapped the glass with his finger as it was filled. The glass that fell under the table did not break because of the quality carpet, but the soft carpet was stained.</p>
<p>Seeing the rapidly spreading stain, he got up from the sofa and went into the bathroom without hesitation.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>It was such a stain that if you threw it away tomorrow, there would be no trace left. The same is true of Hae-gang. If he finds her somehow and puts her back in here, there won’t be a trace of her running away.</p>
<p>His eyes glowed sharply after being hit by water falling from above.</p>
<p>To do that, she shouldn’t be the woman who married Min Woo-jin. He doesn’t like to bother others.</p>
<p>“Ms. Dawn, are you really scared of flying?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin replaced what he wanted to say by looking around her in an innocent way, as if he really didn’t know why.</p>
<p>“You don’t have a lot of luggage. Why are you so packed? The house is turned upside down.” Of course, she was to blame for being so excited.</p>
<p>When Hae-gang went to the Maldives in midsummer weather, she remembered that he brought only winter clothes. So she got advice from Han and prepared some clothes to wear there, including a bikini, and that was the source of trouble.</p>
<p>The process of packing seemed endless as she threw her favorite items into her suitcase and filled it with clothes taken out of shopping bags. What was unnerving was that his expression remained unchanged even though he appeared to be in a hurry.</p>
<p>She had a serious look on her face as she surveyed the clothes as if it were a necessary process rather than just a fuss. When he asked if she usually packed her suitcase so easily, she nodded her head, still holding clothes that looked almost identical in both hands.</p>
<p>“I tend to enjoy the unique excitement when I pack my suitcase. In the past, I used to take two or three suitcases as a standard,” she said.</p>
<p>But as she spoke, her words gradually lost their momentum, as if it were annoying to keep talking to him. Perhaps memories of her twenties weren’t pleasant, or maybe she just wanted to relive them because of her current happiness. Whatever the reason, her initial excitement faded quickly.</p>
<p>Woo-jin watched her sit in the middle of the chaotic living room, leaning against the wall that led to the kitchen. He silently took the cup from her hand and drank from it. Hae-gang subtly looked in his direction and criticized him in her own way.</p>
