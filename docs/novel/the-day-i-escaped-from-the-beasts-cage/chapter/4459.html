            <p>“Eat slowly,” Woo-jin instructed as he placed the eggs on Hae-gang’s rice. “You need enough physical strength to go out and face reality.” Hae-gang rolled her eyes at Woo-jin’s words, feeling frustrated that he always had to remind her of her current situation. She tried to hide her emotions and wondered if she had developed a tolerance for his attitude.</p>
<p>As Hae-gang sat at the table, struggling to eat with her left hand due to her right arm being in a cast, Woo-jin noticed her difficulty. “What’s the problem?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing,” Hae-gang replied, trying to brush it off. “I’ll eat it on my own, so you can go now.”</p>
<p>But Woo-jin didn’t leave. Instead, he sat across from her and watched her closely. “Well, you can start eating now,” he said. “Didn’t you say you’d eat on your own? I’ll wait until you finish.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang looked at Woo-jin in surprise, feeling embarrassed that he was watching her struggle to eat. She hesitantly picked up the spoon with her left hand and tried to scoop the quail eggs, but had difficulty doing so. Seeing her struggle, Woo-jin grabbed the chopsticks and placed the eggs on top of her rice for her.</p>
<p>Hae-gang tried to scoop the quail eggs with her spoon but was unable to do so with her left hand. Woo-jin noticed her struggle and grabbed the chopsticks, placing the eggs on top of her rice for her.</p>
<p>“You’re good,” Hae-gang said sarcastically, but she couldn’t help but thank him.</p>
<p>She wondered why he was doing this, but couldn’t bring herself to ask. Woo-jin seemed just as uncertain, with a grim expression on his face as he arranged the side dishes evenly on the table. When he pushed the abalone dish toward her,</p>
<p>Hae-gang softly said, “Not that.”</p>
<p>“Speak up,” Woo-jin replied.</p>
<p>“I can’t hear you.” “Not that, but quail eggs, please,” Hae-gang said, feeling embarrassed that she had to request a specific dish. Woo-jin’s hand stopped in midair as he looked at Hae-gang with a hint of pity.</p>
<p>“I don’t like seafood,” Hae-gang said quietly, unable to meet his gaze. Woo-jin placed more quail eggs in her bowl, and Hae-gang looked down in embarrassment.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>In the office, Secretary Lee was recounting the day’s schedule to Woo-jin, who looked bored. Secretary Lee noticed his lack of interest and hesitated before speaking. “Who is it this time?” Woo-jin asked, wanting to hear the information directly rather than sifting through unnecessary details. Secretary Lee, who had been with Woo-jin for a long time, wasn’t embarrassed by the situation, which had happened more than once before.</p>
<p>“It’s Ki-woo, Daesan, and Moon Ik.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who was not paying much attention, raised his eyebrows at an unexpected name.</p>
<p>“Moon Ik? If it’s Moon Ik–”</p>
<p>“It’s Yoon Ji-woo.”</p>
<p>Moon Ik Group is a company known in Korea. Each Korean household would have at least one of its products.</p>
<p>“Reject everything,” said Woo-jin.</p>
<p>However, for Woo-jin, the popularity of the Moon Ik Group did not concern him. Charlie Inc. is still on the rise, and Woo-jin was cautious in building partnerships with other companies because he found them unnecessary. Furthermore, Woo-jin had no intention of getting married yet.</p>
<p>Although he had no justifiable excuse to refuse their offer, Woo-jin was adamant.</p>
<p>However, despite his firm refusal, Secretary Lee did not agree so easily.</p>
<p>“Even Moon Ik?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Even if it’s Moon Ik, the two brothers above will make it anyway, so is there anything to look forward to?”</p>
<p>Yoon Ji-woo, the eldest daughter, has two older brothers: Yoon Gun-ho, of automobiles, and Yoon Sun-woo, of steelworks. Only Yoon Gun-ho is the son of the chairman’s wife, so it’s easy to figure out who will take over if Chairman Yoon steps down. Of course, Yoon Sun-woo will never back down easily.</p>
<p>And on that bloody battlefield of a family, only Yoon Ji-woo was playing around without a thought of the future. She is in charge of hotels among Moon Ik’s affiliates but has not made any significant achievements since she took office. In the end, the partnership with Yoon Ji-woo was simply not an advantage.</p>
<p>Above all, his first love was once part of that family.</p>
