            <p>The moment Hae-gang saw Woo-jin’s face, tears gushed out, finally released after holding them back for so long.</p>
<p>Whatever Seon-woo had just told her didn’t matter anymore. What mattered was that Woo-jin was here with her now.</p>
<p>But instead of explaining the situation or showing concern, Woo-jin had a dissatisfied look on his face and asked an odd question.</p>
<p>“Are you lost, wandering around without finding your way home?”</p>
<p>Perplexed by his words, Hae-gang quickly wiped her tears and attempted to respond, stumbling over her words between sobs.</p>
<p>“No, it’s… um…”</p>
<p>“Just go straight down the road behind me, then turn right. You’ll find a familiar path. Go back and ask someone to get you an ice pack. Why the sad face?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin briefly touched her cheek and withdrew his hand, his expression even more unhappy.</p>
<p>His irritated eyes shifted to Seon-Woo, standing behind her.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why you’re looking at her like that. She’s here. CEO Min told you.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why your hand is on another man’s wife’s face.”</p>
<p>A smirk formed on Woo-jin’s lips. Hae-gang nervously bit her dry lips, sensing the tense atmosphere around her.</p>
<p>She couldn’t bring herself to look at Seon-Woo and instead grabbed onto Woo-jin’s collar. With a cool gaze fixed on Seon-Woo, Woo-jin spoke to her.</p>
<p>“Why are you still here?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go together, let’s leave together. What…”</p>
<p>She timidly attempted to pull at the collar, hoping to persuade Woo-jin to follow her. Yet, her efforts proved futile as he effortlessly released himself from her grip. He then motioned toward Seon-Woo and spoke.</p>
<p>“After I resolve the matter I promised, I will join you. Let’s have lunch together today. We can address your concerns then.”</p>
<p>“But what about him?” she pleaded, her voice filled with a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>“You are my esteemed guest. Just a moment,” Woo-jin replied, his gaze fixed upon Hae-gang’s flushed and swelling cheeks.</p>
<p>A lingering unease began to settle within her, making her reluctant to press the issue further. She couldn’t shake the fear that things might take a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>Worse? The concept seemed incongruous with Woo-jin, who was known for his composed and tranquil demeanor. Yet, as she observed the turmoil etched upon his face, doubt cast its shadow upon her thoughts. He stood rooted in place, as though held captive by his own thoughts, before finally releasing a weary sigh.</p>
<p>“It would be impolite to keep a valued customer waiting for an extended period,” he said firmly.</p>
<p>His words left little room for further argument. Gathering her resolve, Hae-gang took a heavy step forward, her heart burdened with trepidation. Before venturing further, she mustered the courage to pose one final question to Woo-jin.</p>
<p>“I must be here within thirty minutes. I’m famished,” she said, her voice a mix of desperation and determination.</p>
<p>He regarded her with a touch of amusement, and at that moment, he nodded. Finally, she glimpsed the Woo-jin she knew so well.</p>
<p>“Very well.”</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>Hae-gang disappeared around the corner, leaving Woo-jin to approach Seon-Woo. As he drew near, his face contorted with displeasure, stopping just a breath away from Seon-Woo’s reach.</p>
<p>Seon-Woo, oblivious to the tension in the air, offered a gentle smile and shook his head. “CEO Min was even more audacious than I had anticipated. How dare you snatch away a man of letters?”</p>
<p>“Moon Ik’s acquaintance?” Seon-Woo inquired.</p>
<p>“The woman who just fled. From the West Sea,” Woo-jin replied, ignoring the question and focusing on his own agenda.</p>
<p>“President Yoon Geon-ho mentioned something similar today. I cannot simply make excuses and stay in one place, relying solely on the support of my brothers.”</p>
<p>As Geon-ho’s name was mentioned, Seon-woo’s expression hardened, as though concealing his true emotions behind a smile.</p>
<p>Woo-jin paid little mind to Seon-Woo’s reaction. His own mood had soured considerably, leaving no room for consideration beyond his immediate concerns.</p>
<p>“By the way, can you provide solid evidence? Evidence of his ties to Hae-gang?” Woo-jin asked, his voice tinged with skepticism.</p>
<p>“What’s so difficult about that? Simply find a photograph from my brother’s wedding, and her face will be etched into the air. Can CEO Min successfully conceal it? Especially from Moon Ik?” Seon-Woo retorted, a hint of disappointment coloring his tone as if he found the topic mundane.</p>
<p>However, Woo-jin’s countenance remained cool and composed. He disregarded Seon-Woo’s reaction, focusing instead on imparting a reality that needed to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>“Mr. Yoon,” Woo-jin began, his voice low but firm.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Min,” Seon-Woo responded, his eyebrows faintly furrowing, caught between sarcasm and genuine curiosity.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you are unaware, given your intelligence, but I will remind you nonetheless, for it seems you may be forgetting,” Woo-jin uttered, taking a step closer to Seon-Woo, his words delivered in hushed tones.</p>
<p>“The revelation of my wife’s true identity isn’t the only vulnerability that President Yoon Geo-ho possesses. While it may serve as a weapon in their family feud, in a broader context, it would tarnish the company’s reputation,” Woo-jin declared, his voice resolute.</p>
<p>Yoon Geon-ho and Yoon Seon-woo are the two contenders vying for the chairman’s seat. Only one of them would be able to claim the prestigious plaque adorning the office. Consequently, they engaged in a constant battle of wits, each trying to outmaneuver the other while keeping a watchful eye on Chairman Yoon’s decisions.</p>
<p>“It would be unwise for you to remain out of Chairman Yoon’s sight. It is preferable to expose this secret through a third party,” Woo-jin advised his words hanging heavily in the air.</p>
