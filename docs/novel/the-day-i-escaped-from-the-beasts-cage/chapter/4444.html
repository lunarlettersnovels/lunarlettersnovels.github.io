<p>Meanwhile, Woo-jin sighed as he looked down at the secretary’s number on the screen.</p>
<p>Hae-gang appeared hesitant to confess her identity. She might have concluded that she couldn’t trust him just yet.</p>
<p>It wasn’t without regret, but he understood. Woo-jin’s finger tapped the wall against which he was leaning.</p>
<p><em>So, what should we do from here on out? If I told you I knew who your husband was, I think you’d flee.</em></p>
<p>Woo-jin, who couldn’t come to a decision, punched the call button just as the tone was cut off.</p>
<p>“Oh, why?”</p>
<p>“Did you have a girlfriend, Mr. CEO?”</p>
<p>“What kind of nonsense is this?”</p>
<p>But, to begin with, the cell phone was continually vibrating. With calls flowing in from all over, Secretary Lee’s statements did not appear to be nonsense.</p>
<p>“Wait a second.”</p>
<p>When Woo-jin removed his cell phone from his ear, he pressed “Reject” as soon as he spotted an unsaved number. He’s not sure if he should save the number or not.</p>
<p>“Tell me now.”</p>
<p>However, the vibration persisted. Woo-jin frowned at the cell phone screen once more. It was a text bomb this time. Text messages kept coming in even though all of his personal connections seemed to have been cut off.</p>
<p>He eventually gave up and just listened to Secretary Lee’s voice on the phone.</p>
<p>“What exactly did you say?”</p>
<p>“The CEO’s article was published on the portal website. It’s a photograph of a woman.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s face was irritated for a brief moment. He put down his phone to read the article, but he can’t wait to hear a voice telling him to do so.</p>
<p>“Are you paying attention, CEO?’</p>
<p>“Wait a second, don’t hang.”</p>
<p>He put the secretary on standby and opened a portal site window for most domestic users. It didn’t even take much effort to find it. It was stuck on the main page.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who clicked on the article, bit his lips.</p>
<p>The first thing he looked for was a snapshot of Hae-gang’s face. He is a well-known person, but she is not. He planned to sue the reporter if she was ever revealed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Woo-jin cannot sue the publication. Hae-gang’s face could not be seen since it was attached to his back like a turtle’s shell.</p>
<p>Is it because he was well versed in Hae-gang’s true identity and the predicament she was in? She wouldn’t even tell him her name because she was too wary, and her body appeared too desperate.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who was staring at the television with an uneasy expression, headed to the doctor’s office. Meanwhile, he was giving secretary Lee instructions on what to do in the future.</p>
<p>Secretary Lee, who was on the cell phone, even misinterpreted whether Woo-jin desired the circumstance.</p>
<p>“First, talk to the reporter and ask him to take the story down.” The picture showed the name of a certain hospital. Tell him to get off, no matter what. and write a reply essay from our perspective.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Should I fix it if I tell the reporters she’s merely a close friend?”</p>
<p>“No. “She is more than a girlfriend; she is my future bride. CEO Charlie Min Woo-jin intends to marry before the end of the year.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>For a brief while, Woo-jin appeared dissatisfied with the thunderous scream.<em> Why can’t she grasp it at first, and why does she make me repeat it?</em></p>
<p>The secretary sputtered in surprise.</p>
<p>“Are you certain you want to marry?”</p>
<p>“What’s the issue?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all! No worries.”</p>
<p>After knocking, he quickly opened the door to the doctor’s office and cut off the call. The doctor, who was about to tell him to come in, seemed surprised.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, CEO Min?”</p>
<p>“All of a sudden, I’m sorry. “My patient should be dismissed.”</p>
<p>“She can leave the hospital, but why all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin set down his cell phone, which was holding a photo of the doctor’s desk. His finger was hidden beneath Hae-gang’s thick coat.</p>
<p>“The hospital’s name has been revealed. Please say no if they are looking for this woman. “It’s true there was a woman who went missing, but it wasn’t her.”</p>
<p>“Do you believe someone will surely show up?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Perhaps a recognizable face.</p>
<p>As Woo-jin was thinking about Hae-gang’s husband, the doctor swept his chin and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Okay. “She’s already in the hospital without necessary procedures, so get her out right now.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin turned around after a brief, snowy greeting to confirm the time. It’s been a while since the piece was published, so it’s time for reporters to congregate. She needed to get out of here before that happened.</p>
