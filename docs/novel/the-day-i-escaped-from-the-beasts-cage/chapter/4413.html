            <p>Woo-jin, who recently returned from his honeymoon, found himself entombed in a deluge of work. With a hand that held a pen of dulled wit, he signed document after document, wondering just how many times he had done so that day alone. His ears, too, were occupied, straining to catch every word uttered by the parade of secretaries that shuffled in and out of his office. Rest was a luxury he could not afford; at that moment, his mouth was required to give instructions.</p>
<p>“Tell the planning team to prepare for the meeting in 30 minutes. I need a proper explanation,” he instructed sternly.</p>
<p>Recently, Charlie has been focusing on portals, and only the planning team was being divided into new fields as two portals were already established in Korea. Woo-jin frowned, thinking of how impossible it was to intervene there in some way.</p>
<p>“Again?” he asked, raising his head to look at Secretary Lee.</p>
<p>She shook her head and said, “No, sir.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. We’ll have as many meetings as we need—ten or twenty times. This secretary just delivers,” he grunted in response.</p>
<p>As Secretary Lee left the room, Woo-jin loosened his firm body, relieved to be free from the pressure of his role. But before he could even stretch his stiff shoulders, there was another knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Come on in,” he said.</p>
<p>This time, it was Han who entered, informing him of his schedule for the day. “CEO, there is a dinner table with CEO Yoon Sun-woo at 6 o’clock.”</p>
<p>“What about Yoon Gun-ho?”</p>
<p>“Next Monday at eleven,” she replied.</p>
<p>Woo-jin nodded, glad for the opportunity to meet Yoon Sun-woo and organize his thoughts. He tried to focus on his work, but he couldn’t help noticing Han’s presence as she stood there, waiting for his response.</p>
<p>Woo-jin put down his pen and looked up at Han. “Do you have anything to say?” he asked.</p>
<p>Han smiled in response. “Did your wife like the bikini I chose for you?” he asked, his voice filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>Woo-jin could tell that Han had put a lot of thought into choosing the bikini. The day before he left, he had seen Han standing on the balcony, gazing out at the sea with two bikinis in his hands.</p>
<p>Woo-jin hesitated before answering, but finally said, “He complained about it.”</p>
<p>Han’s smile faltered for a moment, but then Woo-jin quickly added, “But I’ve been wearing it and I think I like it.”</p>
<p>Relief flooded Han’s face, and he bowed neatly before leaving the representative’s office with light steps, looking elated that his shoulders were lifted.</p>
<p>Woo-jin was finally able to have some time alone, so he spent the rest of his time reviewing the plan. When he finished, he stood up and headed to the meeting room.</p>
<p>The meeting turned out to be longer than expected, and it didn’t end until after five o’clock. When Woo-jin came out first through the door opened by Secretary Lee, he checked the time and hurried his steps. The faces of the remaining people in the conference room were thickly covered with dark circles.</p>
<p>Secretary Lee handed Woo-jin the coat he had brought in advance from the representative’s office, and he immediately headed to the main gate, where the car was waiting. Even though the meeting place was not far, it was rush hour, so Woo-jin closed his tired eyes as the car started.</p>
<p>Suddenly he remembered something and took out his cell phone. “Oh,” he said out loud. “I have to contact Hae-gang. I said I’d go home after dinner.”</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment, but then decided to call instead of texting. When Hae-gang answered, Woo-jin asked, “Have you had dinner?”</p>
<p>“No, not yet,” Hae-gang replied. “I’m going to eat with you when you come.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin felt sorry for a moment, but then realized he had a dinner appointment. “I don’t think I can eat with you tonight,” he said. “Don’t wait, eat first.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s voice was calm and understanding. “Okay. Thanks for calling. I almost waited without a promise.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin felt a twinge of guilt, but quickly said, “No, don’t skip it, and make sure you eat.”</p>
<p>“I will. Min Woo-jin, come home safely.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Woo-jin said before the call ended.</p>
<p>He couldn’t shake off the feeling of being uncomfortable, but before he could figure out why, the car arrived at the meeting place. When he entered the store, an employee recognized him and guided him to the room.</p>
<p>Woo-jin raised his wrist to check the time before opening the sliding door. “You’re here, Mr. Min,” the man inside said, getting up to greet him.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, CEO Yoon Sunwoo,” Woo-jin replied, shaking his hand.</p>
