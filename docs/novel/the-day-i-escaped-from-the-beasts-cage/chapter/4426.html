            <p>The next morning, she didn’t want to open her eyes to the softness surrounding her body. After holding out like that, she remembered where she fell asleep last night and took her face off the pillow she was burying breathtakingly.</p>
<p>Hae-gang raised her head and looked around, but Woo-jin was nowhere to be found. It was almost nine o’clock when she looked at her desk-mounted electronic watch. He seemed to have already come to work.</p>
<p>However, as if to break her expectations, the sound of someone stepping on the stairs got closer. Hae-gang, who dropped her head on the pillow again, closed her eyes before the door opened.</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe that she was showing up like that in the evening after yesterday morning. She was too embarrassed to face Woo-jin’s face.</p>
<p>Coming in with the smell of fragrant coffee, he went straight to bed. With the movement getting closer and closer, her heartbeat seemed to be getting louder.</p>
<p>A hand was placed on Hae-gang’s forehead and then withdrawn as if it had completed its task of checking her temperature.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s voice spoke, saying, “I know it happened.”</p>
<p>Feeling embarrassed, Hae-gang buried her face in the pillow, hoping Woo-jin would leave. However, he seemed to have something to say, and his gaze was directed toward her.</p>
<p>Realizing she couldn’t keep him waiting any longer, Hae-gang timidly asked why he was doing what he was doing.</p>
<p>Woo-jin spoke with his eyes, touching his ears and neck to convey meaning. The sweat from the night before had cooled and become sticky.</p>
<p>Woo-jin seemed to mistake her hesitation for drunkenness and said, “Tell me when you wake up completely. We will talk then.”</p>
<p>But Hae-gang insisted, “I broke everything. I have something to say.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin raised his hand, which had been moving busily, on his lap and signaled that he was ready to listen. He wanted to give it a break, then got straight to the point.</p>
<p>“How about a honeymoon destination, the Maldives?”</p>
<p>“The Maldives?”</p>
<p>Why did he have to suggest that place? It was where Hae-gang went on a honeymoon with “him.” Even though she was reluctant to answer, Woo-jin calmly waited.</p>
<p>When his coffee was half gone, Hae-gang was able to articulate her words. There was something more important than the destination being the Maldives.</p>
<p>“I’ll be honest, the word travel blinded me yesterday, and I didn’t think about it, but I don’t know if I can get on a plane properly.”</p>
<p>She hadn’t ridden a plane since the accident that day, so she couldn’t guarantee that she would be able to do it. But it was true that she was reluctant.</p>
<p>“Can’t you catch a plane?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s face changed subtly as if her ambiguous answer made him feel frustrated again, so he quickly added an explanation.</p>
<p>“You remember the area air crash that happened two years ago, right?”</p>
<p>“I remember. Because it was talked about on the news for days and days. Come to think of it,”</p>
<p>Hae-gang looked into the distance for a moment, as if she were recalling a memory from long ago. But that was only for a moment.</p>
<p>“You were riding there.”</p>
<p>Their gazes collided in midair. Hae-gang wasn’t too surprised that Woo-jin knew who she was.</p>
<p>The day she came out of the hospital, from the moment she asked a question related to Moon-Ik, she expected that this moment would come sooner or later. Since there were only two candidates, it would have been easy to recognize them.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I haven’t ridden it since, so I can’t say for sure.”</p>
<p>At her words, Woo-jin looked somewhat troubled. Maybe it was a headache, but even she was worried about the hand that was touching the eyebrow area.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“I wonder if that’s why he recommended it.”</p>
<p>“He recommended the Maldives?”</p>
<p>a name she couldn’t even come up with. Hae-gang called it vaguely, feeling like her mouth had made a big mistake just by spitting it out.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was nothing that Woo-jin couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>“Hae-gang, you must board the plane. If you don’t, it’ll only fuel their suspicions,” Woo-jin said firmly, placing his glass down on the table as he looked at her cynical expression.</p>
<p>Hae-gang scoffed at the thought.</p>
<p><em>Love?</em></p>
<p>It was impossible for someone like Sun-woo Yoon to love anyone. He and his whole family were monsters, the Moon-Iks.</p>
<p>Woo-jin seemed to understand the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure how he came to that conclusion, but I’m certain he’s suspicious,” he said after a brief moment of silence.</p>
<p>Hae-gang nodded in agreement. But the idea of boarding a plane filled her with anxiety. She hadn’t been on a plane since the accident and wasn’t sure if she could handle it.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s expression grew serious.</p>
<p>“You have to do it,” he said firmly. “If you don’t, it’ll only make them more suspicious.”</p>
