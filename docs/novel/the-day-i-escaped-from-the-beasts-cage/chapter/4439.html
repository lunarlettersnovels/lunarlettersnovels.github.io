            <p>Woo-jin’s words poured laughter from the Hae-gang River onto the table. Woo-jin’s expression was disturbed by the same laughter as Hae-gang River’s in his memory. Not seeing him, Hae-gang was still busy calming down the twitching corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>Woo-jin didn’t speak informally in the first place, but speaking like that made her curious. Hae-gang peered into Woo-jin’s face when she saw the opportunity.</p>
<p>“What were you going to call me?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin still needs to answer.</p>
<p>The body of the Hae-gang leaned forward along with the desire to listen. As a result, the loose neck part slightly popped up, and Woo-jin had to try not to pay attention to it on purpose.</p>
<p>As if to avoid answering, Hae-gang’s small hand slipped out of her sleeve and touched Woo-jin’s shirt. It was such a timid contact that Woo-jin didn’t know if she felt it or pretended to handle it.</p>
<p>“What were you going to call me?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who half covered his face with a coffee cup, stared at her without saying anything.</p>
<p>The waiting answer was not intended to be heard, but it was embarrassing to be excited alone when he was facing the gaze that had been staring for a long time.</p>
<p>With an awkward expression, she bit her body, which she had pulled tightly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I was a little distracted when I was working.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that,”</p>
<p>The glass, which had been used to cover his face while pretending to drink coffee, fell on the pedestal; this time, Woo-jin pulled his back on his arm.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to see you smiling like that,” Woo-jin said.</p>
<p>Hae-gang sat in silence, trying to compose herself after the unexpected compliment from Woo-jin. She couldn’t help but feel self-conscious and embarrassed, but at the same time, she couldn’t deny the warm feeling that spread through her chest. She had always struggled with self-esteem, and it wasn’t often that someone made her feel appreciated and valued.</p>
<p>As she sat there, lost in thought, Woo-jin continued to work on his tablet, seemingly unaware of the impact his words had had on Hae-gang. She couldn’t help but wonder what he was thinking, but simultaneously, she was hesitant to interrupt him.</p>
<p>After a few moments, Woo-jin looked up from his work and caught Hae-gang’s eye. He hesitated for a moment, as if trying to decide whether or not to say something, and then finally spoke.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to make you feel awkward. I just wanted to let you know that I think you have a very pleasant and attractive smile. You should smile more often.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang was taken aback by Woo-jin’s sincerity and felt her cheeks flush with embarrassment. She wasn’t used to receiving compliments, especially not from someone she barely knew. But at the same time, she couldn’t deny the warmth that spread through her chest at Woo-jin’s words.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she managed to stammer, still flustered. “I’ll try to smile more.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin nodded and returned his attention to his work, and Hae-gang sat quietly, still feeling a little overwhelmed by the exchange. She couldn’t believe that she had just received such a kind and genuine compliment from someone she barely knew, and she couldn’t help but feel a little bit giddy as she tried to process it all.</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>Sun-woo was scrolling through his cell phone, looking at an article about Woo-jin’s upcoming wedding, when Geon-ho walked in and sat down in front of him. There was a tense atmosphere between the two brothers, who didn’t even bother to say hello to each other. Sun-woo got straight to the point, addressing Geon-ho with cold eyes.</p>
<p>“You said something ridiculous to Ji-woo.”</p>
<p>Geon-ho shrugged off the comment, not surprised that Sun-woo had brought it up. The two brothers were the same age, with the same father but different mothers. Geon-ho chuckled at the accusation.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Did I say something that wasn’t true?”</p>
<p>Sun-woo glared at him. “I’m talking about your claim that his wife’s the only secret.”</p>
<p>Geon-ho’s eyes narrowed at Sun-woo’s cutting remark. Sun-woo, not backing down, continued with an air of superiority.</p>
<p>“We have a secret between us that should never be revealed to anyone else. Let’s make sure to play fair.”</p>
<p>Geon-ho’s face became strained as he closed his eyes before opening them again. He didn’t try to hide his annoyance.</p>
<p>“This is why I hate parasites. They latch onto things they know nothing about.”</p>
<p>Sun-woo’s face twisted in disgust at Geon-ho’s flippant attitude. He couldn’t stand the ease with which Geon-ho carried himself. Sun-woo’s finger tapped against the glass in his hand.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>Hae-gang looked at Woo-jin with a surprised expression. It was such a simple and sincere reason that it touched her.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said softly, looking down at the card again.</p>
<p>Woo-jin nodded, a small smile on his lips. He seemed happy that Hae-gang liked the name he had given her.</p>
<p>“Well, Han Dawn. From now on, that will be your name.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang nodded, still looking at the card. It was a strange feeling to have a new identity. But she had to get used to it, for her safety and for Woo-jin’s as well.</p>
<p>She looked up at Woo-jin and smiled.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Woo-jin. I’ll try my best to adapt to this new identity.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin smiled back and nodded.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’ll do great. And if you have any problems or concerns, don’t hesitate to ask me for help. I’ll be here for you.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang nodded, grateful for Woo-jin’s support. She knew she could rely on him, which made her feel more at ease.</p>
<p>He stood up and held out his hand.</p>
<p>“Well, Han Dawn. It’s nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin chuckled and took her hand, shaking it firmly.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you too.”</p>
<p>They smiled at each other, both feeling a sense of hope and determination for the future. Together, they would face whatever challenges came their way, ready to take on the world as a team.</p>
