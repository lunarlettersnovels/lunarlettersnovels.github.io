            <p>She didn’t know who the secretary was assisting, but she felt obligated to dissuade him at least once because she thought it would be unfair to be fired for this.</p>
<p>“Why do you cut other people’s livelihoods with this? Don’t do that,” she said, but Woo-jin didn’t respond to her as he didn’t sympathize with her very much. As if it were a serious matter, Hae-gang was jealous of his expressionless face, raising her tension.</p>
<p>“It feels soft, and the color is pretty! The rabbit here… isn’t it cute? How can I dress up and make myself feel…” she said, as her voice crawled.</p>
<p>“Don’t you like it?” Woo-jin asked as she hesitated momentarily, taking two pajamas in her hand. What Woo-jin said belatedly was utterly unexpected.</p>
<p>“First, let’s wash and wear it. It takes less than two hours to dry, so please wait,” he said. As for Woo-jin, wearing it in the first place was not a problem; he was just reluctant to wear clothes that had never been washed.</p>
<p>He was a neat man to the bone.</p>
<p>Waiting for the pajamas to dry was not dull for Hae-gang, as she lost track of time observing Woo-jin. He couldn’t let go of his cell phone, just like she had a few hours ago, but it was completely different when she looked inside. Woo-jin had contacts.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m Min Woo-jin,” he said, as he answered the call.</p>
<p>All in all, he was in a rush. He held phone calls for about two minutes at the shortest and for about 10 minutes at the longest, and the topic of all conversations was “marriage.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who had filed a marriage registration that afternoon, received such huge congratulations that he thought his cell phone might explode. It wasn’t until a long time later that he realized Hae-gang was blinking so that she wouldn’t be disturbed, so he went into the study, nodding his head as if he were sorry. Hae-gang, who was left alone, looked at her quiet cell phone.</p>
<p>She realized it wasn’t just him who had recently married, which was unfortunate<em>.</em> Woo-jin came out of the study looking exhausted after hearing that the dryer was running. It was as if he had been nagged, not congratulated.</p>
<p>Hae-gang took out her pajamas from the dryer and looked at Woo-jin with his fluffy pajamas on the table side by side. Still, his cell phone was urging him to be contacted.</p>
<p>Looking at her cell phone with fed-up eyes, Woo-jin took off his pajamas with a little nervous touch.</p>
<p>For a moment, Hae-gang sighed softly as the study door closed again, even though she thought they would wear rabbit pajamas together.</p>
<p>“Who would congratulate me?” she thought, as it was ambiguous to say that.</p>
<p>As Hae-gang reached that realization, she finally understood Woo-jin’s feelings.</p>
<p>“It’s not something to be congratulated on, but you must be tired of receiving it constantly,” she said, as she couldn’t overcome the depression and looked at her toes endlessly. Suddenly, her cell phone rang with a text notification sound.</p>
<p>Hae-gang, who blinked a couple of times, opened the message window with useless excitement.</p>
<p>[Congratulations on your wedding]</p>
<p>It was a hard celebration without a single emoticon.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was an illusion that someone’s voice was playing on the letter.</p>
<p>“Save, this is my number.”</p>
<p>It was that voice.</p>
<p>She curled her lips, which were trying to pout, and raised her head.</p>
<p>This man has a beautiful ability. It was not explained in words other than the ability to touch her tear point accurately.</p>
<p>After quickly blinking her eyes to get rid of the tears she wanted to hold, Hae-gang turned her head toward where she could hear his voice. And instead of crying, she burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Haha, really.”</p>
<p>It was cut off by laughter, but what she was trying to say was clear.</p>
<p>It doesn’t look good on you, Woo-jin.</p>
<p>He was wearing the same pajamas as her.</p>
<p>He pointed to his pajamas, which he had swept down his top several times as if he were embarrassed.</p>
<p>“You change, too, Ms. Dawn,” he said,</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say let’s at least feel good?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang, who nodded, quickly entered the room in her pajamas.</p>
<p>Taking off Woo-jin’s loose T-shirt and wearing pajamas, she looked at herself in the mirror. When she thought of Woo-jin wearing the same clothes outside, she felt like a real newlywed.</p>
<p>She knows the reason he wore pajamas that he didn’t have to wear was to comfort her. As always, she was grateful, and she was grateful again this time.</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>As she timidly opened the door and left, his eyes caught her.</p>
