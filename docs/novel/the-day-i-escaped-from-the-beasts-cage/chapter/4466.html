        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>“Cover your face first,” the person who had been staring at her for the longest time remarked, nodding as if he had made up his mind. “I will lead you.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang put on the cap that the man held out without saying anything.</p>
<p>“I’m with you, madam. The elevator is most likely out of commission. Only visitors staying in suites or higher have access to emergency stairs, so I’ll check there. “Please, don’t even think about it,” he said as he stared down on her.</p>
<p>Hae-gang felt out of breath as soon as she entered the room’s entrance. Her whole body shook with anticipation and nervousness, not just her legs.</p>
<p>Her steps began cautiously and quickly grew urgent. She checked the floor where the elevator had stopped as soon as she passed it. It was the twenty-first. It has been informed that guests are encouraged to use the emergency steps in the event that the elevator fails.</p>
<p>Hae-gang struggled for breath. She had not exercised in the two years she had been imprisoned, so her body eventually gave way. The soldier quickly grabbed her wrist and dragged her away.</p>
<p>As they descended the stairs, more and more people streamed out. Hae-gang struggled to maintain her equilibrium as she was swept up by the crowd. She tightened her grasp on the railings and counted the floors each time. Her heart rate increased as they approached the 20th floor.</p>
<p>When they arrived on the 20th floor, Hae-gang, who had constantly checked the floor number, shook off the man’s hands and dashed to the emergency exit.</p>
<p>“Ma’am!”</p>
<p>She heard an urgent call but did not turn around. She pushed her way through the mob and into the elevator. Hotel security was searching the hallways to evacuate the guests when they discovered her in the elevator.</p>
<p>“Get off, Madam!” It’s not secure!” Someone yelled.</p>
<p>They attempted to stop her, but the elevator door closed before they could approach her. The elevator, contrary to what the man claimed, functioned normally.</p>
<p>In the rumbling elevator, Hae-gang clenched her eyes tightly. She has no regrets, even if she dies alone inside. She hoped she’d make it to the first level in one piece.</p>
<p>Ding!</p>
<p>Hae-gang exhaled the breath she had been holding for twenty floors as she lifted her shaking eyelids at the cheerful voice announcing her arrival on the first floor. Hae-gang peered through the open door.</p>
<p>“Stay out of my way!” Please move out of my way!”</p>
<p>“Please excuse me! Let’s take the lead!”</p>
<p>“Argh! “Why do you push people away?”</p>
<p>The first floor was a complete mess. Hae-gang couldn’t even move as she peered at the crowds swarming the entryway.</p>
<p>“…People,” mumbled Hae-gang.</p>
<p>Strangers, not him or the guards who were watching her. Hae-gang understood how many people there were in the world. There was only him and her in her universe back then.</p>
<p>She would have stood for a long time watching the crowd if it hadn’t been for the elevator notification that the door was shutting. Hae-gang regained consciousness and exited the elevator, making her way to the cafe on the first floor. Her steps were unaffected by reluctance.</p>
<p>Hae-gang was already familiar with the hotel’s layout, having been in and out several times before being imprisoned by the devil. This cafe, in particular, stays open till late for the convenience of its customers.</p>
<p>She gazed around the cafe after creeping in, holding her breath. Nobody was around; perhaps everyone had already evacuated.</p>
<p>She bolted for the rear door. The rear door was a corridor via which personnel arrived and exited. She could leave without going through the front door.</p>
<p>Hae-gang couldn’t help but be frozen as soon as she opened the door leading to the outside, transfixed by what she saw. She had desired to be outside for so long.</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>Hae-gang threw away the hat that had partially obscured her vision and glanced around joyfully as if she had transformed into a child.</p>
<p>The trees shook in the heavy wind. The dampness of the snow-covered ground. A cat’s faraway cries. The sound of engines roaring. The dazzling lights. There were so many things she had forgotten, so many things missing from the 28th-floor suite. When she inhaled, frigid air entered her lungs. She had also forgotten how she felt because the room was constantly kept at the same temperature, whether it was summer or winter.</p>
<p>Suddenly, furious noises broke her silence.</p>
<p>“What the hell happened to her?”</p>
<p>“Did you double-check who was leaving the front door?”</p>
<p>They were not far from discovering her based on the fact that their chat was readily audible. Hae-gang hastily covered her mouth with her hands. For a while, she had to put aside the exhilaration of finally leaving the hotel. They might be able to track her down.</p>
<p>Hae-gang dashed into the night, expecting to taste the sweet freedom.</p>
