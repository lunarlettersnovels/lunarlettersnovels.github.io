            <p>Woo-jin dashed in as the door flew open. He said this as he took off his coat.</p>
<p>“Get ready to leave the hospital immediately.” “We should get out of here.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang was perplexed when the person who was going out to answer the phone suddenly appeared to be in a rush.</p>
<p>He did, however, pack her slip and cardigan in the closet without much explanation. Hae-gang, who was barefoot on the floor, watched Woo-jin’s every action with her eyes.</p>
<p>“What exactly is going on?”</p>
<p>Woo-jin covered her head with his coat instead of responding.</p>
<p>“I forgot to bring my padded jacket.” Let’s do it this way. Hurry up and wear your shoes.</p>
<p>Woo-jin unlocked the hospital room door and took the lead, holding hands without reluctance. The Hae-gang had to be hauled away without knowing what was happening.</p>
<p>She felt out of breath despite the fact that she hadn’t traveled far as she followed Woo-jin, who walks with a long stride. With a slender frame devoid of muscles, it was difficult to keep up with his steps.</p>
<p>When the sound of her shoes rang, Woo-jin slowed down a little because he realized she was walking twice as fast as he was.</p>
<p>“Your physical power is…”</p>
<p>She moaned as he tried to say something. Hae-gang clenched her teeth and moved her knees as she realized another cruel word was about to come out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Fortunately, an elevator connects the VIP wing to the underground parking lot. When they went to see the sea, they used this.</p>
<p>Hae-gang, who was in the elevator, exhaled heavily while gripping the handle.</p>
<p><em>Why she I wasn’t exercising the whole day when I was locked up?</em> Her second year felt insignificant.</p>
<p>“How did you get from Rudy to that road?” “You couldn’t possibly have taken a taxi.”</p>
<p>Even if he asked her that, he’d have no idea it was her. She immediately ran forward that day, believing she had to live somehow.</p>
<p>People are correct when they claim that if they desire to live, they can do anything. Now that she thinks about it, she realizes it was a true miracle. Hae-gang, who was replying nonchalantly, suddenly discovered something and glanced at Woo-jin with her rabbit eyes wide open.</p>
<p><em>Rudy…</em>Min Woo-jin simply said, “Rudy.”</p>
<p>“How are you supposed to…?”</p>
<p>She was so taken aback that she couldn’t finish her sentence. Woo-jin, who was looking at the rapidly shifting statistics, responded casually.</p>
<p>“It’s everyone’s dream, but it happened to be a place where they could escape that day.” “Rudy is the only one around.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang spits out its breath. Her mind was tangled like a thread, and she couldn’t think of anything.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the elevator approached the underground parking garage. Woo-jin gazed at her reflected in the door after taking his gaze away from the number representing the floor. She seemed to possess him with her gaze.</p>
<p>“You are not required to respond to this question.”</p>
<p>The elevator door, which doubled as a mirror, opened, cutting off the sight she encountered through it.</p>
<p>But Hae-gang didn’t think about going down until Woo-jin grabbed her hand again. He just stared blankly at his back, letting go of her legs, which moved as she was guided.</p>
<p>Woo-jin went forward quickly and posed a question. in a low voice, as though inquiring about everyday well-being.</p>
<p>“Is it the husband you’re fleeing, Moon Ik?”</p>
<p>Her mouth was sewn shut, and it didn’t open at all. But by not answering, Woo-jin seemed to achieve the answer he desired.</p>
<p>Hae-gang recognized that the time she had predicted had arrived sooner than she had anticipated. She did a good job of practicing before. She would have died without being able to apologize if she hadn’t done it.</p>
<p>“Sorry. “I apologize, Min Woo-jin.”</p>
<p>“It is fine.” “I was speculating.”</p>
<p>“Still… ”</p>
<p>“Did you not hear me?” “I simply stated that I was speculating.”</p>
<p>Isn’t there a distinction between an estimate and certainty? Hae-gang flexed her fingers as she became restless.</p>
<p>“If you’re concerned about your relationship with Moon-Ik, remember what you stated in the hospital earlier.”</p>
<p>It’s a risky marriage, so if he doesn’t want to do it, he doesn’t have to, and she wants to say she won’t do it or hate it, but even that didn’t work out.</p>
<p>To be honest, he was hoping she wouldn’t accept the offer.</p>
<p>This marriage was a lifeline for him. He lacked the confidence to stand upright on his own, avoiding the shadow he had pledged to cast.</p>
<p>When he stretched it without finishing his words properly in his messed-up thoughts, he nailed it first.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to use it as an excuse to bite off what I previously recommended, so don’t even think about retreating.”</p>
