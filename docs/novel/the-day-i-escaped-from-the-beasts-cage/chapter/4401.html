        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p>Woo-jin didn’t consider himself particularly imaginative, but from the voice alone, a distinct image began to take shape in his mind. It conveyed a strong presence.</p>
<p>He recalled a photo he had seen in an online article. Although he couldn’t recall the details precisely, he remembered the owner of that resonant voice having a refined appearance.</p>
<p>Matching the voice on the other end of the line with the Yoon Geon-ho he had seen in his memory, Woo-jin extended his greetings without hesitation.</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’m hearing your voice directly. It’s a pleasure to meet you, CEO Yoon Geon-ho.”</p>
<p>“As busy individuals, let’s get straight to the point.”</p>
<p>Woojin had expected to be asked why he had canceled their appointment. With rumors circulating about Yoon Geon-ho’s difficult personality, he had prepared himself to offer a polite apology in case the question of ignoring Moon-Ik came up. However, Yoon Geon-ho had delved into an entirely different matter.</p>
<p>“Are you familiar with Hae-gang?”</p>
<p>Even Woo-jin, who had rarely been caught off guard in his life, found himself surprised. Such a direct question, mentioning the name of his deceased wife, whose death was officially recorded.</p>
<p>This meant that Yoon Geon-ho was certain about Woo-jin’s involvement with Hae-gang. Unconsciously, Woo-jin loosened the knot in his throat and responded with a perplexed voice.</p>
<p>“Hae-gang…”</p>
<p>Know or not to know.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s gaze drifted towards the desk clock, wondering if it was the time when she would be caught up in the excitement of going out. Her tendency to be a bit scatterbrained made him consider the possibility that she might have left their home in disarray. The burden of cleaning up would fall on the poor housekeeper. His thoughts even wandered to the point of contemplating whether he should raise her salary. However, a voice from the other end of the receiver abruptly interrupted his musings.</p>
<p>“My wife’s name.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin put down his pen and delicately smoothed out the furrow between his creased brows. He had been aware that she was Moon-Ik’s daughter-in-law, but hearing it spoken by someone else brought about a novel sensation, one that didn’t evoke pleasant feelings.</p>
<p>“I read about it in an article. the Aeria Airlines plane crash incident.”</p>
<p>“Is that all?” came the voice on the other end, laced with a slightly slower tempo, conveying a sense of intimidation. However, it had little effect on Woo-jin.</p>
<p>The voice resonated with a somber tone, as if scraping against the depths, combined with deliberate slowness to exude an air of intimidation. Yet it failed to have a significant impact on Woo-jin. He possessed an innate resilience. Regardless of any threats imposed or the manner in which airplanes were boarded, he had the uncanny ability to maintain his composure—a quality that propelled him forward amidst the densely intertwined realm of well-established conglomerates.</p>
<p>“I have no personal acquaintance,” Woo-jin stated firmly. “Is there a reason for your inquiry?”</p>
<p>What he knew was Han Dawn, not Se Hae-gang. Ms. Dawn was a distinct individual, different from Hae-gang, who bore the weight of the world’s misfortunes. Although she lacked culinary skills and had limited driving ability, she possessed the rare ability to offer a refreshing smile—one that adorned a truly lovely countenance. Though their interactions had been minimal, Woo-jin had already classified Geon-ho and Sun-woo as belonging to entirely disparate categories. Their approaches diverged significantly. While one sought to breach his home’s security system in search of Haekang, the other was the type to recklessly plant bombs without forewarning.</p>
<p>“It appears as though my deceased wife has returned to life.”</p>
<p>As anticipated, Woo-jin couldn’t help but release a subtle chuckle in response to the brusque demeanor. The other party reciprocated with a chuckle of their own, laden with irony. Nonetheless, both of them remained silent for a while, clutching onto their respective receivers. They understood, without the need for words, the sentiments they wished to convey to each other.</p>
<p>Geon-ho was the one to break the tension-filled silence.</p>
<p>“What should I do if my wife has returned, CEO Min?”</p>
<p>Min hesitated for a moment. “Well…”</p>
<p>Woo-jin, already dropping the formal title, had no intention of delving into such personal matters. Yet, as he began to respond, his voice seemed to carry weight, as if pressed down by something.</p>
<p>“I intend to capture that person by any means necessary, to ensure they never leave my side again.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin briefly closed and opened his eyes, nodding in agreement.</p>
<p>“Then you’ll need to gather your strength, as it won’t be an easy task.”</p>
<p>Woo-in’s words carried a clear message: Yoon Geonho would not succeed in reclaiming Se Haekang.</p>
<p>Geon-ho seemed to grasp the implied meaning without any evasion.</p>
<p>“I have no qualms about difficult tasks, CEO Min. If there are any obstacles in the way, I’ll eliminate them.”</p>
<p>If they were face-to-face, Geon Ho might have been met with a stern gaze.</p>
<p>A further conversation seemed unnecessary. As a formality, Min was about to end the call after exchanging pleasantries, but Geon-Hos’s words resounded, resolute and weighty.</p>
<p>“CEO Min, let us avoid encountering each other in unfavorable circumstances.”</p>
<p>And the call abruptly ended.</p>
<p>Woo-jin brushed away the fringe that tickled his forehead and finally let go of the lingering thoughts about the phone call, fully immersing himself in the morning’s work. He settled comfortably into his chair, recalling the conversation that had just taken place.</p>
<p>It was a conversation devoid of truth, but there was one thing that resonated within Geonho’s words: if there were obstacles in his chosen path, he would swiftly remove them rather than avoid them.</p>
<p>That was his preferred approach, and it was also the reason for orchestrating the meeting between Sun-woo and Hae-gang today.</p>
<p>He believed it was the right course of action—until he saw the red fingerprints on Hae-gang’s face.</p>
