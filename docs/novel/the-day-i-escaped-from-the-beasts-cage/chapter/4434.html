        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a chilly morning, and the darkness had yet to dissipate when Hae-gang woke up. She sat in bed reading articles about their upcoming wedding. The previous night, Woo-jin had called his secretary and ordered him to publish an article announcing that they would donate all the money they would have spent on the wedding instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the internet is still filled with praise for Charlie today. Thinking about Woo-jin, who had been inundated with congratulatory phone calls until late the previous night, Hae-gang got out of bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang donned her pajamas and left the room, being careful not to drag her slippers on the floor. Even though they were now legally married, she still had to do her share of the housework. An hour later, however, she found herself in the middle of a cluttered kitchen with a disastrous expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cooking is difficult,” she muttered as she looked at the recipe she had found online. Despite following the instructions, the food could have been better. In a small but certain sense of despair, Hae-gang could not bring herself to look at the mess in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you doing?” Woo-jin’s voice came from behind her, causing Hae-gang to straighten her back and puff out her chest to hide the messy kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Hae-gang’s efforts, Woo-jin had already seen the kitchen’s state. Eventually, Hae-gang gave up hiding and had to tell the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel like I have to do something,” Hae-gang said, trying to explain her actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin looked around the messy kitchen with a proud face, but his words were not kind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think I can do anything,” he said as he frowned upon seeing the boiling soup on the stove.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His reaction hurt Hae-gang’s feelings. It’s weird from how it looks, but is there a need to frown so clearly? However, Hae-gang couldn’t say anything because she had become timid due to the failed cooking. She just listened to his sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s like wanting to crawl into a rat hole. Even the smell of soybean paste in the kitchen felt terrible. Hae-gang could only chew on her dark lips as she thought she had done something useless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry, I should have told you in advance. Coffee will do for breakfast.” Woo-jin said, putting a capsule in a coffee machine that occupied a kitchen corner. It was the moment when the morning fuss became pointless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang turned off the stove and looked at the still-bubbling soup. The more she looked at it, the less ashamed she felt. It didn’t look delicious, but she had to change her mindset and recommend it to others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, when Woo-jin went out, Hae-gang smoothed her neck with the thought of eating and cleaning alone. It was a little hot, perhaps because of the embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s someone working,” Woo-jin said as if answering a question Hae-gang hadn’t brought up. She had been living in this house for days but hadn’t seen anyone like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He explained that a heavy-mouthed man had come in and told him not to come for a while. He said that if Hae-gang were anxious, he would tell him not to go in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang didn’t know what to say, she wasn’t anxious about meeting others, but she couldn’t nod immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it was impossible to manage this large house with her abilities. She had tried to challenge it with courage, but it had been determined in an hour this morning that she couldn’t do it alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t want to make Woo-jin uncomfortable by living alone, so she said, “No, I don’t think I can do it alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin decided that Han Sae-book would take care of the housework in the future, so Hae-gang wouldn’t have to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then what should I do?” Hae-gang asked, wondering about her new role in the household.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang’s disappointment was evident as she nodded to Woo-jin’s words, which seemed to brush off the subject. The characters had grown tired of feeling directionless and wanted to know what Woo-jin expected of them. To clarify the situation, Hae-gang asked, “Then what do you want me to do, Min Woo Jin?”</span></p>
