            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Truly wondrous,” thought Hae-gang as she realized she had never seen Woo-jin indulge in a drink before. He had always been content with coffee himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why did you ask me to drink?” Woo-jin’s voice was almost a whisper, and Hae-gang couldn’t help but notice how uncomfortable he looked even trying to take a nap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin’s sensitivity to even the slightest touch was on full display, even in his sleep. Hae-gang had to be cautious not to accidentally poke or prod him, for fear of embarrassing him or making him uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know that Woo-jin, who knew his drinking capacity well, had eventually succumbed to the idea of drinking and sleeping, despite his exhaustion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang checked on him and saw that his face had turned a shade of red that could only be attributed to drunkenness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t help but think to herself, “How could someone be so vulnerable to alcohol?” She knew she didn’t have the strongest tolerance for it either, but Woo-jin was on another level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe just two sips. Or three?” Hae-gang mused, surveying the amount of alcohol spilled on the floor. But as she took a sip, she began to feel her head heat up with an urgent thirst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Woo-jin’s hair gently brushed against her, Hae-gang couldn’t help but notice how good it smelled. Maybe the feverish feeling she had wasn’t just due to the alcohol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I must be crazy,” she thought to herself, feeling her face flush with embarrassment. She settled into a comfortable position, knowing that she wouldn’t be able to move Woo-jin on her own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But less than an hour later, her mind changed completely. The wind blew through her thin clothes, making her shiver uncontrollably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Min Woo-jin, wake up,” she whispered urgently, shaking his body gently. His eyes fluttered open, and he blinked rapidly, as if trying to dispel his sleepiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang couldn’t help but notice how hot his breath was on her shoulders, and how fast his heart was beating. She felt his burning shoulders against hers, and for a moment, it was as if they were the only two people on the deserted island.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voice was so close that it made Hae-gang’s ear itch. Woo-jin’s words were slow and muddled, but she managed to understand them. It was cold, but she knew his shaking was not caused by the chill. Hae-gang stood up, holding onto Woo-jin’s arm firmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, let’s go inside. We’ll both catch a cold if we stay here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, Woo-jin was able to stand upright without swaying, but walking was a challenge. It wasn’t that he was heavy, but there was something else that made it difficult to explain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they made it to the bed, Hae-gang dove in with Woo-jin. The bed creaked noisily with the sound of springs as they settled in. Hae-gang clung to the bedsheet and clenched her teeth to keep from falling off Woo-jin’s arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just sober up, please,” she urged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin turned his head as if he had heard her voice in his sleep. His breath felt too hot, too close to her face. And then she felt it—the hot sensation of his hand touching her cheek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait. Wake up,” she whispered, unable to finish her sentence. The sensation of his fingers tracing her eyebrows was strange and unsettling. From the awkwardness to the itchiness, nothing felt easy. Hae-gang closed her eyes tightly and waited for the moment to pass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin’s lips were hotter than last time, and his kisses were intense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin, who pressed Hae-gang’s shoulders, which rose as if a current had been connected, sat on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single dress didn’t have to be taken off for long. The touch of sweeping down the shoulder line while putting it under the string made Hae-gang dizzy, and the stimulus was too strong everywhere his lips touched, even though they haven’t started anything yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang closed her toes with a thrilling sensation that felt more than necessary. His lips drifted away, leaving a thin, solid line, but he was unlikely to stop here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as expected, as soon as Woo-jin’s lips tried to face somewhere other than her face, Hae-gang grabbed his cheek with both hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop, why don’t you stop?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She almost told him to continue casually because of the sudden, informal speech and the face leaning on his hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang visibly calmed her up and down chest. The whole space seems to be filled with the sound of her heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this something to make you feel good about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s funny that he tries to talk to a drunk person, and it’s funny that he kisses her palm when he can say no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While waiting for his words without breathing properly, a languid smile appeared around Woo-jin’s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t intend to just feel good today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere of the smiling face was so fascinating that it seemed dangerous, so Hae-gang, who faced it head-on, lost all her will to refuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire and excitement for something a little more stimulating grew bigger and bigger, and the reason behind it grew out of control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only visible, but it was rather comfortable to decide that it was up to tomorrow, even if they were married and regretted it.</span></p>
