            <p>In the blink of an eye, the weekend had returned.</p>
<p>Days ago, when Woo-jin’s car pulled into the parking lot, Hae-gang couldn’t resist the urge to immediately beckon her over with a finger.</p>
<p>She had anticipated that running a business would entail spending money, and she had expected Woo-jin to arrive in a moderately expensive car. However, the sight that met her eyes was beyond anything she had imagined.</p>
<p>She had seized Woo-jin, who had shown up that evening with a jaw-droppingly expensive sports car, and demanded an explanation.</p>
<p>“Driving an expensive car is a surefire way to earn a bad reputation as a reckless driver. Even if you are not, people around you will steer clear of you,” she chided.</p>
<p>Woo-jin had hastily backpedaled, but that wasn’t the issue. The issue was the matte black vehicle, which appeared to have been driven directly out of Gotham City by Batman himself.</p>
<p>Naturally, Woo-jin was proud of the choice of color.</p>
<p>“I wanted something that resembled the titanium hue of your hair, and that caught my eye,” he had explained.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Hae-gang gave up any further attempts to persuade him. Woo-jin was not a man who could be easily swayed.</p>
<p>And now, as Hae-gang sat nervously in the driver’s seat, she found the steering wheel to be more comfortably fitted in her hands than she had expected.</p>
<p>She mentally rehearsed the steps of starting the engine, but thankfully, it seemed that she hadn’t forgotten anything crucial.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Woo-jin had dressed in casual attire and taken his place in the passenger seat, affixing a beginner driving sticker to the back of her slim frame. The sight struck Hae-gang as rather incongruous.</p>
<p>But Woo-jin seemed unperturbed as she carefully affixed the sticker’s end so that it wouldn’t come loose.</p>
<p>“As expected of FM,” she remarked, “there’s no shame in being a beginner driver.”</p>
<p>After fastening his seat belt with meticulous care, he turned to Hae-gang and declared,</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang revved the engine, a familiar routine she had performed countless times. Her hand moved with practiced ease, and soon the car glided forward, the gentle motion setting her on her way.</p>
<p>“I think I did alright,” Hae-gang muttered to herself, seeking validation.</p>
<p>“Well, it wasn’t terrible,” came the lukewarm response.</p>
<p>The fleeting notion that everything would be fine was shattered the moment he hit the road. At first, her driving was clumsy, and mistakes piled up, leaving him flustered and frazzled.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, who had always been composed, had started talking rapidly in recent days. His words were harsh, cutting through the air with an intensity that was hard to ignore.</p>
<p>“Uh, uh, uh? Oh my god!” Woo-jin exclaimed, gripping the steering wheel tightly, making odd noises. Fortunately, there were no other cars nearby as he fumbled through the driving maneuvers.</p>
<p>Hae-gang couldn’t tell if it was because of the expensive sports car she was driving or the “beginner driving” sticker on the rear window, but it was clear that Woo-jin’s guidance was invaluable. Without him, an accident would have likely occurred much sooner.</p>
<p>Feeling rattled, Hae-gang slowed down and turned onto the driveway. Woo-jin’s nervous voice echoed as the car behind them honked impatiently.</p>
<p>“How many times do I have to tell you to use the turn signal when changing lanes? No, that’s the headlight!” Woo-jin exclaimed, his agitation palpable.</p>
<p>“Mr. Lee,” Hae-gang said, his voice tinged with sadness and frustration.</p>
<p>Woo-jin’s piercing gaze met Hae-gang’s, and he spoke quietly but forcefully as if to make sure his words were heard.</p>
<p>Woo-jin swept his hand through his hair in frustration and pointed to a spot on the side of the road.</p>
<p>“Park over there. Turn on the hazard lights,” he said curtly.</p>
<p>As the car came to a stop, an uneasy silence hung in the air. It was Woo-jin who spoke first.</p>
<p>“How on earth did you even get your license?”</p>
<p>“You must have gotten yours because it’s as big as your ego,” Hae-gang shot back, unable to contain her irritation. She couldn’t understand why her driving skills had suddenly become so inadequate, but the frustration in her voice was palpable.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think you’re a terrible teacher?” she added, her words sharper than she intended.</p>
<p>The sting in her eyes worsened as she realized the harshness of her own words.</p>
<p>“That’s rich coming from you. You always find someone else to blame,” Woo-jin retorted, his tone icy. “You’re always quick to point fingers, but the only thing that’s changed is you. It’s only natural to suspect your skills first.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang fumbled for a response, but the silence that followed was deafening. Woo-jin rolled down the window, and the cold wind whipped through the car, leaving them both lost in their own thoughts.</p>
<p>Hae-gang regretted asking Woo-jin for help with driving practice a few days ago. She had overlooked the fact that teaching a loved one to drive was never a good idea.</p>
<p>“Hae-gang,” Woo-jin spoke up, his voice surprisingly calm. “At this rate, it’s impossible for you to learn how to drive anytime soon. I’ll arrange for a professional instructor next week.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang couldn’t shake off the feeling of disappointment at those words, but she couldn’t quite articulate why it bothered her so much.</p>
