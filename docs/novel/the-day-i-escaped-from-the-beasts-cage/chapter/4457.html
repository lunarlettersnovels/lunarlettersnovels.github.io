            <p>“Who are you running from?”</p>
<p>At Woo-jin’s question, Hae-gang stopped chewing. <em>You promised not to ask for anything. </em>When she looked at him with a hint of resentment, he waved his hand.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to talk, you don’t have to,” he said. “Let’s just eat.”</p>
<p>As silence ensued between them, Hae-gang let out a small laugh. It was quite funny how he regretted his decisions immediately. Hae-gang put down the spoon she was holding and touched the corner of her lips. <em>How long has it been since I laughed? </em>She didn’t know the day would come when she would smile so easily. b</p>
<p>Hae-gang decided to change her mind. He had managed to make her laugh, so she would answer his question properly just once. She lowered her hands from her lips and placed them on her lap.</p>
<p>“From the owner.”</p>
<p>Woo-jin stopped midair; he was supposed to set aside the tray. He seemed to feel the weight of the words that came out of her mouth, too.</p>
<p>“The owner?” he repeated.</p>
<p>Hae-gang could tell he was repulsed. She wondered whether her choice of vocabulary was a little too extreme, but there was no other word more fitting than that. “He” governed her every moment, every meal, and every step. She was not even allowed to cross the threshold of the room. She only woke up eating solid meals three times a day. Aside from that, there was nothing else she could do in a limited space. For two years, her world became a mere hotel suite.</p>
<p>Hae-gang cleared her throat with a cough, hoping that her voice wouldn’t tremble.</p>
<p>“Where I came from is a place like everyone’s dream,” she said quietly.</p>
<p>Isn’t it challenging to book a suite room in a hotel that is said to be the most luxurious in Korea? However, this was not the case for Hae-gang. She’d rather have her legs cut off than set foot in that place again.</p>
<p>“But to me,” Hae-gang paused for a moment, noticing that her hands were trembling, “it felt like a cage.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang rubbed her left wrist against her thigh. Her memories brought her back to the time “he” had held her in his tight grip, which felt like a leash. Every time his big hands wrapped themselves around her, she felt like she would never be able to leave. She had tears in her eyes as she thought about horrible things that had happened in the past.</p>
<p>“It was like a place to hold people captive,” she whispered.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Today is Kiwoo, Daesan, TN, and Moon Ik,” Secretary Lee announced. Woo-jin looked at her. He would have done everything he could to keep her mouth shut.</p>
<p>“You don’t seem tired,” he muttered. He was certain he had expressed his intent very clearly, but seeing her persistence, she must have a lot of energy left to argue with him. Woo-jin frowned and gave the same answer as before without a single thought.</p>
<p>“Reject everything.”</p>
<p>“But, sir—”</p>
<p>This time, he stopped Secretary Lee’s words with a look that said he’d have the same response every single day, no matter how much she tried to convince him. Woo-jin leaned back with an annoyed expression on his face. He was sick of the endless proposals. Perhaps he should marry to put an end to this ridiculousness.</p>
<p>“Will any woman suffice?” he asked thoughtlessly.</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>Secretary Lee asked back as if she had not heard him properly, but Woo-jin did not answer. It was an idea not worth reconsidering, let alone sharing with others. But the thought kept coming to his mind, and Woo-jin had to close his eyes. a suitable candidate for a pretend marriage. He could not easily shake off the idea that crossed his mind impulsively.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a woman who has no choice but to live. Around him. It wasn’t certain, of course, that she would accept such a proposal, but she was the only ideal option. There would be no need for a relationship between them, which was great.</p>
<p>A long sigh leaked from Woo-jin’s lips. He knew his thoughts were heading in the wrong direction. He picked up a pen while looking at Secretary Lee, who was standing dazedly. It meant no more talking.</p>
<p>Secretary Lee bowed her head and left in haste. Woo-jin, who was left alone, suddenly remembered the woman’s words in the hospital.</p>
<p><em>It was like a place to hold people captive.</em></p>
<p>He frowned as he recalled her face when she uttered those words. He couldn’t pinpoint what emotions had flashed on her face, whether it was remorse, misery, fear, or pain, but he was certain none of it was positive.</p>
<p>Woo-jin caught himself being concerned.</p>
