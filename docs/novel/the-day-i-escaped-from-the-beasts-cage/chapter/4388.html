            <p>Charlie’s Office.</p>
<p>“CEO, I’ve carried out the tasks you assigned, but I’m really not sure if this is acceptable…”</p>
<p>As the voice of his trembling secretary reached him, Woojin, who had been reading an article, turned his gaze in that direction. Setting aside the article, he raised his hand and lightly scratched his eyebrow before speaking.</p>
<p>“What can we do? The work is already done.”</p>
<p>In response to his somewhat careless reply, the secretary’s shoulders slumped, and an embarrassed expression crossed his face. Seeing his crestfallen look, Woojin added some words. If he had assigned a department head, there would have undoubtedly been objections, so choosing this secretary was also part of his plan to criticize and reprimand.</p>
<p>“Good job, Secretary. Don’t worry, nothing major will happen. Just go on and leave.”</p>
<p>With a genuinely kind voice, the secretary’s face brightened a bit, and he left the room. Woojin then turned his attention back to the article filling the screen. Spreading rumors was easy, especially in a world dominated by the internet, and even more so nowadays. Especially since the advent of social media, there is no longer a need to concoct elaborate novels to sway journalists. As long as there was a hint of sensationalism, they would eagerly spread it.</p>
<p>“It’s regrettable, but there’s no other way.”</p>
<p>In truth, when he found out that the man from Hae-gang’s past was Yoon Geon-ho, Woojin even considered joining forces with Seon Woo. There were few allies as dependable as him, and it was the fastest route to his goal. Yet the reason he aimed for Sun-Woo instead of Geon Ho was simple. He had laid his hands on Hae-gang’s face.</p>
<p>From the day Hae-gang was struck, Woojin had never once forgiven Sun-Woo.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>On the morning when articles related to Sun-Woo started to surface, Hae-gang woke up as early as dawn and tossed and turned in bed. She was cautious, fearing that Woojin might wake up. Thankfully, after gazing at the ceiling for a long while with her heart pounding, she heard only the steady rhythm of his breathing, and there was no sign of him stirring. She finally pulled back the covers and looked at him several times before being able to put her feet on the floor. With careful steps to prevent any sound, she headed out of the room, making sure her slippers didn’t scrape on the floor.</p>
<p>“Ugh, my head.”</p>
<p>Yesterday’s excessive drinking had left Hae-gang with a splitting headache. Despite that, she reluctantly took steps forward. After washing her face briefly before entering the kitchen, she started feeling somewhat more alert. Opening the kitchen cabinet, she took out a jar of honey. It wasn’t difficult to find things now that she was familiar with the layout.</p>
<p>“Just how much did I drink?”</p>
<p>Despite her body feeling like she had emptied every bottle of alcohol in the store, the truth was that Hae-gang had only consumed the one bottle of wine she had ordered initially. Taking a sip of the sweet honey water, she sat down on the living room sofa and hugged a cushion.</p>
<p>Now, let’s try to recall what happened yesterday. Woojin had purposefully offered her a drink, and she had obediently gone along, drinking quite a bit. So, had she said what he wanted her to say?</p>
<p>A fog seemed to cloud her mind, and she couldn’t remember anything clearly. She tried to wrap her head around it, and as she did, a voice came from above.</p>
<p>“You drank quite a bit yesterday. Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Following the voice, she raised her head and saw Woojin coming down. At the same time, the haze in her mind began to gradually clear.</p>
<p>With a series of memories flooding back, Hae-gang’s lips gradually parted.</p>
<p>[ I like you.]</p>
<p>As if to stop those words from escaping her lips, she quickly covered her mouth.</p>
<p>“I must be crazy.”</p>
<p>She must be crazy. She had never intended to say those words, worried they might burden her in the future. But somehow, it happened. It seemed like last night she wasn’t quite herself.</p>
<p>With each memory resurfacing, her embarrassment grew stronger. Unable to utter a single word, she just sat there with her mouth agape. However, Woojin leaned in closer, resting his arm on the backrest of the sofa and lightly brushing his lips against her ear.</p>
<p>“Wha-what!”</p>
<p>Startled, she jerked back, and Woojin’s eyebrows lifted slightly as if he didn’t quite appreciate Hae-gang’s reaction.</p>
<p>“You said you wanted me to.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you pout and ask why I didn’t do it yesterday?”</p>
<p>His words triggered a magical revelation, and it all came rushing back. The peak of her drunken antics from yesterday.</p>
<p>“Why, why aren’t you doing it? I did it!”</p>
<p>“Late at night, Miss Dawn. That’s well.”</p>
<p>“Only doing one side might make the other side jealous, so I did both! Why are you making me jealous?”</p>
<p>From the scene where she kissed his ear while being tipsy to when she had practically thrown herself onto the bed, insisting that he should kiss her back too,</p>
<p>In the end, Woojin couldn’t resist her pouting and kissed both of her ears in turn.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. Are you satisfied now?”</p>
<p>“Do it again tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The memory of herself saying those words vividly brought Woojin’s expression to mind. He had been surprised, but there was a strange cuteness in the way he looked at her. It had made her feel oddly pleased.</p>
<p>But only for a moment…</p>
<p>“Our father used to give me a kiss before leaving when I was young. Yoon Geon, Mr. A., and that crazy guy never skipped it either.”</p>
<p>As soon as Geon-ho’s name was mentioned, the expression disappeared from Woojin’s face.</p>
<p>“Mr. Min Woojin is so lacking. You talk big, but then you’re like this?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“So, you know! What is it that I want to say now? Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, kiss me too. Huh? Please!”</p>
<p>“I got it. I said I got it, so let’s stop now and calm down.”</p>
<p>Finally, Hae-gang recalled every detail without leaving anything out, and she hid her face behind a cushion. It couldn’t have been a more embarrassing situation. She thought she’d rather act boldly like that person, so why did she have to throw a tantrum? If she was going to throw a tantrum, she should have done it moderately. Why did she bring up Yoon Geonho’s name? It wasn’t Woojin; it was her who should have refrained from drinking.</p>
<p>“Sto-stop lying.”</p>
<p>First things first, she needed to halt this. If she brought up the subject again after mentioning Yoon Geonho, it would only work against her. She stumbled over her words a bit, but thankfully, it seemed that Woojin didn’t catch on.</p>
<p>“Then, do you remember this too?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang caught the subtle smirk on his face. She had tried not to ask, but curiosity was always a problem. She reluctantly opened her lips, which refused to stay shut and managed to speak.</p>
<p>“What else is there?”</p>
<p>“My ex-husband asked for it twice because I did it once.”</p>
<p>“I never said that!”</p>
<p>She had never, under any circumstances, said such a thing. Unable to bear the injustice, she stood up abruptly. Woojin, who had also removed his hand from the backrest and opened his eyes slightly, seemed to be aware of what was happening.</p>
<p>“Is it possible that you just don’t remember?”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>Hae-gang chastised herself for her foolish reaction. Falling into such an obvious trap. She glanced at Woojin, then hesitantly let her lips part.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Are you upset?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t particularly enjoyable.”</p>
<p>Seeing Woojin sincerely respond to such an obvious question made her feel even more apologetic. Contrary to his claim that he didn’t feel well, he walked into the kitchen with a face that seemed like he didn’t care much. After a short wait, the familiar scent of coffee wafted in the air, and in the distance, she heard a voice.</p>
<p>“Do you still hold a grudge against that person?”</p>
<p>“Who, Yoon Geon-ho?!”</p>
<p>A deep sense of disgust washed over Hae-gang’s face. Following Woojin with long strides, she grabbed his arm and turned him around.</p>
<p>“What was that just now? How can you say something like that about me?”</p>
<p>“There’s a saying about drunk talk. Maybe you didn’t even realize—”</p>
<p>“Mr. Min Woojin!”</p>
<p>Although she knew it was unreasonable, she cut him off. Just hearing the name Yoon Geonho brought about such negative emotions that it was impossible for her to have any lingering feelings.</p>
<p>“Just forget about what I said yesterday!”</p>
<p>Hae-gang couldn’t finish her sentence, and her lips trembled. The words got stuck in her throat, unable to pass through.</p>
<p>It seemed as if he had caught the subtle amusement playing on her face. Though she initially tried not to inquire, curiosity often proved to be a formidable force. Hae-gang hesitated no longer, parting her lips that were determined not to yield and finding her voice.</p>
<p>“What else is there?”</p>
<p>“It was your ex-husband’s request for a second one after I had already done it once.”</p>
<p>“I never said that!”</p>
<p>She had never uttered such words under any circumstances. The injustice was too much to bear, causing her to abruptly rise from her seat. Woojin, who had removed his hand and slightly opened his eyes, appeared to sense the unfolding situation.</p>
<p>“Could it be that you just don’t remember?”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>Hae-gang chided herself for her naive reaction. Falling into such an obvious trap. Glancing at Woojin, she hesitantly removed her hand from her lips to speak.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Did that bother you?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t exactly pleasant.”</p>
<p>Witnessing Woojin sincerely answer such a straightforward question only deepened her sense of remorse. Despite claiming he wasn’t feeling well, he walked into the kitchen with an almost indifferent expression. After a short while, the familiar aroma of coffee wafted through the air, and in the distance, she heard his voice.</p>
<p>“Is there still lingering resentment towards that person?”</p>
<p>“Who, Yoon Geonho?!”</p>
<p>A profound sense of repulsion surfaced on Hae-gang’s face. Following Woojin with determined strides, she grabbed his arm and turned him around.</p>
<p>“What did you mean just now? How can you say something like that about me?”</p>
<p>“There’s a saying about drunk confessions. Maybe you weren’t aware—”</p>
<p>“Mr. Min Woojin!”</p>
<p>Even though she recognized the irrationality of her response, she cut him off. Just mentioning Yoon Geonho’s name evoked such a negative emotional response that there was no room for any lingering feelings.</p>
<p>“Just forget about what I said yesterday!”</p>
<p>Hae-gang couldn’t complete her sentence as her lips trembled. The words were lodged in her throat, unable to find a way out.</p>
