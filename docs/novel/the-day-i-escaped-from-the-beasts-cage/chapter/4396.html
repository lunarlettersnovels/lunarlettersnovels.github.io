            <p>Upon discovering the burst area, Woo-jin stifled a small sigh. The tender flesh was torn apart, and the surrounding area was swollen, causing discomfort to every nook and cranny of his body as if it were his own injured self. Her head, neck, chest, and somewhere in her abdomen, faint pains echoed from all directions.</p>
<p>He made a mistake. In his earnest desire for this person to roam carefree like others, he failed to notice anything else. “Ah.” Unconsciously clenching his jaw, Woo-jin exerted force with his hand, causing Hae-gang’s eyebrows to slightly furrow.</p>
<p>Realizing the change belatedly, Woo-jin inserted a cotton swab into the parting of her lips. Every time he touched the wound, her eyebrows, corners of her eyes, and the bridge of her nose wrinkled, accompanied by tears that welled up.</p>
<p>Reddened corners of the eyes, moistened irises, and a cracked mouth. Even the burgeoning sense of guilt was pushed aside as a slightly provocative thought took hold of his mind. Thanks to that, he had to exert considerable effort to focus on the wound inside her mouth.</p>
<p>After quickly applying the ointment and removing the cotton swab, it was still tender but clearly stained. A moan escaped Hae-gang’s mouth as her lips, which had caught a glimpse of the reddened area, uttered a sound of suffering.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt a lot?”</p>
<p>“It stings.”</p>
<p>It seemed that the ointment had touched the wound, causing a burning sensation. Hae-gang’s expression, unexpectedly, did not relax. Woo-jin grabbed her hand, which was fidgeting on her cheek.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I caused you to encounter Sun-woo.”</p>
<p>Hae-gang’s finger twitched and curled at the mention of that name. Woo-jin didn’t find that reaction pleasant. Perhaps it was because he thought that what he knew might not be everything.</p>
<p>What happened to you within the high walls of Moon-Ik? What did those people do to you? Why do you tremble just by seeing his face or hearing his name? Many questions arose, but Woo-jin didn’t confuse the order. First and foremost, he wanted to apologize and reflect.</p>
<p>“I should have told you in advance. I regretted it all morning.”</p>
<p>“…. Yes.”</p>
<p>“From now on, let’s make sure to ask and follow Miss Dawn’s opinion.” Upon hearing his words, Hae-gang smiled, but it was merely a gesture to conceal her ambiguity, as she lifted her lips. Strangely, ever since the first time I saw her, I could clearly distinguish this aspect.</p>
<p>When she is truly joyful, she doesn’t wear the same expression as she does now. She gives off a more vibrant feeling, akin to flower clouds or rainbows. What he wanted to see was that kind of laughter. The laughter that bloomed as if it possessed the whole world while standing on the terrace railing long ago</p>
<p>Woo-jin pulled Hae-gang’s petite head closer and kissed her moist lips. Her eyes, wide open in surprise, closed perfectly in sync with the movement of his tongue. The slightly trembling shoulders every time his mouth touched the wound were endearing. He gently pressed down on her elevated shoulders and tapped the roof of her mouth, and she firmly held his hand.</p>
<p>“Ah.” Making a faint sound, her fallen lips touched Hae-gang’s eyelids. The still red corners of her eyes bothered him. The trembling eyelids gradually opened after Woo-jin’s lips retreated. She hesitated for a moment before finally speaking.</p>
<p>“Does this mean an apology?”</p>
<p>With those words, Woo-jin understood. Hae-gang was trying to assign some meaning to their relationship. If there was any significance to physical affection, he couldn’t be unaware of it. Hae-gang was afraid that her emotions were interfering with their relationship.</p>
<p>But Woo-jin didn’t know how to retreat. He encased her small face with both hands, making it impossible for her to escape, and stared at her trembling pupils for a long time. It had to be clear that he wasn’t just speaking empty words.</p>
<p>“No, it’s just a general meaning.”</p>
<p>The bed that supported the weight of both bodies shook noticeably. Hae-gang gladly welcomed Woo-jin, who sought her lips, as her thick, grayish hair scattered over the soft duvet. They had already discarded any hindrances from their clothing. The skin, once so soft, succumbed to the warmth that filled the bedroom and quickly turned sticky.</p>
<p>As Woo-jin’s lips descended, finding their place between her dry thighs, he thrust his hips forward.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Her head turned pale from the excruciating pain that felt like being torn in half. Brushing away the hair that bothered her eyes, he bent his body and overlapped their bodies more closely. Even those small movements overwhelmed Hae-gang, causing her to clasp his hand.</p>
<p>“Wait, ah, just a moment…”</p>
<p>Her hand was caught by his casually gesticulating hand. Pressing their intertwined fingers against the bed, further resistance became meaningless. Following the captured hand, she raised her moist gaze, meeting Woo-jin’s eyes.</p>
