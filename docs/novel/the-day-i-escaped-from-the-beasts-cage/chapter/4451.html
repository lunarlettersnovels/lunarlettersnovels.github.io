            <p>After accompanying Hae-gang to the hospital room, Woo-jin returns home and kills time by staring into the void. In his mind, the information he heard today at sea was mixed with the information he heard yesterday.</p>
<p>A person whose death has already been reported and whose husband is so powerful that Charlie’s representative cannot do anything about it. As if an accident had occurred, massive scars were left all over the body and that visage.</p>
<p>All the evidence they had pointed to one individual.</p>
<p>“Nonsense.”</p>
<p>He repeated the phrases that he had repeated 15 times just today.</p>
<p><em>I believed that you resembled her. I believed that you resembled her.</em></p>
<p>Woo-jin raised his hand to his face and wiped it dry. The forgotten past comes to mind with increasing clarity. It was never a memory with a happy ending.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Eight years ago, a meeting was held between cultural content-producing companies. The invited guests included the company president and his family, as well as Woo-Jin’s father and chairman, Min Kyu-hyun.</p>
<p>But is the company’s small size a problem in comparison to other businesses? Woo-jin considered the name in its proper context.</p>
<p>“Kim Woojin, Lee Ra…”</p>
<p>“You care about such matters. Humans are fallible, and mistakes are possible.”</p>
<p>Kyu-hyun, who was seated at the same table as Woo-jin, gave him a friendly pat on the back. His father, who was initially optimistic, didn’t seem to give it much thought, but Woo-jin couldn’t take it.</p>
<p><em>Could this be a simple error made by the organizers?</em></p>
<p>His eyes landed on the name of his father. If it were just him, it would be possible, but it is safe to assume that even the misspelling of the company’s CEO’s name was deliberate.</p>
<p>When he saw the host of the party, the representative of Gahi Entertainment who had greeted him earlier, Woo-jin burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Recently, a renowned actor from the other side moved to Seora. Woo-jin played a significant role. As soon as Woo-jin walked into the meeting, the well-known actress nodded her head in agreement, even though she hadn’t yet heard the details of her contract.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for rumors about him to focus on his appearance rather than his ability to reach people’s ears.</p>
<p>Well, it is said that someone lobbed his body, but it is more aristocratic to claim that he caught it with his face.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, he never anticipated suffering this type of petty retribution.</p>
<p>Again, looking at the incorrect name, Woo-jin could not conceal his pitiful heart. After waiting for the host to complete his greeting, he stood up in response to the sound of applause.</p>
<p>“I’ll be absent for some time.”</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>He ran into a woman carrying a bottle of wine who was walking by from behind. This may have happened quickly. The wine was spilled by the wind, leaving behind a sweet aroma and a sticky sensation on the hand.</p>
<p>“Oh no! I am sorry.”</p>
<p>That’s acceptable.</p>
<p>He walked outside and turned his head to find the bathroom, leaving the woman who had just apologized to him looking very sorry. He only washed his hands, not even his clothing.</p>
<p>However, the stickiness lasted longer than anticipated. Because he heard derogatory remarks on the terrace, which he had to pass by to access the restroom.</p>
<p>“Did you see the face of that child?” “Women will go crazy.”</p>
<p>“Would rumors have existed? Han Seo-hee signed the contract after falling in love with his face.”</p>
<p>“Then, is this rumor accurate?” “Why is that…?”</p>
<p>“When there is no smoke coming out of the chimney, there is no smoke coming out of the chimney.” To be honest, Seora lacks the allure of Gahi. “They differ in size.”</p>
<p>The sound of laughter is accompanied by the odor of cigarettes. Woo-jin chose not to wait any longer due to their ceaseless chatter. It is better to return before it’s too late, as he has escaped.</p>
<p>Initially, he lacked the sensibility to listen to the chatter of incompetent individuals. His theory was that memorizing such information was a waste of cognitive resources.</p>
<p>The insensitivity and blatant sarcasm of Woo-jin, however, could not be overlooked.</p>
<p>“Hey, who are you?” “Aren’t you Min Woo-Jin?”</p>
<p>As he walked by the terrace, he stopped when he heard a man grunt, which meant he had seen him.</p>
<p>The man walked up to him and motioned for him to brush off his shoulder. His pretending-to-be-gentle hand quickly transformed into a weapon and gripped the collar.</p>
<p>This is the hand he smoked with.</p>
<p>Then, Woo-jin, who had the courage to confront a man, attempted to speak:</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” “Can you not release that hand?”</p>
<p>The woman who courageously broke through this bloody atmosphere was Woo-Jin’s first love, Hae-gang.</p>
