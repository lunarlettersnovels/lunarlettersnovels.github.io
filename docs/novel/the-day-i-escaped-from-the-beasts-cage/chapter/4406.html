        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin had departed, leaving Hae-gang with a newfound desire to venture out. The former’s words of encouragement had seeded a longing that had hit her since he had been absent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang’s mind mulled over Woo-jin’s advice, and she realized that she couldn’t continue secluding herself at home indefinitely. She couldn’t bear the thought of being trapped within Rudy’s four walls forever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hae-gang perched on the dressing table, a hair dryer in hand, he noticed his liver felt bigger than usual. She questioned himself, “Is this also a sign of insecurity?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a slight tilt of her head, she switched on the hair dryer, causing her locks to dance in the warm breeze. One silver lining of cutting her hair was the time it saved while washing and drying it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satisfied with her quick morning routine, Hae-gang descended the stairs. She encountered the housekeeper in the kitchen, who greeted her cordially. She inquired about her plans for the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang replied, “I plan to explore the neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How would you like your breakfast?” she asked. “All I have to do is boil some soup.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, Hae-gang contemplated turning down the offer, but she remembered Woo-jin’s words of advice and decided to partake in a hearty meal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to eat,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t want to be caught off guard, and without the energy to run away should she chance upon any danger, the housekeeper looked surprised, knowing Hae-gang’s tendency to skip breakfast. Nonetheless, she set the table for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she ate, Hae-gang admired the bustling activity with the housemaid in the house. She watched with wonder as she chopped vegetables with ease. From the kitchen, she overheard the maid’s voice, “I feel happy when my husband eats. It’s like I’m fattening up my skinny son.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pride etched on her face stirred an unexpected emotion within her. It had been ages since she had been consumed by such a concern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He” too appeared preoccupied, but it was all just an outburst of temper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I feel like I’m losing weight,’ she said, expressing her apprehension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Is it because the food doesn’t suit your taste?”  “he” quipped, his tone accusatory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I hope you’re not asking because you really think so,’ she retorted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I should let go of Chef Aman this time too. You can’t even put on weight,’ he grumbled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘When did you become so bad at communicating?  She lamented, and the conversation devolved into a monologue of complaints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day was a repeat of the previous one, and the stress was building up. “He” disregarded the numerous factors that could be contributing to her weight loss and chose to hold Chef Aman responsible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t help but ponder how many people would have to lose their livelihoods in the future to meet “his” demands. The man she thought she knew so well hid his true self during their five-year-long marriage. It was either excellent or appalling; there was no in-between.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The housekeeper detected the discontent that had crept up on her and hastened to apologize. “Oh, I’m sorry. That was a bit harsh, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang waved her hand. It was her fault for allowing her thoughts to stray in the middle of the conversation. “No, I just chuckled a bit. But I have put on weight since I came here. Thanks to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid’s food was delectable, and every bite demanded a laborious effort to chew. As she lifted her frail wrist to eat, the maid’s face lit up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s a good idea to go out. I was a little concerned because you’re always at home,” the maid’s voiced her opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know. I should’ve ventured out earlier,” she acknowledged, and suddenly it dawned on her. Was this why Woo-jin kept pushing her to leave the house? Was he worried sick about her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang is funny, and it’s not too much to hope for some small comforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps it’s because all the people she met during the two years she was trapped with Rudy were his people. She feels like there’s no one in the world on her side, and the weight of that isolation is so crushing that it feels like a personal vendetta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She leans on others and tries to socialize, even though it doesn’t come naturally to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she knows she needs to break the habit of relying too much on Woo-jin, or she’ll be hopelessly lonely once he’s gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then eat, ma’am. I’ll be back after I clean up my room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang expresses her gratitude briefly but then delays starting her meal even after picking up her chopsticks. Looking at the side dishes arranged so prettily on the plate, she feels a pang of guilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wants to cook something new and delicious for Woo-jin—something that’s not just taken out of the fridge. With a sigh, she puts down her chopsticks and leaves the kitchen to search for Yeoju’s house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ma’am?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, why aren’t you eating? Don’t you like the side dishes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, no! It’s not that, it’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it takes her a while to chew and swallow the embarrassment, no one pressures her to speak. Hae-gang finally breaks her long silence with a heartfelt embrace for Yeoju’s family, who wait for her with smiling faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please teach me how to cook later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Food?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, Yeoju.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to feed my husband a freshly cooked meal, too. I tried it last time, but I failed. I’m not good at cooking.”</span></p>
