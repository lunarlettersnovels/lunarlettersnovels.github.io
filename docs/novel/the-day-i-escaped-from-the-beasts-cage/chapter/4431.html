            <p>Woo-jin realized that his wife might be opposed to the idea as well. “We haven’t talked about it separately, but she might be feeling the same way,” he confessed.</p>
<p>She would not leave his house for the three-year contract period if he could.</p>
<p>Woo-jin raised an eyebrow at Han as she spoke about the wedding.</p>
<p>“Why should my lack of a wedding be an issue?” he wondered.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think your wife might feel embarrassed when she meets her friends and they’re all talking about their lavish weddings and proposals? Your wife would just have to sit there and listen,” Han responded, her voice tinged with concern.</p>
<p>Woo-jin thought about her words and nodded. “I see what you’re saying,” he admitted.</p>
<p>Woo-jin, on the other hand, had no one to talk to about weddings or honeymoons. And he couldn’t afford a honeymoon at the moment.</p>
<p>The idea of a short trip away from Korea for a honeymoon, on the other hand, had its appeal. It would provide a temporary distraction while also satisfying his previous desires for “other interests.”</p>
<p>Han quickly returned the conversation to the task at hand, realizing that her words were making sense to Woo-jin.</p>
<p>“I strongly advise you to go on a honeymoon, CEO, and if necessary, I’ll rearrange my schedule and take a week off.”</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>Hae-gang was in the bathroom, trying to calm down her swollen face with cold water when she heard the front door open. She cautiously peered out, surprised at the unexpected visitor.</p>
<p>It was a middle-aged woman with a warm demeanor, who was neatly organizing her shoes. Haegang remembered hearing that the woman worked for Woo-jin.</p>
<p>The woman looked around the house as if searching for someone, before noticing Hae-gang and giving her a warm welcome.</p>
<p>“Hello. So, you’re the lady from Yeoju, right?” Hae-gang asked.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, ma’am. Oh, my God, such a pretty person has come.” Yeoju’s house replied with a kind smile.</p>
<p>Hae-gang helped Yeoju carry her shopping bags and noticed that one of the bags was full of clothes.</p>
<p>“The CEO sent me clothes for you to wear,” Yeoju explained.</p>
<p>Haegang frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“I’ve been told the precautions. He told me to keep silent about his wife.” Yeoju continued.</p>
<p>“Where should I organize this?”</p>
<p>Haegang initially pointed towards her room but quickly withdrew her arm, thinking it would raise suspicion if Yeoju found traces of her life there. She asked Yeoju to tidy up the kitchen instead.</p>
<p>“Ah! I’ll sort this out. I have my own way of organizing things. Could you tidy up the kitchen for me?”</p>
<p>“Shall we?” The woman replied, heading into the kitchen.</p>
<p>But a scream soon echoed from the kitchen, “Oh, my! What’s this?”</p>
<p>Hae-gang cringed, knowing what the woman had stumbled upon. She had cleaned up as best she could, but the mess was still there.</p>
<p>Hae-gang quickly threw the shopping bags into her room and closed the door tightly, breathing a sigh of relief. She knew that she needed to discuss the situation with Woo-jin as soon as he returned.</p>
