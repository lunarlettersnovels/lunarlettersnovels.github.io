            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing the housework, which included cleaning the kitchen and making a small portion of side dishes that were put in the refrigerator, the woman said goodbye to Hae-gang who was waiting at the front door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang watched as the woman left and then returned to the neatly organized house. She opened her shopping bags and was surprised by the number of clothing items she had received. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin had apparently bought many items, including a coat and dress, based on the brands she had mentioned in the past. The guest room’s closet was not large enough to store all these items, so Hae-gang began to carefully unfold and organize the clothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he was busy with her task, he suddenly heard Woo-jin calling out for him. “Ms. Han Dawn!” he shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m here!” Hae-gang replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang left the scattered clothes and went out to greet Woo-jin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin had just taken off his gloves and neatly placed them on the table when he saw Hae-gang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What did you do today?” Woo-jin asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling a chill, Hae-gang headed towards the kitchen, thinking about serving some hot tea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I said hello to the woman and chatted with her,” Hae-gang replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s normal,” Woo-jin said. “By the way, how strong is she?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang turned to him, not having heard the interjection. When Hae-gang asked again, Woo-jin followed her into the kitchen and pulled out a chair at the table, giving a faint smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I said she was strong,” Hae-gang replied. “She brought all the clothes I sent her all at once.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang took out the flower tea she had prepared earlier from the cupboard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What kind of clothes did you buy so many of?” Hae-gang asked. “I only need a few?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling regret after asking such a question, Hae-gang tensed up, anticipating a negative response from Woo-jin. However, Woo-jin was uncomfortable hearing such words and did not respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang frowned at Woo-jin’s response, feeling a knot form in her stomach. Facing the servant’s questions about their separate rooms was a difficult situation for her, who had always been good at keeping up appearances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to come up with a story that explains why we have separate rooms,” she suggested, trying to sound confident. “It doesn’t have to be the truth. Just something that sounds convincing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin nodded in agreement, relaxing back in his chair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, I’ll help you think of something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang thought about the situation all afternoon, but Woo-jin seemed to have made a quick decision. Hae-gang noticed that Woo-jin’s face was calm, and felt that she shouldn’t ask about his decision. However, Hae-gang disregarded this feeling and asked, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, how?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin replied simply, “It’s simple. We can sleep together.” Hae-gang nodded her head semi-automatically at Woo-jin’s words, and then straightened up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hae-gang asked, “Are you talking about us?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woo-jin responded, “Who else is in this house besides me and you?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere around the table became calm. Perhaps interpreting the situation positively, Woo-jin noticed the tea had infused with color and scent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The clothing delivered today can be stored in my dressing room. It’s larger than most bedrooms and has plenty of empty space.”</span></p>
