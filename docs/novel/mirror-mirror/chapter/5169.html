            <p><strong>Chapter 12.2</strong></p>
<p>Although he was the most annoying person in the universe, Seok-kyung’s looks were undeniably attractive.</p>
<p>“See? He’s amazing, right? Honestly, even other goblins would fall for him.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon laughed heartily again.</p>
<p>“Hong-seon and I aren’t exactly unattractive, but compared to our Geumsang Jeonha, we’re nothing. Like a drop in the ocean, a grain of sand on the beach, or a single hair on a cow.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon praised Seok-kyung’s looks to the skies, even using idioms. Then he suddenly lowered his voice and cupped his hand around his mouth.</p>
<p>“But do you know why?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Do you know why our Geumsang Jeonha has such an exceptionally radiant appearance? Aren’t you curious?”</p>
<p>Ara found herself drawn into Cheong-seon’s words without realizing it. His eloquent and resonant voice had a way of captivating listeners.</p>
<p>“I’m curious. Why is that?”</p>
<p>Ara lowered her voice and asked.</p>
<p>“Ara, don’t play along with Lee Cheong-seon.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung interjected, warning her.</p>
<p>But Ara, mirroring Cheong-seon’s boldness, ignored Seok-kyung’s words. Even when a long, deep sigh was heard, she pretended not to notice.</p>
<p>“Indeed. You’re the only human our Princess Baekseol acknowledges.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon, clearly pleased with Ara, gave her a thumbs-up. Then he cleared his throat and adjusted his voice.</p>
<p>“Ara, do you know the term ‘Yeonwon’ (淵源)?”</p>
<p>“Um… like in ‘tracing the origin,’ that Yeonwon?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Yeonwon means the origin of something. All goblins are born from objects that have absorbed their owner’s *soul and blood, so we call the owner our Yeonwon. We inherit our surname from our Yeonwon because they are the source that brought us into the world.”</p>
<p>*The rule is if people keep calling you back and keep your soul on earth, and your soul/spirit inhabits an object that has a touch of human blood on it, then the spirit will become a goblin.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Ara nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>She recalled reading something similar in a book when she was young. It mentioned that objects touched by human hands or stained with blood for a long time could become goblins.</p>
<p>“My Yeonwon is Yi Hang-bok of the Oseong family. My original form is the blue fan he used. That’s why my name is Cheong-seon (靑扇).”</p>
<p>“Wow. I never would have guessed. An artifact from a historical figure.”</p>
<p>Ara’s eyes sparkled with genuine admiration.</p>
<p>Since Cheong-seon’s original form was a blue fan, it made sense that his hair was bright blue in his human form.</p>
<p>Cheong-seon, encouraged by Ara’s reaction, pointed at Hong-seon with his chopsticks.</p>
<p>“Can you guess who Hong-seon’s Yeonwon is?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“Here’s a hint: Hong-seon and I awakened on the same day. We’re not blood brothers, but we share a strong bond.”</p>
<p>“Could it be… Yi Deok-hyeong?”</p>
<p>“Wow, correct. You must have paid attention in history class.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon clapped his hands. Ara felt a strange sense of pride and slightly raised her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Hong-seon is the red fan used by Yi Deok-hyeong. That’s why his name is Hong-seon (紅扇).”</p>
<p>Ara glanced at Hong-seon.</p>
<p>Hong-seon, who had been quietly eating, nodded once when he felt Ara’s gaze on him. It seemed to confirm that Cheong-seon’s words were true.</p>
<p>“What about Seol-do?”</p>
<p>Ara turned her attention to Seol-do, who was sitting next to Hong-seon.</p>
<p>“I’m the silver knife of independence activist Nam Yeoh-ho. That’s why I’m called Seol-do (雪刀).”</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>Ara’s clear eyes shone with admiration.</p>
<p>Seol-do, with a subtly proud expression, took a big bite of his food.</p>
<p>“Specifically, it’s the knife Nam Yeoh-ho used to cut his finger to write a blood oath. Maybe that’s why I don’t get along with Japanese goblins at all.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon chuckled as he explained.</p>
<p>Seol-do, who was stuffing his cheeks with side dishes, hurriedly swallowed his food to speak.</p>
<p>“Look who’s talking. You’ve hated the Japanese ever since the Imjin War.”</p>
<p>“Did I ever deny it?”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon shrugged, raising his hands. He then absentmindedly petted Baekseol’s neck, who was busy gnawing on a rib. Baekseol kicked Cheong-seon with her hind leg, signaling him not to disturb her while she was eating.</p>
<p>Ara chuckled but then suddenly turned her gaze forward.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung was focused on his meal, seemingly oblivious to the conversation happening around the table. Seeing his composed face made her even more curious about his origin.</p>
<p>“What about you, Kim Seok-kyung? Seok-kyung (石鏡) means… a mirror?”</p>
