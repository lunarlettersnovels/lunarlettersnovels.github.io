            <p><strong>Chapter 9.2</strong></p>
<p>Seok-kyung, despite the weight of his words, placed a clean dish on the drying rack with a nonchalant expression.</p>
<p>“When you live too long, you easily forget what it feels like to be alive. I’m not even human to begin with. The joy of breathing, the fear of recognizing a finite life—those are things I don’t understand well. Appreciating the mundane? That’s even more out of reach for me.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>“That’s why doing something as mundane as this can be quite helpful. It’s just a ritual, but it proves that my time is passing normally.”</p>
<p>His voice was remarkably calm as if he were discussing something utterly mundane and obvious.</p>
<p>But to Ara, his calmness felt oddly sad.</p>
<p>Some might call her concern for a powerful deity naive. After all, she was in a lopsided contract with him, and Seok-kyung was the stingy landlord who would only grant her wish after three months of imposing his will.</p>
<p>Even so, she couldn’t help it. Emotions didn’t stem from logic; they arose unexpectedly, like the pang she felt in her chest now.</p>
<p>Ara wanted to offer him some words of comfort.</p>
<p>The problem was that she knew very little about Seok-kyung. Not just about him, but also about the basic rules and culture of the goblin world. So, she couldn’t even guess what kind of words might bring him comfort.</p>
<p>“So, do you also clean, do laundry, and cook yourself?”</p>
<p>In the end, she changed the subject.</p>
<p>“As much as I can.”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, there wasn’t a speck of dust in the house. His suits were always impeccably pressed, and the easily soiled cuffs and collars were pristinely white.</p>
<p>“That’s surprising. You look like someone who never had to lift a finger.”</p>
<p>“What kind of look is that?”</p>
<p>“This kind of look.”</p>
<p>Ara pointed at Seok-kyung’s face with her index finger.</p>
<p>He turned his head to look down at her, his well-shaped eyebrows forming a slanted line.</p>
<p>Even his skeptical expression was perfect.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you don’t know you’re handsome?” Ara, momentarily lost in thought, accidentally voiced what she had been thinking.</p>
<p>“I know.” His response was even more outrageous.</p>
<p>It would have been ridiculous if he had denied it, but hearing his confident answer was also quite unexpected.</p>
<p>“I’m an exceptional beauty. It’s because of my special nature.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see…”</p>
<p>While Ara looked at him with an expression like she’d bitten into a sour apple, Seok-kyung finished the dishes and thoroughly wiped down the surrounding area with a dry cloth.</p>
<p>“Come with me.”</p>
<p>After cleaning up the dining table, Seok-kyung picked up the jacket he had set aside. The metal watch clicked back onto his solid wrist.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Ara, still unsure of what was happening, took off her apron and followed him.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung, already several steps ahead, glanced back at her. “You need to know the layout of the house so you don’t bother me as much.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seok-kyung personally showed Ara around the goblin house.</p>
<p>There were seven bedrooms alone. In addition, there were about ten other rooms for various purposes: fitness, home theater, meetings, a library, storage, and more. The basement housed a swimming pool and a sauna, and the rooftop had a vegetable garden where he grew his own produce.</p>
<p>Can this even be called a “house”?</p>
<p>Ara discovered for the first time how exhausting it could be just to walk around a house. After checking out the exterior of the house with Seok-kyung, her jaw dropped.</p>
<p>The dilapidated old house she had seen yesterday was nowhere to be found. Instead, a five-story single-family home, seemingly designed by a famous architect, stood in its place. The dirt ground, once home to broken jars and a clogged well, was now covered with well-manicured grass swaying gently in the breeze.</p>
<p>“This is incredible…”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung chuckled at Ara’s unfiltered amazement.</p>
<p>“The exterior and interior structure change irregularly as needed, so don’t be so rustic and easily surprised.”</p>
<p>“Do you change it with a goblin bat? Like, just a tap?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, just like that. At my whim, with a tap.”</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>I should have been born a goblin.</p>
<p>Ara looked around the area several times with an innocent expression. The weather was perfectly sunny, as if to complete the scene, enhancing the beautiful view.</p>
<p>Amidst all this, something suddenly caught her eye—a small path.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
