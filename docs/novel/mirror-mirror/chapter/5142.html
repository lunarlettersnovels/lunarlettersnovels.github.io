            <p><strong>Chapter 26.1</strong></p>
<p>Rrrr. Rrrr. Rrrr.</p>
<p>At seven in the morning, Ara’s phone buzzed and flashed noisily.</p>
<p>After tossing and turning until dawn, she barely woke up to the blaring alarm. Her eyelids felt heavy, as if she had been crushed by something in her dreams, leaving her hot and suffocated.</p>
<p>“Did I sleep poorly…?”</p>
<p>With barely open eyes, Ara reached out her arm. As she tilted her body to find her phone, she felt something warm and heavy sliding against her chest.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Finally sensing something was off, Ara opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p>Looking down beneath her chin, she saw Baekseol, who seemed to have just woken up, shaking off sleep.</p>
<p>“Baekseol? Why are you sleeping here?”</p>
<p>“Why? Can’t I sleep here?”</p>
<p>Baekseol plopped down with a big yawn, stretching luxuriously.</p>
<p>“It’s not that, but…”</p>
<p>“It’s noisy, so turn off the alarm first.”</p>
<p>“Ah, right.”</p>
<p>Ara grabbed her phone and turned off the alarm. As soon as the room fell silent, Baekseol, with her usual nonchalance, gave Ara a playful nudge with her paw.</p>
<p>“Now hurry and feed me. I’m hungry.”</p>
<p>Baekseol’s bold and brazen attitude left Ara momentarily dumbfounded. But her astonished expression quickly softened into a faint smile.</p>
<p>Whether he knew it or not, Baekseol’s fluffy, warm rear was snug against her leg. Her long, white tail swayed playfully like a willow branch.</p>
<p>They say feelings are contagious.</p>
<p>Ara felt her mood lift. As she kicked off the blanket and sat up, Baekseol leapt down from the bed.</p>
<p>“Oh, today it’s just you and me, so you don’t have to make much food.”</p>
<p>“Why? Where did everyone go?”</p>
<p>“The others left early for work. They have a lot to do, more than it looks like. Seok-kyung is super busy today too. He said he’s going to an important meeting and took Nam Seol-do with him.”</p>
<p>Baekseol chattered on cheerfully. Ara nodded along as she headed to the living room.</p>
<p>The house, now empty, felt eerily quiet. The soft hum of the air conditioner and air purifier was distinctly audible. The still morning air made the already spacious house feel even colder.</p>
<p>“Seok-kyung is so kind, you know. He always has to escort Nam-seol, even though I’m way better at fighting. I guess he’s really worried I’ll get hurt.”</p>
<p>As Ara walked toward the dining room, she glanced at Baekseol, who was trotting beside her.</p>
<p>Maybe it was the oddly desolate atmosphere of the house, but at this moment, Baekseol’s lively voice and warm presence felt especially precious.</p>
<p>“But just think how good we’d look together! A king and a princess, a perfect pair!”</p>
<p>Ara chuckled as she walked, but suddenly stopped in the middle of the dining room.</p>
<p>On the elegant marble table lay a single piece of paper, blank and white, with elegant handwriting neatly inscribed.</p>
<p>**”I’ll be out until dinner for an important meeting. Don’t forget to feed Baekseol and take care of her.</p>
<p>P.S. Baekseol hates eating alone, so make sure to eat with her.”**</p>
<p>“Na Ara, don’t you think so?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Uh, yes. Definitely.”</p>
<p>Ara mumbled as she read the brief message again. She had no idea who had written it, but the straightforward tone and style made her suspect it was Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>What’s up with that? Good-looking and good at writing too? What a font that is!</p>
<p>“Humph. For a human, he’s got some discerning eyes. Well, it’s only right that I get pampered a little, considering my greatness.”</p>
<p>Baekseol, caught up in her own thoughts, prattled on until she finally noticed Ara, who was lost in concentration.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>With a sniff, her moist nose twitched eagerly.</p>
<p>“I smell Seok-kyung! …Wait, is that a love letter?”</p>
<p>Baekseol lunged at the paper in Ara’s hand, causing Ara to stumble and fall to the ground.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? It’s not that…”</p>
<p>“Liar!”</p>
<p>Baekseol jumped up onto Ara, her warm weight pushing Ara halfway down.</p>
<p>“What’s that? Show me, what is it?”</p>
<p>Just then, Baekseol’s fluffy paws started playfully slapping Ara’s cheeks.</p>
<p>“It’s just a note telling me to take good care of you!”</p>
<p>Finally surrendering to Baekseol’s jelly punches, Ara thrust the paper in front of her face, stopping the playful slapping.</p>
<p>“See? Right? That’s all it says?”</p>
<p>“Honestly, Seok-kyung still thinks I’m a kid.”</p>
<p>After confirming the note’s contents, Baekseol scoffed and gracefully stepped off Ara, as if she had never engaged in such barbaric antics.</p>
<p>“I can eat by myself now. He knows that, yet he still insists on doing this.” Her cheerful grumbling suddenly faded.</p>
<p>With her upper body barely propped up, Ara brushed the white fur stuck to her cheek and looked at Baekseol with confusion.</p>
<p>“Or rather… right, I still can’t eat alone. I guess that’s true.”</p>
