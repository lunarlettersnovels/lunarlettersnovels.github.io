            <p><strong>Chapter 10.2</strong></p>
<p>Ara frowned at her still-unresponsive phone, then suddenly looked up at Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>“Kim Seok-kyung, what about your smartphone?”</p>
<p>“My phone? Of course it works.”</p>
<p>Ara should have known. Feeling a pang of injustice, she stomped her foot.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s so unfair. I have to live three months behind the times.”</p>
<p>“Well, even when you had good internet, you didn’t seem particularly ahead of the times.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>Seok-gyeong shrugged nonchalantly, as if he didn’t see any problem with stating the obvious.</p>
<p>Not giving up, Ara quickly changing her strategy. She clasped her hands together with a hopeful look.</p>
<p>“Then how about making my phone work like yours? With your magic wand, just like that.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s curt refusal crushed her hopes.</p>
<p>“Ara, get a grip. Did you come here to sightsee?”</p>
<p>The cold tone abruptly brought her back to reality. Ara bit her lip without realizing it.</p>
<p>He was right. She wasn’t here for a leisurely vacation.</p>
<p>If she didn’t make a good impression on this infuriating goblin, the ten billion won debt would remain a curse on her life. She needed to navigate his unwelcome trials with humility and tact.</p>
<p>Yet, she couldn’t help but feel a twinge of disappointment.</p>
<p>This man wasn’t someone who would offer her unconditional affection like her grandmother did. Why did she keep forgetting that? It wasn’t like she was a naive child.</p>
<p>“No, I was just kidding,” Ara said, her mood instantly deflating. Her clasped hands fell limply to her sides, and her shoulders drooped.</p>
<p>“…If you’re really that curious, just watch TV. It’ll show the same broadcasts from the human world.”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>It was like she had a tail and ears. Her emotions were so transparent that they were almost comical.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung sighed deeply and clicked his tongue. Though he hadn’t done anything wrong, he felt like he had disappointed an innocent child, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.</p>
<p>Just then, a buzz from Seok-kyung’s jacket pocket interrupted the moment.</p>
<p>He pulled out his smartphone, checked the new message, and swiftly read through the brightened screen.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. We need to head back soon.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung turned off the phone and slipped it back into his pocket.</p>
<p>“Can’t we stay a bit longer? It’s so beautiful here. There’s so much to see.”</p>
<p>Ara glanced around with a wistful look, reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung glanced at his watch with deliberate nonchalance.</p>
<p>“It’s almost lunchtime. Aren’t you going to prepare?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>What a bothersome goblin. He must have been a miserly landowner in a past life. Probably got swindled by some clever trickster, and now he can’t trust anyone, so he’s always causing trouble…</p>
<p>Ara flailed her arms in frustration but forged ahead. She could hear Seok-kyung’s exasperated chuckle behind her but chose to ignore it.</p>
<p>The way back seemed much shorter than the way there.</p>
<p>I’ll make sure to visit more often when Kim Seok-kyung isn’t around.</p>
<p>Ara quickened her pace, mentally reviewing the ingredients neatly arranged in the fridge.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Her strides came to a sudden halt.</p>
<p>Ara narrowed her eyes and stared intently at the grassy lawn.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>Under the large zelkova tree, something brightly colored and elongated lay sprawled out. Squinting for a closer look, she realized it was two people.</p>
<p>Two men she had never seen before were lying under the tree, one sprawled out with blue hair and the other with red.</p>
<p>Half curiosity, half apprehension.</p>
<p>Ara glanced back to confirm that Seok-kyung was following at a distance and then cautiously resumed her approach. As she drew closer, the strangers’ appearances became clearer.</p>
<p>The blue-haired man wore a casual hoodie, shorts, and sneakers. He had a look that could belong to an airport-going idol or a popular influencer on social media.</p>
<p>In contrast, the red-haired man was dressed in a formal black suit. Unlike Seok-kyung’s flamboyant and colorful attire, his suit was plain and suitable for a wedding or a funeral, giving off a vibe of a stockbroker or a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>Blood?</p>
<p>Ara’s heart skipped a beat as she stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p>If her eyes weren’t deceiving her, there was blood on the men’s faces—bright red, freshly spilled blood.</p>
<p>“Kim Seok-kyung!”</p>
<p>Without thinking, Ara called out urgently.</p>
<p>“Come over here quickly!”</p>
<p>Without waiting for a response, she sprinted toward the two men.</p>
<p>After a breathless dash, Ara reached the fallen men, panting heavily. When she glanced back, Seok-kyung was still approaching at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? There’s blood! They’re bleeding!”</p>
<p>Exasperated, Ara shouted, pointing at the two men. She quickly knelt between the fallen men, her knees hitting the ground hard.</p>
