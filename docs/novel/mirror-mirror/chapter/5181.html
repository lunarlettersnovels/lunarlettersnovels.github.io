            <p><strong>Chapter 6.2</strong></p>
<p>Ara had a peculiar dream.</p>
<p>In the dream, she was dressed in an ancient costume. It was much older than traditional garments from the Goryeo or Joseon periods—perhaps from the Three Kingdoms era or even earlier.</p>
<p>Recognizing her attire, she began to perceive her surroundings.</p>
<p>She was lying on the ground in a puddle of dried, blood-stained earth. On closer inspection, the lavender silk garment that covered her body was smeared with bright red bloodstains.</p>
<p>– What’s going on? Am I dead? Is this my corpse?</p>
<p>Ara struggled to lift her body.</p>
<p>But it felt as though a boulder weighing hundreds of kilograms had been placed on top of her. She couldn’t move even a finger. Realizing this, she found that she was beginning to suffocate.</p>
<p>As she tried to move, the surroundings kept changing. The legs of armored figures passed nearby, and indistinct screams hammered at her ears. The clanging of metal weapons followed closely behind.</p>
<p>– A battlefield? It’s so noisy.</p>
<p>Ara muttered to herself. She had an urgent need to escape this place.</p>
<p>However, at that moment, someone began to stab her body with sharp spears and swords. The attacks were relentless.</p>
<p>– No. Don’t do this. It hurts. Help me!</p>
<p>Ara thrashed about frantically. No, to be precise, she wanted to thrash about.</p>
<p>Just as she was writhing in the excruciating pain that seemed to pierce through her entire body, a horse, which had been wildly thrashing nearby, jumped onto Ara.</p>
<p>“Gah!”</p>
<p>A flash of light.</p>
<p>Ara jerked awake as if a lightning bolt had struck her chest. Gasping for breath, air poured out of her lungs like water from a dam.</p>
<p>“Are you awake?”</p>
<p>At that moment, a strange girl’s voice came from around her chest.</p>
<p>Ara kept her gaze fixed downward while clutching the blanket tightly in both hands.</p>
<p>What was prominently placed on her chest was a white cotton ball.</p>
<p>No, upon closer inspection, it wasn’t a cotton ball. It was a puppy’s front paw, covered in fluffy, white fur.</p>
<p>…A puppy? Why a puppy?</p>
<p>Ara followed the puppy’s slender front leg with her eyes. Finally, she could see the puppy’s full form.</p>
<p>It was a handsome Jindo dog. Ara immediately recognized the breed.</p>
<p>When she was ten and her family moved to the countryside, they had a white Jindo dog named Sawol. Though it was a bit scruffy from living outside, it was fiercely loyal and brave. It had even chased away a wild boar that had intruded into the vegetable garden behind the house.</p>
<p>Now that she thought about it, this puppy did resemble Sawol a little.</p>
<p>Ara quickly forgot the nightmare and was lost in nostalgic memories.</p>
<p>Then, the white Jindo dog lifted its front paw from her chest and patted it firmly. “Get up and feed me quickly if you’re awake.”</p>
<p>It was urging Ara in human speech. She blinked, stunned. She wondered if she was still dreaming, still half-asleep.</p>
<p>No, it couldn’t be.</p>
<p>“A talking puppy? Where in the world is there such a thing?”</p>
<p>“Well, where else but here.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>What is this? This isn’t a dream.</p>
<p>Ara pulled off the blanket she had been clutching and propped herself up. Startled by the sudden movement, the white dog quickly withdrew its paw from her chest and stepped back.</p>
<p>“Wow, that scared me. Move slowly, will you? I almost fell over.”</p>
<p>“Y–you really speak human language…”</p>
<p>“Never seen a talking dog before?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Your experience is quite limited, as expected of a human.”</p>
<p>The white dog spoke with a tone of disdain. Though it was clearly a dog’s face, Ara could distinctly read contempt in its expression.</p>
<p>“Well, it can’t be helped. The wise Baekseol here will have to understand.”</p>
<p>“Baekseol?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I haven’t introduced myself yet, have I?”</p>
<p>Baekseol sat down squarely at Ara’s feet and raised one of its front paws. A soft, pink tummy slightly hidden with fur.</p>
<p>“Hello. My name is Baekseol. I’m a dog spirit.”</p>
<p>Pfft. Ara couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>Though the serious demeanor was one thing, Baekseol’s introduction sounded remarkably similar to a famous anime character’s catchphrase.</p>
<p>“You like anime, huh?”</p>
<p>“What? No way! This introduction is original! I’ve been doing this for thirty-seven years!” Baekseol raised her front paws again and patted the blanket vigorously.</p>
<p>Ara found the sight so endearing that she laughed until her sides hurt. By now, the astonishing fact that a dog was speaking seemed less surprising.</p>
<p>Well, considering she had already met a smartphone-wielding goblin.</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing? Don’t laugh! I’m serious!”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. Baekseol, you’re right. I get it.”</p>
<p>Wiping the tears gathered at the corners of her eyes, Ara nodded.</p>
<p>“So, you should call me ‘Baekseol-nim.’”</p>
<p>Baekseol snorted with a dismissive “Hmph!” and settled its bottom near Ara’s legs.</p>
<p>“You’re only twenty-seven.” And then Baekseol began listing personal details that she hadn’t been told yet.</p>
<p>Ara tilted her head. “Do dog spirits have the ability to guess people’s ages, too? How did you–,”</p>
<p>“It’s Baekseol, not ‘you.’”</p>
<p>“Right, Baekseol. How do you know my age? Can you tell just by looking at my face?”</p>
