        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 9.1</strong></p>
<p>“Ahh, I’m so full. I think I’ll take a quick nap.”</p>
<p>“Eat and nap, eat and nap. You’re not a dog, you’re a cow. A cow.”</p>
<p>After finishing their meal, Baekseol and Seol-do patted their full bellies and headed to the living room. Their bickering voices gradually faded away.</p>
<p>Ara watched them leave with a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>Her gaze fell on the dining table where they had finished eating. The dishes were so clean that they hardly needed washing.</p>
<p>‘Where did you learn to cook?’</p>
<p>‘Wow, you’re pretty good! I’ll overlook the pet food comment just this once. I, Baekseol-nim, hereby appoint you as my personal chef.’</p>
<p>Apparently, the food was to their liking, as both Seol-do and Baekseol praised it in their own ways and had three refills each.</p>
<p>‘…I am just unusually hungry today.’</p>
<p>Even Seok-kyung, who could be as annoying as the Jade Emperor, subtly pushed his empty bowl forward with a strangely flushed face.</p>
<p>‘Ara, dear. Seeing you enjoy your food is the best thing for me. Just watching you eat fills me up. Anytime you want, just say the word. I’ll get up and cook for you, even in the middle of the night. Got it?’</p>
<p>Whenever someone enjoyed her cooking, Ara remembered her grandmother’s words, spoken while patting her head when she was young.</p>
<p>The feeling of being full just by watching someone else eat. Ara now understood that profound happiness. Perhaps she cooked so diligently because she wanted to feel that happiness.</p>
<p>“If you’re done eating, you can leave.” The mischievous goblin brought her out of her thoughts.</p>
<p>“What’s this? You said you wouldn’t go back on your word. Why are you kicking me out again?”</p>
<p>Ara grumbled as she gathered the dishes from the table.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung looked at Ara in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Not in this house, the kitchen. I’ll handle the cleanup.”</p>
<p>His large hand effortlessly took the stack of dishes Ara had gathered.</p>
<p>Ara stood frozen, blinking her round eyes slowly.</p>
<p>Did I just hear that wrong…?</p>
<p>“Kim Seok-kyung.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Are you sick? Did you get indigestion? You seemed to eat well. Let me see, do you have a fever?”</p>
<p>Ara raised her hand and placed it on Seok-kyung’s forehead. Genuine concern was evident in her clear eyes.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung recoiled in surprise, stepping back. The porcelain dishes in his hands clattered precariously.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“No, you’re not. The Kim Seok-kyung I know wouldn’t do something this kind.”</p>
<p>“You have a very refined way of insulting someone.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung shook his head and turned away. Soon, a stream of cool water poured over the dishes in the sink.</p>
<p>What’s going on? They say when a person suddenly changes, it’s a sign of impending death. Could it be the same for goblins?</p>
<p>Ara fidgeted with her hand in her apron pocket and tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Why are you helping me? You’re the one who told me to assume all of the kitchen duties from now on.”</p>
<p>“You know, I thought you only lacked imagination, but your delusions are quite severe too.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung took off his watch and put it in his pocket. With practiced ease, he pumped dish soap onto the sponge.</p>
<p>“I’m not doing this to help you. I’m doing it because I can’t stand it.”</p>
<p>“Can’t stand it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Try living with a mild case of OCD. This is what happens.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung worked the sponge into a lather and started scrubbing the dishes. He meticulously cleaned every surface, removing grease with hot water and paper towels, and double-checked with another sponge to ensure everything was spotless.</p>
<p>If one word could encapsulate his actions, it would be ‘professional.’ That word fit perfectly.</p>
<p>Ara found herself watching his dishwashing with growing interest.</p>
<p>The rhythmic sound of running water and the clinking of porcelain was like white noise, soothing her mind. The sight of his muscles flexing beneath rolled-up sleeves and his profile catching the sunlight added a special kind of pleasure.</p>
<p>“Did Mr. Kim Seok-kyung always do the dishes himself?”</p>
<p>“Who else would I ask? The Jindo dog shedding fur everywhere? He’d break three times as many dishes as he washes.”</p>
<p>The former referred to Baek-seol, and the latter to Seol-do.</p>
<p>Ara imagined Baek-seol and Seol-do shedding fur and breaking dishes and couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>“But you’re a king. I thought you’d have a goblin butler or something for that.”</p>
<p>“I used to. I still call him when I’m really busy.”</p>
<p>“Why not call him more often these days?”</p>
<p>“I need to feel alive.”</p>
<p>The loud rush of water filled the sudden silence, taking its place in the room.</p>
