            <p><strong>Chapter 40.2</strong></p>
<p>“Did I just say something I shouldn’t have? Was that supposed to be a secret?”</p>
<p>Her light brown eyes darted nervously as though searching for an escape.</p>
<p>“No, not at all,” Baekmok reassured her. “I’m just surprised His Majesty told you about that. And impressed, honestly, that you haven’t taken advantage of it.”</p>
<p>Baekmok shook her head gently, the elegant lines of her shoulders lifting in a shrug. Any lingering complexity in her gaze vanished as she dismissed the thought.</p>
<p>“Besides,” she continued, “if you were the type of person to exploit that rule, you’d have done far worse by now. Human greed can sometimes grow large enough to consume their own souls, after all.”</p>
<p>The sharp click of her heels echoed through the quiet corridor.</p>
<p>“If it bothers you so much, just wait a little longer,” she said, her pace slowing gradually.</p>
<p>It was only then that Ara realized the scenery had changed. At the end of the long, stately hallway, a far more modern doorway greeted them.</p>
<p>“After all, the joker is already in your hand,” Baekmok added, her tone light. “If you truly want it, you can hear the truth whenever you choose. But…”</p>
<p>She trailed off, almost as if speaking to herself.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, the sweetest fruits are reserved for those who have the patience to wait.”</p>
<p>With that, she placed her hand on a sleek panel beside the door.</p>
<p><em>Beep.</em> A soft tone sounded as the glass doors slid open.</p>
<p>When their eyes met again, Baekmok was all smiles, her earlier seriousness gone as if it had never existed. She gestured warmly toward the doorway.</p>
<p>“Even the greatest adventures start with breakfast. Shall we talk more over a meal?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The boastful remarks from Seok-kyung and Baekmok were indeed true.</p>
<p>The breakfast prepared by the royal palace’s head chef was nothing short of exquisite. The level of skill was so high that even if someone claimed the main chef had worked at a five-star hotel for decades, it would be entirely believable.</p>
<p>Ara ate far more than usual, feeling completely satisfied, and even took a cup of rich iced Americano to go before heading out for a stroll around the palace grounds.</p>
<p>Baekmok turned out to be a much better guide than Ara expected. Every time a new building appeared, Baekmok offered a brief explanation, answering even Ara’s smallest questions with care and patience.</p>
<p>What stood out most was the central garden of the palace, the same one that Seok-kyung’s office overlooked.</p>
<p>Sitting on the railing of a small wooden pavilion in the middle of the garden, Ara enjoyed watching the passing goblin and the flowers that bloomed according to the season. The sound of water flowing gently and the warmth of the morning sun made her feel like she was on an outing. Perhaps because of her good mood, even the colorful goblin’s hair seemed like petals drifting through the air.</p>
<p><em>For someone kidnapped early this morning, I sure feel strangely happy. Is this… okay?</em></p>
<p>After what felt like a leisurely outing, Ara finally returned to Seok-kyung’s room, two hours later than she had originally planned.</p>
<p>“I’m back.”</p>
<p>The room was quiet. The only difference was that the sunlight now filtered in more deeply than it had earlier in the morning.</p>
<p>No, upon closer inspection, something was missing.</p>
<p>“Seok-kyung?”</p>
<p>The desk where Seok-kyung had been sitting earlier was now empty. There was no trace of his usual quiet voice coming from anywhere in the spacious room.</p>
<p>“It seems like he’s gone to the courtroom,” Baekmok said, lifting her wrist to check the time. She then pulled a remote control from one of the desk drawers. After pointing it at the large glass wall, she pressed a button.</p>
<p><em>Beep.</em></p>
<p>A brief electronic sound rang out, and suddenly, part of the transparent glass window shifted, transforming into a screen and broadcasting a large video.</p>
<p><em>Is this the latest in science and technology? Or some form of supernatural ability that can’t be explained by human logic? Or could it be a mix of both, like a goblin club?</em></p>
<p>Ara was beyond surprised, her jaw hanging open in astonishment.</p>
<p>“He’s over there,” Baekmok pointed with her finger, directing Ara’s attention to the upper-right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>The screen displayed an aerial view of a certain location, much like a CCTV camera. The space, flanked by railings, looked like a royal courtroom.</p>
<p>At the center, on a raised platform where a judge would typically sit, was a grand chair, likely the throne. Seok-kyung was leaning back in this throne, his legs crossed.</p>
<p>He was wearing the same pristine suit he always did, but draped over it was an elaborate royal robe. Rather than being properly worn, it seemed to be casually thrown over his shoulders, its front hanging loosely. Yet, the black silk and the gold-threaded phoenix embroidered on the edges glittered as if alive.</p>
<p><em>What? Wearing that, he really does look like a king. He could be in a historical drama dressed like that…</em></p>
<p>Ara marveled silently, her eyes glued to Seok-kyung’s form. When someone was already handsome, adding such a dramatic look made it all the more striking.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, Ara, this is probably the first time you’ve seen His Majesty in his formal attire,” Baekmok remarked, noticing Ara’s intense gaze.</p>
<p>“How is it? Are you falling for him again?” she teased lightly.</p>
