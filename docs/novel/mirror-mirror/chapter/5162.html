            <p><strong>Chapter 16.1</strong></p>
<p>“No. I’m the personal aide to His Majesty and the overseer in charge of disciplining the goblins.”</p>
<p>Hong-seon sighed, giving Cheong-seon a look of pure disdain.</p>
<p>Now, instead of looking at Hong-seon, Cheong-seon turned to Ara, wearing the most pitiful expression imaginable—like a puppy abandoned on a rainy street.</p>
<p>“You can take him and beat him to your heart’s content.”</p>
<p>Hong-seon handed the chain’s handle to Ara, and Cheong-seon staggered forward a few steps until he was right in front of her.</p>
<p>“Goblins don’t die just because a human beats them.”</p>
<p>To Cheong-seon, this was as good as a death sentence.</p>
<p>Well, that’s convenient. I can beat him without feeling guilty.</p>
<p>Ara tightened her grip on the handle and asked one more question. “He does feel pain when he’s hit, right?”</p>
<p>“Whether human or goblin, pain is the same when you’re beaten.”</p>
<p>“Lee Hong-seon, you cruel goblin…” Cheong-seon muttered, his eyes drooping in defeat.</p>
<p>“Come on.”</p>
<p>Ara tugged the chain sharply, giving Hong-seon a nod before starting to walk away. Cheong-seon, being dragged behind her, began to wail.</p>
<p>“Oh no, poor, handsome Cheong-seon is going to die…”</p>
<p>And with that, it was time for a beating.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Crack. The cap of the soju bottle twisted off with a menacing sound.</p>
<p>Ara’s eyes narrowed as she lifted the bottle into the air. Her hand, flushed pink from the alcohol, fumbled for the mouth of the glass, missing it a couple of times before finally managing to tip the bottle’s neck to the rim.</p>
<p>Glug, glug…</p>
<p>The soju poured out, filling the small glass to the brim and then some.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ara. You’re spilling it.”</p>
<p>Baek-seol, sitting next to her, lightly smacked Ara’s hand with a soft paw. Only then did Ara slowly right the bottle and set it down.</p>
<p>Baek-seol quickly leaned over to the table and lapped up the overflowing alcohol. Slurp, slurp. As the pink tongue efficiently cleaned up the spilled soju, Ara watched in a daze, thinking to herself.</p>
<p>My poor Baek-seol. I really shouldn’t let you get used to eating things off the floor…</p>
<p>“Ara… I think you’ve had enough. Maybe it’s time to stop.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon, who had been cautiously watching her from across the table, spoke up quietly.</p>
<p>“Lee Cheong-seon.” Ara frowned deeply as she lifted her head. “Do you want another punch?”</p>
<p>Seol-do, who had been chewing on a half-dried squid, let out a chuckle.</p>
<p>Without thinking, Cheong-seon quickly covered his nose with his hand. Just a few hours ago, he had stuffed his nostrils with cotton to stop the bleeding, only to remove them recently.</p>
<p>The original plan had been a welcome party. Although Cheong-seon had played a cruel trick on her, the idea of drinking that evening to celebrate her arrival was already set in stone before she trampled him earlier.</p>
<p>After her little smack to his face, Cheong-seon had groveled, claiming that he had promised Seol-do and Baek-seol a night of heavy drinking.</p>
<p>“But a promise is a promise, right? I mean, I did lend Ara the Goblin invisibility cap, and she did take it and use it…”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon, as a tricker that he was, still honors contracts and promises and urged Ara to honor her part of the bargain despite fooling her.</p>
<p>Smack.</p>
<p>As she heard that, Ara gave Cheong-seon a soft slap on the back. It irritated her even more that, logically speaking, he wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>But later that night, Ara found herself standing in front of the kitchen sink. She felt a twinge of guilt for punching Cheong-seon, though she couldn’t help but wonder if it had really been that bad. Did it actually bleed?</p>
<p>She hadn’t seen any blood, but Cheong-seon had acted as if a fountain had erupted from his nose. She grumbled to herself, Goblins are such mischievous creatures…</p>
<p>Pulling out ingredients from the fridge one after another for a late-night snack, she couldn’t help but rationalize her actions.</p>
<p>Yes. I’m not like that con artist goblin. If I make a promise, I keep it. And I don’t use cheap tricks to put others in a tough spot.</p>
<p>And so, close to midnight, a boisterous drinking session unfolded in the living room of Seok-kyung’s house.</p>
<p>Just as Ara had prepared an impressive spread of side dishes as promised, Cheong-seon had brought an array of alcoholic beverages that could rival a well-stocked liquor store.</p>
<p>Each goblin picked a drink that suited their taste. Seol-do chose Kaoliang liquor, Baek-seol some makgeolli, Cheong-seon went for whiskey, Hong-seon picked wine, and Seok-kyung opted for brandy.</p>
<p>After a moment of hesitation, Ara decided on soju. Given her usual tolerance, she knew she should have gone with a can of beer, even if it felt a bit tame.</p>
<p>Little did she know, the Goblin King’s eyes had been watching her every move.</p>
