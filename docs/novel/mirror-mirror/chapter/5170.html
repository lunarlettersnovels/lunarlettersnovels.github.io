            <p><strong>Chapter 12.1</strong></p>
<p>A lunatic?</p>
<p>Before Ara could even figure out who it was, a head with bright blue hair popped out from behind Seol-do.</p>
<p>“Well, well, who do we have here! Isn’t it our beautiful, cute, and lovely Princess Baekseol!”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon showered Baekseol with sweet talk as he rushed towards her. Practically rolling on the ground, he tightly hugged the fluffy Baekseol and rubbed his cheek against her fur.</p>
<p>“How long has it been? About a week? I thought I was going to die from missing you. Didn’t you miss Cheong-seon, our Princess Baekseol? Huh? Huh?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, get away. Don’t bother me.” Baekseol replied curtly, pushing Cheong-seon’s face away with her front paws.</p>
<p>However, her tail, which couldn’t lie, kept hitting Ara’s calf. It seemed she was genuinely happy to see him.</p>
<p>“Still as adorably sassy as ever. Cheong-seon could die happy right now. If I die, write this on my tombstone: ‘Poor and handsome Lee Cheong-seon passed away from a heart attack caused by the overly cute Princess Baekseol.’”</p>
<p>Baekseol snorted but nestled into Cheong-seon’s arms. Cheong-seon grinned widely and gently lifted Baekseol, placing her carefully on a chair as if she were a princess.</p>
<p>“You two are making a scene, a scene.”</p>
<p>Seol-do, sitting across from them, grumbled.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? That’s our Hong-seon’s specialty.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon shrugged and sat next to Seol-do.</p>
<p>Just then, Hong-seon entered the restaurant with Seok-kyung. He waited until Seok-kyung passed by him, then suddenly threw his smartphone at Cheong-seon.</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“See, he’s a pro at it.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon quickly turned and caught the smartphone, giggling. It wasn’t his first time catching something like that.</p>
<p>“Ara, you really made Dongchimi noodles.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. There was some Dongchimi in the kimchi fridge. I just needed to cook the noodles.”</p>
<p>“Really touching. I won’t forget this kindness.”</p>
<p>“Eh? It’s not really a big deal…”</p>
<p>Ara felt a bit embarrassed by the unexpected praise when Seok-kyung casually spoke up from across the table.</p>
<p>“Just accept it.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s casual comment was accompanied by a slight shrug.</p>
<p>“The goblin said they’d repay you. Who knows, they might even bring you a lottery ticket.”</p>
<p>Is that so?</p>
<p>It made sense. The smartphone Hong-seon had tossed earlier had the same design as Seok-kyung’s. It was probably a goblin’s magic wand, so it was likely that Cheong-seon had one, too.</p>
<p>A magical wand that could make anything appear out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“Alright then, Cheong-seon. Don’t forget this favor.”</p>
<p>It was worth taking a chance. Ara responded with a bold smile and picked up her spoon. Cheong-seon grinned back, seemingly understanding.</p>
<p>Despite his youthful appearance, which looked to be in his early twenties, Cheong-seon was quite handsome, though not as much as Seok-kyung. He was cute, while Hong-seon was the cold, aloof type.</p>
<p>“But I have a question.”</p>
<p>Ara paused with her spoon in mid-air and looked at Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Are all goblins naturally handsome and beautiful?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung stopped using his chopsticks and frowned.</p>
<p>Seol-do and Hong-seon also froze for a moment, exchanged glances, and then silently resumed eating.</p>
<p>Only Cheong-seon suddenly burst into laughter, clutching his stomach.</p>
<p>“No, but seriously. Seol-do is incredibly beautiful. And Cheong-seon and Hong-seon are handsome too.”</p>
<p>Ara explained in a flustered manner, trying to justify her question.</p>
<p>“Of course, our Princess Baekseol is the best among them.”</p>
<p>After a brief silence, she hastily added.</p>
<p>Baekseol looked at Ara with a satisfied expression, as if to say, “That’s my dedicated caretaker.” A grain of white rice was stuck to the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>Feeling a pang of guilt, Ara smiled even more brightly and removed the rice from Baekseol’s nose.</p>
<p>That was close.</p>
<p>“Ara.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon, who had finally managed to stop laughing, looked at Ara with a meaningful expression.</p>
<p>“What about our Geumsang Jeonha? Do you think he’s handsome?”</p>
<p>“Kim Seok-kyung?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Kim Seok-kyung.”</p>
<p>“Lee Cheong-seon. Shut up and eat.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung warned.</p>
<p>“What? Our Geumsang Jeonha is giving impossible orders again. How can I eat with my mouth closed? Should I eat through my nose? Or maybe my ears?”</p>
<p>However, Cheong-seon didn’t back down and continued to joke around. He even leaned more conspicuously towards Ara’s side.</p>
<p>“Ara, answer me. Is our Geumsang Jeonha handsome?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Well… yes, he is. He is very handsome.” Ara admitted readily.</p>
