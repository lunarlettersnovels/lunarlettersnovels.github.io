            <p><strong>Chapter 13.1</strong></p>
<p>Ara put down her spoon entirely and turned to face Seok-kyung. Her head tilted slightly as she rested her face on her hands.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung glanced at Ara but remained silent.</p>
<p>“See? She’s a quick learner, always catching on fast.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon made finger guns with both hands and pretended to shoot at Ara, even winking with one eye.</p>
<p>“Ugh.” Seol-do pretended to gag and went to get more stew.</p>
<p>“Let’s get back to the point. You were curious why our Geumsang Jeonha is so exceptionally handsome, right?” Cheong-seon continued, unfazed by Seol-do’s antics, maintaining the demeanor of a top instructor.</p>
<p>“Goblins’ human appearances are greatly influenced by the form of their original objects.”</p>
<p>“Like how your hair is blue, Hong-seon’s hair is red, and Seol-do’s hair is white?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. But it’s not just about the color. The effort and materials that went into creating the original object determine how detailed and beautiful the goblin’s human form will be.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>
<p>“The mirror that is Geumsang Jeonha’s original form… is a hand mirror adorned with pure gold and twenty-eight types of gemstones.”</p>
<p>“Gasp…”</p>
<p>Ara’s mouth fell open. Pure gold and twenty-eight types of gemstones? She couldn’t even name that many gemstones.</p>
<p>“Now you can guess how extravagant Geumsang Jeonha’s original form is just by looking at his face, right?”</p>
<p>Ara nodded, almost entranced.</p>
<p>‘Do you not realize how handsome you are?’</p>
<p>‘I know.’</p>
<p>‘I am quite an exceptional beauty. It’s because of my origin.’</p>
<p>Ara recalls their conversation when they first met. Now, she could understand why Seok-kyung had said that. With such a precious mirror as his original form, it made sense to call his origin special.</p>
<p>“But that’s a bit strange. The original mirror is made of gold and gemstones, so why is Kim Seok-kyung’s hair black?”</p>
<p>“Being a mirror goblin, he’s very interested in fashion. He changes his hair color frequently.”</p>
<p>Indeed. With his colorful suits, metallic watches, leather shoes, and silk ties, he could easily pass for a fashion magazine model.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because mirrors are tools for checking appearances?</p>
<p>Ara pondered deeply, then suddenly remembered something she had forgotten.</p>
<p>“Right. So, who is the Yeonwon? Whose mirror was Kim Seok-kyung originally?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s…”</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>A loud noise erupted from across the table. It was the sound of a spoon clashing harshly against the marble tabletop.</p>
<p>“How long are you going to chatter at the dining table?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung glared at Cheong-seon with an irritated expression.</p>
<p>His voice was sharper than usual, causing not only Hong-seon and Seol-do but even Baekseol, who had her head buried in her bowl, to take notice.</p>
<p>“If you have more to say, talk after the meal.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon immediately shut his mouth and sat up straight. He brought the now-soggy dongchimi noodles in front of him and gave Ara a quick nod.</p>
<p>Ara returned an awkward smile to Cheong-seon.</p>
<p>Though she was smiling, she didn’t feel like smiling at all. The excitement she had felt moments ago had vanished, replaced by a subtle sense of discomfort that was slowly taking over.</p>
<p>Does he not want to tell me who his Yeonwon is?</p>
<p>Ara picked up her spoon again. Seok-kyung’s face, which she glanced at once more, was now covered with a strangely cold shadow.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After the meal, Seok-kyung shooed everyone out, saying they were in the way of cleaning up. That included Ara.</p>
<p>Seol-do took Baekseol outside, saying they were going for a post-lunch walk. Hong-seon also disappeared to the third floor, claiming he had urgent matters to attend to.</p>
<p>In the end, only Cheong-seon and Ara were left in the living room.</p>
<p>Ara sat on the sofa, hugging a cushion and tapping her toes. The sound of running water at a steady pressure could be heard from the nearby kitchen.</p>
<p>In the morning, she could hear Seok-kyung’s voice mingling with that water sound. Strangely, she didn’t have the nerve to approach him now.</p>
<p>‘Ara, get a grip. Did you come here to sightsee?’</p>
<p>‘How long are you going to chatter at the dining table?’</p>
<p>Those cold words echoed in her ears like a hallucination.</p>
<p>Cheong-seon, who had been fiddling with his smartphone for a while, looked at Ara, who seemed oddly melancholic.</p>
<p>“Ara.”</p>
<p>Knock, knock. Cheong-seon lightly tapped the coffee table to get her attention.</p>
