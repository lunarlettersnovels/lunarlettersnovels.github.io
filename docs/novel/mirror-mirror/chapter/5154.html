            <p><strong>Chapter 20.1</strong></p>
<p>Ara fully embraced the role of a newlywed, her demeanor as bright and charming as a young bride showing off her husband. She flashed a warm smile at the shopkeeper with not a hint of awkwardness in her expression.</p>
<p>“You’re a smart one, dear. Pure sesame oil is so precious these days, you can’t even buy it with money.”</p>
<p>“Of course! My husband loves the greens I toss in sesame oil. And are you really giving us the perilla oil too? His sister is quite fond of that. You remember her, don’t you? She’s the tall one who always comes with him.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I remember. She was here with him every time.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s expression was a mix of disbelief and frustration as he watched the two women engage in friendly banter. His incredulous gaze lingered on Ara, who was still clinging to his arm.</p>
<p>“You really married well, Mr. Kim. It’s not every day you find a wife who looks out for her sister-in-law too,” the shopkeeper remarked, mistaking Seok-kyung’s exasperation for something more affectionate.</p>
<p>“Just wait here for a bit. I’ll be right back,” the shopkeeper added before leaving to fetch the oil.</p>
<p>As soon as she disappeared into the back, Seok-kyung yanked his arm free from Ara’s grasp. The shopping bag he held fell to the ground, spilling the vegetables across the floor.</p>
<p>“Look here, Na Ara.”</p>
<p>“What? Are you going to call me a three-time offender now? Yes, I suppose I am,” Ara retorted with a dismissive snort as she crouched down to gather the scattered vegetables, her hands moving deftly.</p>
<p>“Who told you to pretend to be the newlywed first? You started this,” she grumbled just loud enough for him to hear.</p>
<p>When there was no response, Ara glanced up at Seok-kyung, trying to gauge his reaction. His face seemed slightly flushed, and his gaze was a bit unsteady, avoiding hers.</p>
<p>Maybe he was embarrassed to be caught up in such a situation with a mere human, or perhaps he was simply at a loss for words. Either way, Ara couldn’t help but think that maybe, just maybe, she had finally managed to fluster the unflappable Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>Ara felt a surge of satisfaction, a smile on her face as she reveled in her small victory.</p>
<p>“And why didn’t you accept the sesame oil? We’re almost out at the mansion, and you know how hard it is to find good, pure sesame oil these days. When someone offers it as a gift, you should just say ‘thank you’ and take it.”</p>
<p>“No.” Kim Seok-kyung made his refusal clear.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, no?”</p>
<p>“Human kindness comes with a debt.”</p>
<p>With a sigh, Ara finally stood up after gathering all the scattered vegetables. The heavy bag of produce landed on the counter with a thud.</p>
<p>“Honestly, just admit it. Did you get scammed in a real estate deal back in the day?”</p>
<p>“What?” Seok-kyung frowned, his expression darkening.</p>
<p>Ara, mimicking his usual behavior, crossed her arms and clicked her tongue disapprovingly. “Humans call that kind of kindness ‘generosity,’ you know.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung quickly glanced around, checking the entrance to the storeroom and the shop’s exit. Once he confirmed they were alone, he lowered his voice.</p>
<p>“I’m not human, and for me, kindness without a price is just another burden that I have to repay.”</p>
<p>“Is it because you, Kim Seok-kyung, are particularly cold-hearted?” Ara asked, her innocent expression belying the boldness of her words.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung hesitated, unsure where to begin correcting her, then finally let out a resigned sigh.</p>
<p>“…It’s a rule for goblins.”</p>
<p>Ara pondered his words, tilting her head thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“So, if a goblin receives human kindness, they’re obligated to repay it. Is that what you’re saying?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>Ara shrugged nonchalantly. “Then just accept it and repay the favor.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung stared down at her, his gaze unreadable.</p>
<p>“What’s so complicated about it? The grandma isn’t giving us a gift because she expects something big in return. She’s just happy that her regular customer got married and is blessing us to live well together.”</p>
<p>The situation was completely foreign to him—utterly incomprehensible, really. Normally, he would have shut down the conversation with a sharp retort, reminding her that goblins had their own laws and rules. He hadn’t sought her understanding, nor did he need to convince her.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you feeling guilty because you lied about being a newlywed?” Ara teased.</p>
<p>“I never lied. It’s you who poured oil on the fire of that human’s misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>Yet, despite everything, why did he always find himself explaining things to her?</p>
