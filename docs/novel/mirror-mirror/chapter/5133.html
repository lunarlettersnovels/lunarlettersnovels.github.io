            <p><strong>Chapter 30.2</strong></p>
<p>“You’re… the quack?” Ara asked, her confusion deepening.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Hong-seon reassured her with a calm smile. “It’s not that I lack skill, just that I don’t have an official license.”</p>
<p>Isn’t that basically the same thing?</p>
<p>Ara stared at him, unsure whether to trust him. Hong-seon, however, didn’t bother explaining further. Instead, he gestured politely toward the empty sofa.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a moment, Ara reluctantly sat down. Hong-seon knelt on the floor next to her, carefully inspecting her wounds before opening his bag.</p>
<p>“Other than your wrist and ankle, are there any other injuries?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No, nothing else that’s turned this black,” Ara replied, glancing at the ominous dark marks on her skin.</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Hong-seon nodded and pulled a sleek silver case from his bag. Inside was a long, ornate needle.</p>
<p>“What’s the plan? Not that she’s going anywhere before dinner,” Cheong-seon chimed in suddenly.</p>
<p>Without even turning to look at him, Hong-seon replied while gripping the needle firmly. “Fortunately, it’s not too severe. But still, inform His Majesty. If it’s a malevolent spirit strong enough to cause physical harm, he should know.”</p>
<p>“Roger that.”</p>
<p>Roger that? What kind of ancient goblin talks like that? He looks more like a college kid who streams video games.</p>
<p>Ara could only shake her head in disbelief as she watched Cheong-seon, now fiddling with his smartphone, squeeze into the seat next to Baekseol.</p>
<p>“Excuse me for a moment,” Hong-seon said as he adjusted the grip on the needle and firmly held Ara’s wrist.</p>
<p>“This is a fire needle,” he explained. “It’s used to scrape away malevolent and impure energies. With this, I’ll burn away the dark energy inside you.”</p>
<p>“Wait, you’re going to scrape and burn?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I won’t be scraping everything away—just writing a single character. The burning will only affect the dark energy, so don’t be too scared.”</p>
<p>Yeah, right. Like Hong-seon wouldn’t be scared himself.</p>
<p>Ara swallowed her complaints, realizing that if she didn’t remove this horrible thing soon, she might actually die.</p>
<p>“Please try to… make it as painless as possible.”</p>
<p>“Honestly, that’s not really something I can guarantee,” he replied.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Just hold on. It’s going to hurt a little.”</p>
<p>The moment his calm but ominous prediction ended, the sharp tip of the needle began to scrape against Ara’s wrist.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Ara flinched, pressing her mouth shut with her other hand. A searing pain surged through her, unlike anything she had ever experienced, spreading like wildfire through the wind.</p>
<p>A little? He said it would hurt a little?</p>
<p>Hong-seon’s words were nothing but a blatant lie. This felt less like a needle and more like self-inflicted harm with a heated blade.</p>
<p>“If you move, we’ll have to start over from the beginning.”</p>
<p>As if he could read her desire to yank her arm away, Hong-seon warned her in a cool voice.</p>
<p>Ara clenched her fist, swallowing back a groan. Tears streamed down her cheeks involuntarily.</p>
<p>It hurt too much. She couldn’t even see what letters Hong-seon was writing on her arm or how the dark energy was being burned away. All she could do was pray and hope that this hellish moment would end quickly.</p>
<p>“Done.”</p>
<p>In what felt like thirty years, thirty seconds passed.</p>
<p>As Hong-seon finished the final stroke of the character, he pulled the needle away. The angry red mark that had been burning like a flame transformed into a dark stain in the shape of the character.</p>
<p>The letters, infused with dark energy, crumbled to ash and vanished as if they had never harmed Ara. The intense pain that had felt like fire also disappeared.</p>
<p>Ara gasped, exhaling the breath she had been holding. Her eyes, now drenched with tears, looked up at Hong-seon.</p>
<p>“Can… can we do my legs tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“We can, as long as you’re still alive by then.”</p>
<p>He sure knows how to draw out a ‘no.’</p>
<p>Sniffling, Ara stretched her legs toward Hong-seon. Given the choice between unbearable pain and death, she had no choice but to choose the former.</p>
<p>“Hmm? What’s with the spiritual gate now…?”</p>
<p>It was then that Cheong-seon, who had been fiddling with his smartphone on the other sofa, murmured. His gaze was fixed beyond Ara, toward the window facing the garden.</p>
<p>Hong-seon, who had also turned to look, frowned in confusion.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>While Ara was trying to gauge their reactions, the front door suddenly swung open, and hurried footsteps rushed in.</p>
<p>“Lee Cheong-seon! I heard that a malevolent spirit attacked Na Ara. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>The person froze in the doorway as if hitting the brakes abruptly, wearing half-removed leather shoes.</p>
<p>It was then that Ara blinked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Kim Seok-kyung?” A tear that had been welling up finally rolled down her cheek at that moment.</p>
