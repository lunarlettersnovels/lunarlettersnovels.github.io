            <p><strong>Chapter 41.2</strong></p>
<p>“If he gets sick, it’ll be a big problem. If you think he’s reaching his limit, secretly contact Cheongseon or Hongseon. I’ll make sure to sneak in something like a laxative in his meal and put him to bed,” Ara suggested half-jokingly.</p>
<p>“Oh my, such a simple method. I’ll keep that in mind,” Baekmok responded with a playful laugh.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the scene on the screen began to change.</p>
<p>Below Seok-kyung, three goblin were walking in line through a corridor. Two goblin on either side held the arms of the one in the middle, who was wearing something on his wrist.</p>
<p>A silver ring, faintly glowing with a cool blue light.</p>
<p>Ara had seen that before. Not just seen it, but she had once been the one dragging the goblin wearing it along.</p>
<p>“Wait, the goblin wearing the spirit seal is the criminal, right?” Ara asked.</p>
<p>Baekmok’s face showed surprise once again.</p>
<p>“You know about the spirit seal?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Hongseon told me about it. On the day he beat up Lee Cheongseon.”</p>
<p>“Oh, the day Cheongseon came to the palace with a bruised face.”</p>
<p>Looks like the rumor has spread around the office, huh? That’s what you get.</p>
<p>Ara silently snorted, recalling the annoying face of Cheongseon. She knew that the teasing her superior had received wouldn’t make up for the humiliation she had felt that day.</p>
<p>‘If I left you to die like that, I would’ve felt uneasy. After all, you are a human I made a contract with.’</p>
<p>Ara now understood the words Seok-kyung had spoken back then in a completely different way.</p>
<p>Had the protective charms, made by sharing his life force, and saving her from danger, all been part of a measure to fulfill the promise made by him as a king? Had it all been to ensure the contract he had made would be safely upheld?</p>
<p>It wasn’t because he considered her family, or because they had shared meals, or because he wanted to know her better, was it?</p>
<p>Ara stared at Seok-kyung on the screen. Her soft, gentle gaze faltered, unknowingly showing signs of sadness.</p>
<p><em>No, no. Don’t be greedy, Ara. Don’t take on a responsibility you don’t have to. After all, he wouldn’t let me die, would he?</em></p>
<p>As the inexplicable feeling of being slightly hurt turned her thoughts upside down, Seok-kyung, still looking down at the lower stage, moved his lips. His face, likely preparing to pass judgment, had turned colder than ever.</p>
<p><em>So he can look so terrifying too, this goblin. He seemed like a completely different person.</em></p>
<p>Ara felt an unexpected sense of disappointment, even in this unfamiliar side of Seok-kyung. His dark brown eyes, reflecting various shadows, glanced towards the window, trying to hide his unease.</p>
<p>The guilty goblin, on the other hand, knelt and struggled desperately as if trying to make a final effort. His body twisted in agony as he screamed, though Ara heard no sound.</p>
<p>Like watching a silent film, the emotionless screams were silenced, the absence of sound making her more detached. It almost felt like it helped her observe the situation with a cold, indifferent perspective.</p>
<p>Ara tightly clenched her fist. The strange disconnect made her feel even stranger.</p>
<p>“His Majesty has passed judgment,” Baekmok spoke, breaking the silence in the room.</p>
<p>“The punishment will be carried out soon.”</p>
<p>Ara blinked slowly, her face tense with worry.</p>
<p>On the screen, Seok-kyung slowly rose from his seat. He spoke briefly to the goblin below the platform. Ara wished she could read his lips, but it wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>Then, Seok-kyung flicked his fingers, and a bright light appeared from his empty hand.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, what appeared was a ring. The same one he had used to inscribe strange characters into his body the first time they met in the abandoned house.</p>
<p>The ring emitted numerous letters, just like before, flowing out to form a band of symbols. Seok-kyung slowly extended his hand toward the goblin below, as if letting the characters flow toward him.</p>
<p>The letters, maintaining a precise distance from one another, circled the goblin, binding him with an invisible force.</p>
<p>At that moment, the other two goblin, who had been restraining the guilty one, stepped back and bowed to Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Ara instinctively covered her mouth in surprise.</p>
<p>Flames flickered from the inside of the swirling characters, igniting into a brilliant blue fire. The flames quickly grew in size, roaring as they devoured everything within their circle, leaving no trace behind.</p>
