            <p><strong>Chapter 36.1</strong></p>
<p>“These days, do ladies communicate with their shoulders instead of words?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung clicked his tongue and raised a finger, tapping lightly near his own shoulder.</p>
<p>“I-it’s not like I’m showing this for you, Kim Seok-kyung!”</p>
<p>Ara hastily yanked up the neckline of her shirt. Unfortunately, covering her left shoulder only caused the right one to slide down instead.</p>
<p>“Yes, milady. Perhaps you should first tame that unruly nightwear before delivering your lecture.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung mockingly adopted the tone of a medieval nobleman. With one hand resting on his chest, he gave her a slight bow, resembling a gallant gentleman inviting a lady to dance at a ball.</p>
<p>Flushing bright red, Ara clutched at her wayward neckline, which seemed determined to betray her.</p>
<p><em>Why does he have to be so ridiculously good-looking even when he’s being insufferable? This is just unfair.</em></p>
<p>As Ara silently fumed, her tightly pursed lips began to twitch against her will.</p>
<p>“Why the sulky face? You wouldn’t be in this predicament if you’d just gotten up when I knocked,” Seok-kyung said, his keen eyes catching even the smallest hint of her frustration.</p>
<p>“…You knocked? I didn’t hear it.”</p>
<p>“I did. For a full five minutes, no less.”</p>
<p><em>Five minutes…</em></p>
<p>Even a saint would have barged in after that long. At least he hadn’t resorted to slapping her awake to check if she was still alive.</p>
<p>Still, what if I’d been sleeping stark naked? What then?</p>
<p>“So what do you want?”</p>
<p>Ara tugged the disheveled blanket draped over her bed and pulled it over her shoulders.</p>
<p>“We’re going somewhere. Get ready and come out.”</p>
<p>She froze mid-motion, tilting her head at an angle.</p>
<p>“This early in the morning?”</p>
<p>“This early in the morning.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“You’ll see when we get there.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s reply was utterly unhelpful, delivered with unwavering calm.</p>
<p>Ara was beyond exasperated—she was floored.</p>
<p><em>Unbelievable. The nerve of this tyrant! Barging into my room before dawn isn’t enough—now I have to follow him to God knows where, just because he says so?</em></p>
<p>“I can’t go.”</p>
<p>But her response wasn’t purely out of preference.</p>
<p>“I mean, not right now.”</p>
<p>Ara tilted her chin toward the clock hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>“It’s almost time to start preparing breakfast.”</p>
<p><em>If the landlord holding billions tells you to go, you go—even if it’s to hell itself. But I have to finish making breakfast first.</em></p>
<p>Besides, Baekseol, hungry and irritated, was likely to be just as terrifying and fierce as a grumpy Kim Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>“There’s no one to eat, so why bother preparing breakfast?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s rebuttal came as if her words were utterly absurd.</p>
<p>Ara didn’t understand at first, tilting her head in confusion. But then her round eyes narrowed into sharp slits as she glared at him.</p>
<p>“Wait, don’t tell me… you’re planning to starve Baekseol now?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean, even if you’re concerned for me, isn’t that going too far? You said Baekseol is like a benefactor to me! Everyone makes mistakes, whether they’re human or… canine spirits. How can you not feed her? Especially after you fed her just fine last night!”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“How can you be such an awful king? If you’re going to punish someone, at least be consistent! Feed her, let her rest, <em>then</em> punish her some other way—”</p>
<p>“Ara.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung, who had been silently enduring Ara’s torrent of words, finally interrupted.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Did you hit your head somewhere when you got hurt yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to change the subject now?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m serious—”</p>
<p>His sigh fell heavily at Ara’s feet, still cocooned in her blanket.</p>
<p>“There’s no one home.”</p>
<p>“So you’re changing the story agai— What?”</p>
<p>“Cheongseon, Hongseon, Nam Seol-do, and Baekseol—they all left. They’ve got things to do.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“That’s why I said there’s no one to feed breakfast to.”</p>
<p>Ara clutched the edge of her blanket tighter, her pale cheeks flushing into a fiery red, like ripened apples.</p>
<p>“You didn’t seriously think I was punishing you or something, did you?”</p>
<p>Now Seok-kyung wasn’t just poking fun; he was battering her with his words.</p>
<p>“Ara, you’re not some princess with a delusional complex, are you? Of course, you wouldn’t think that. Right?”</p>
<p>This wasn’t even comparable to being physically hit. In fact, dying a noble death by sword or spear, like in her recent dream, seemed far preferable.</p>
<p>Speechless and flustered, Ara sank further under the covers while Seok-kyung glanced at his wristwatch.</p>
<p>“Thanks to your dawdling, we’re short on time. I’ll give you exactly five minutes—get rid of your sleep crust, change, and come out.”</p>
<p>He turned, retrieved a bag from the nearby nightstand, and tossed it unceremoniously onto the bed in front of her.</p>
<p>“Oh, this is…”</p>
<p>The familiar bag was the eco-bag Ara had left behind on Daeyasan. Inside, even her phone was neatly tucked away.</p>
<p>“I moved the bugleweed to the front yard, near the zelkova tree. If you want to replant it in a pot and keep it here, go ahead.”</p>
<p><em>What? Did he go out of his way to retrieve all of this? For me?</em></p>
<p>Ara, moved by the gesture, was about to express her gratitude.</p>
<p>“If you’re late again, I won’t knock next time.”</p>
<p>Crash. The swelling wave of gratitude shattered spectacularly.</p>
<p>Leaving behind what was essentially a threat, Seok-kyung turned on his heel and left the room.</p>
<p>“Arghhh…!”</p>
<p>Through the crack in the closing door, Ara’s frustrated thrashing and muffled screams echoed as she furiously kicked her blankets.</p>
<p>Leaning against the wall next to her door, Seok-kyung chuckled softly.</p>
<p>With arms crossed, he waited for the door to open again, listening to the commotion beyond the thin wooden barrier as if it were a lively tune.</p>
<p>…It had been a long time since he felt this alive.</p>
