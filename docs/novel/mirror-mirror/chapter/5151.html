            <p><strong>Chapter 21.2</strong></p>
<p>Seok-kyung, acting as if he were invisible, casually gathered his things and turned away. This move conveniently shielded Ara, who peeked out from behind him to observe the situation.</p>
<p>“Hey, you! Where’d you hide the girl who was here?”</p>
<p>Ara lost all color to her face once the thugs called Seok-kyung. It turns out he wasn’t invisible at all.</p>
<p>The larger thug, his face scarred near the cheekbone, asked in an annoyed tone, looking all the more intimidating.</p>
<p>“No idea.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s indifferent response, without so much as a raised eyebrow, only made the thug’s expression twist even more menacingly.</p>
<p>“No idea? This guy’s got a real mouth on him.”</p>
<p>“Yes. You seem a bit like that too.”</p>
<p>“What did you say, you bastard?!” The thug reached out his enormous hand like a lid from a pot, but Seok-kyung nimbly sidestepped, narrowly avoiding his grasp.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this move brought Seok-kyung dangerously close to Ara. The gap between them suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>“You’d better not lay a hand on me, Ara.”</p>
<p>“What?” Ara was in disbelief– how is he still able to mock her in their current position?</p>
<p>The aggravated thug reached out again, but Seok-kyung hesitated before taking another step back. Ara’s breath was already brushing the nape of his neck.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung ultimately abandoned any thought of retreat.</p>
<p>Just as his broad back stood firmly in front of Ara, the thug grabbed him roughly by the collar.</p>
<p>“You’re really going to regret this.”</p>
<p>Even as his collar was seized, Seok-kyung remained calm. Tilting his head slightly, he looked down at the thug and muttered nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“This bastard’s all talk, huh?” The thug raised his free hand high, ready to strike.</p>
<p>Ara, who had been holding her breath while watching, instinctively gripped Seok-kyung’s jacket at the waist. Even though she wasn’t the one about to be hit, her eyes squeezed shut in reflex.</p>
<p>But Seok-kyung didn’t even flinch. There was no terrifying smack or thud, no violent clash.</p>
<p>Ara cautiously opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, a hand appeared, grabbing the thug’s wrist and pulling it down.</p>
<p>Upon recognizing the owner of that hand, Ara pressed herself even closer to Seok-kyung’s back, her lips tightly pressed together. Her slender fingers gripped his already crumpled jacket even tighter, nearly tearing it.</p>
<p>“Let’s not cause a scene with so many people around. How about we cooperate while I’m asking nicely? Where did you hide that girl?”</p>
<p>The voice belonged to Mr. Jang, the boss of this thug gang and the devil who had once handed Ara a waiver to surrender her limbs with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung glanced briefly over his shoulder, confirming Ara’s pale face before returning to Mr. Jang.</p>
<p>“If I tell you, will you believe me?” There was now a cryptic smile on Seok-kyung’s lips.</p>
<p>“That depends on what kind of crap you’re spouting,” Jang sneered, clearly entertained by Seok-kyung’s defiant attitude.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung stared at him for a moment before nodding toward his own shoulder.</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>He even raised his hand and pointed directly at the top of Ara’s head.</p>
<p>“She’s right here.”</p>
<p>Behind Seok-kyung, anyone could see that there was nothing but empty air.</p>
<p>For a moment, even Mr. Jang and the other thugs forgot to be angry. The absurdity of Seok-kyung’s statement took a moment to fully sink in.</p>
<p>“What the hell is he playing at?”</p>
<p>But the one most bewildered was Ara.</p>
<p>“Can’t you see her?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung brushed off her protest and stepped to the side. Ara’s grip on his jacket loosened as the fabric slipped from her grasp.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she found herself standing face-to-face with Mr. Jang.</p>
<p>Of course, he couldn’t actually see her, but from Ara’s perspective, they were so close that a single reach from him could snatch her away.</p>
<p>“This guy’s nuts. What kind of game is this?”</p>
<p>The big thug, finally regaining his senses, swung his arm up again.</p>
<p>“Why ask if you don’t believe me?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung clicked his tongue as he stepped aside, standing right next to Ara.</p>
<p>“Look closely. I told you, she’s right here.”</p>
<p>Then, before Ara could protest or even understand what he was doing, Seok-kyung grabbed her wrist.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” she started to ask, but Seok-kyung didn’t give her the chance.</p>
<p>He lifted her hand and waved it back and forth as if signaling.</p>
<p>“Ara, come on. Say hello. You’re right here.”</p>
