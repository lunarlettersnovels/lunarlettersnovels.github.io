            <p><strong>Chapter 2.2</strong></p>
<p>“Is that so? Anyway, I’m not a criminal.” Just as the man was about to argue, Ara quickly added. “But you’re not a person, are you?”</p>
<p>“…” The man did not retort. She does have some points.</p>
<p>“Article 319 of the Criminal Code. It clearly states from the first sentence: ‘a person’s residence’, blah blah blah.”</p>
<p>This time, instead of a verbal retort, the man’s sharp gaze bore down on her. “What makes you so fearless?”</p>
<p>The man asked, his face filled with suspicion.</p>
<p>“I just found out today that I’m this fearless.” Ara shrugged. The lack of reality seemed more pronounced to her than to the man. It felt more convincing that this was a dream.</p>
<p>“Who sent you?”</p>
<p>“No one sent me. I came here alone.”</p>
<p>“Why did you come here?”</p>
<p>“Well… I thought if I hid here, people wouldn’t be able to find me.”</p>
<p>“Hide?”</p>
<p>“Um, it’s embarrassing, but I ran away. I suddenly ended up with a huge debt.”</p>
<p>Ara confessed impulsively and then realized her mistake. She had hidden herself deep in the mountains to escape people, only to reveal her situation so easily.</p>
<p>Still, assuming he really was a goblin, which was ridiculous but seemingly true, he probably wouldn’t go running to those awful loan sharks to rat her out… right?</p>
<p>Just as she reached this thought, the man unexpectedly leaned forward and grabbed her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Wait, let go, let’s talk this out… talk!” In an instant, Ara turned pale and grabbed the man’s arm with both hands.</p>
<p>Despite her desperate efforts to push him away, the man didn’t budge an inch. If necessary, she needed to kick him in a vital spot and run, but her legs, exhausted from the arduous hike, refused to obey.</p>
<p>What should I do? Am I really going to die here?</p>
<p>Grandma, I’m sorry. I should have listened to you when you said this place was cursed…</p>
<p>“Ow!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, her shoulder felt as if it had been pricked by a needle.</p>
<p>Ara glanced at the shoulder the man was gripping and couldn’t believe her eyes.</p>
<p>Between his long, sturdy fingers, a dazzling ring was glowing. The ring, crafted with a gold band and a large green emerald, sparkled as if it were a light source itself. Mysterious characters streamed from the center of the ring.</p>
<p>The characters formed a precise line, swiftly piercing through Ara’s chest and then retracting back into the ring, which lost its light almost immediately.</p>
<p>“Wh-what is this…?”</p>
<p>Ara stammered, reflecting on the magical moment. The needle-like pain had vanished completely.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, the man shook off her hands and straightened up. When he shook his right hand, the ring disappeared as if it had never been there.</p>
<p>“You really are just a human.”</p>
<p>His voice carried a hint of disappointment as if he couldn’t comprehend what had just happened.</p>
<p>Ara was equally baffled, unable to make sense of what had transpired.</p>
<p>“Get down.”</p>
<p>The next words were even harder for Ara to process.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I made a mistake. You’re just an ordinary human who isn’t worth bringing in.”</p>
<p>…Mistake? Not worth bringing in?</p>
<p>Ara bit her lip in frustration. Each word from the goblin was infuriating, but that was secondary now.</p>
<p>“When you go back, I’ll close the gate of the Maze Garden, so you won’t get lost for long.”</p>
<p>“Maze Garden? What’s that… No, that’s not the point. Goblin man, wait.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter if you don’t keep it a secret that you met me. Everyone will just think it’s crazy talk anyway.”</p>
<p>“No, I was thinking of getting down from here.”</p>
<p>“Ah. Be careful on the way down. Unfortunately, mountain beasts are not my concern.”</p>
<p>The man spoke as if he didn’t hear Ara’s protests. Not only that, but he tidied up the scattered belongings with a flick of his finger and tossed them into Ara’s arms.</p>
<p>“Well then, goodbye.”</p>
<p>With that, he turned away without hesitation.</p>
<p>Ara didn’t have time to think. She threw the bag he had handed her to the ground and, instead, crawled over and grabbed the hem of his pants.</p>
<p>“I can’t go down from here.”</p>
<p>The man sighed, seemingly exhausted by her desperate plea.</p>
<p>“Let go.”</p>
<p>“My legs hurt; it’s too late, and if I go down, I’ll die.”</p>
<p>“I see. That’s unfortunate. But what does that have to do with me?”</p>
<p>“Wow, listen to you. You’re really heartless.”</p>
<p>“You can finish cursing me on your way down. Now let go. Do you want me to remove your hands myself?”</p>
<p>The man slightly moved his fingers, ready to use his powers to break her grip.</p>
<p>Ara quickly changed tactics. She dramatically released his pant leg and plopped down, crossing her arms.</p>
<p>“Hey. Isn’t this too much? Who kicks out a helpless woman in the middle of the night?”</p>
