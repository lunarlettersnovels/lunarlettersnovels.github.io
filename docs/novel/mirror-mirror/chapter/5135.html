        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 29.2</strong></p>
<p>Ara nodded without fully understanding what she was agreeing to.</p>
<p>“But… what was that form you just had?”</p>
<p>“Well, if I had to explain it simply, think of it as my armor. I need that level of power and intimidation to tear apart vile creatures like that.”</p>
<p>Baekseol puffed out her chest proudly.</p>
<p>Ara didn’t understand exactly how it worked, but it seemed Baekseol had transformed into a divine form to drive away the black creature.</p>
<p>“Baekseol-nim, you’re really a divine dog, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“What? You didn’t believe me? I told you several times! I’m even better in a fight than Nam Seol-do!”</p>
<p>Baekseol’s tail thumped the ground in clear frustration at Ara’s disbelief. The splash of mud from her tail sent ripples through the once-still puddle.</p>
<p>Ara shuddered, her shoulders trembling involuntarily. Just watching the waves ripple on the surface reminded her of the terror she had felt moments before. It wrapped around her throat like a tightening noose.</p>
<p>“Ara.”</p>
<p>Baekseol, ever sensitive, noticed the shift in Ara’s state. She could see the signs of panic rising again. And she knew better than anyone that, in times like this, words were less important than actions.</p>
<p>Moving slowly to avoid startling her, Baekseol approached Ara, leaning in as if offering a comforting embrace.</p>
<p>“W-wait. I’m all dirty from the mud…”</p>
<p>Ara stammered, pulling her shoulder back slightly.</p>
<p>“Quiet. You’re my subordinate; you talk too much.”</p>
<p>Baekseol pressed one of her soft paws against Ara’s thigh, firmly but gently. Then, as she often did, she sat down right next to Ara, her warm body leaning against her legs.</p>
<p>“There. Now take deep breaths and gently pet me. Nothing calms the mind like a cute puppy.”</p>
<p>Baekseol rested her head against Ara’s neck, snuggling closer. The warmth and the soft fur tickled Ara’s skin in a soothing way.</p>
<p>Without thinking, Ara followed Baekseol’s advice. She took a deep breath, then slowly exhaled.</p>
<p>“Baekseol, thank you for saving me…”</p>
<p>Ara whispered her thanks as she began to lift her arm.</p>
<p>“Ow!”</p>
<p>A sharp pain, as if a thousand needles had stabbed into her wrist, struck suddenly.</p>
<p>“What? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Sensing something was off, Baekseol quickly backed away.</p>
<p>Ara clutched her right wrist with her uninjured left hand. The pain she had momentarily forgotten in the midst of her terror came rushing back all at once.</p>
<p>“Let me see.”</p>
<p>Baekseol nudged Ara’s hand aside with her nose and gently used her paw to wipe away the mud covering her arm.</p>
<p>What was revealed was a dark, hand-shaped mark on her previously smooth wrist. It looked like a bruise, but darker and more mottled, with an unusual sting despite the lack of blood or serious abrasion.</p>
<p>Baekseol’s expression grew grim as she examined the mark closely. Then she bared her teeth, growling with a low, simmering anger.</p>
<p>“That vile creature… it left a curse on you. Just like a wretched *<em>Sigi</em>* would.”</p>
<p>Vile creature? Curse? Sigi?</p>
<p>Ara tilted her head in confusion at the unfamiliar terms.</p>
<p>“What… what was that thing earlier? A ghost?”</p>
<p>“Yes. A thoroughly wicked spirit. It took advantage of the shifting paths in the labyrinth to attack you.”</p>
<p>Baekseol explained calmly at first but then abruptly shifted, slapping Ara’s arm repeatedly with her paw.</p>
<p>“That’s why I told you to come quickly! Why didn’t you listen?! Why?!”</p>
<p>“Ow! It hurts—seriously, it really hurts. Ah, ahh…”</p>
<p>Ara winced and whimpered with each strike, her pale face quickly flushing red from the sharp pain.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Baekseol snorted, irritated, before lowering her paw with a huff.</p>
<p>“You’re such a troublemaker. What good is being able to cook if you never listen?”</p>
<p>Ara, with a sullen expression, wrapped her arms around her wrist again.</p>
<p>“Baekseol, why do you have to worry so violently?”</p>
<p>“Worry? Who said I was worried? What’s there to like about a subordinate who never listens?”</p>
<p>Baekseol, caught off guard, huffed even louder, clearly offended. Ara pouted as she rubbed the injury on her wrist.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. My bones seem okay… It’s probably just a slight sprain. I’ll go home, put some ointment on it, and I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“No, human medicine won’t fix this.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Ara frowned at the unexpected response.</p>
<p>“What do you mean it won’t heal?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Ara, do you get motion sickness?”</p>
<p>Instead of explaining, Baekseol asked something completely unrelated.</p>
<p>“Uh… no? I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“What? What’s good?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m going to carry you back home now.”</p>
<p>Ara’s eyes widened at the sudden declaration.</p>
<p>“Wait, carry me? Why?”</p>
<p>“Because you’re not walking on that foot.”</p>
<p>Baekseol motioned toward Ara’s ankle, which bore the same mark as her wrist. Then, without waiting for an answer, she transformed back into her enormous, divine form.</p>
<p>Ara froze, staring up at Baekseol, not out of fear this time but in sheer disbelief. When someone’s utterly shocked, words just don’t come.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to fall and break something, stay still.”</p>
<p>With a light grip that could’ve easily swallowed her whole, Baekseol clamped her jaws around Ara’s waist.</p>
<p>“Wait, hold on. Ack! Baekseol, it’s too high! Baekseol-nim! Hey! Ahhh!”</p>
<p>Her belated struggles only worsened the pain from her injuries.</p>
<p>In the end, Ara half-fluttered through the air, eyes squeezed shut.</p>
<p>Oh, if only all of these were just a dream…</p>
