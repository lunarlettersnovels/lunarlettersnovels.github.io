            <p><strong>Chapter 16.2</strong></p>
<p>Ara’s lingering shame pushed her to make a bolder choice. It didn’t help that Seol-do, declaring her the guest of honor, had seated her next to Seok-kyung at the head of the table.</p>
<p>Yeah. This embarrassment isn’t something that beer can wash away. I’ll need soju to forget this.</p>
<p>With that, Ara bravely opened the soju bottle.</p>
<p>“Na Ara.”</p>
<p>Every time Seok-kyung’s voice echoed in her mind, she emptied her glass as if trying to drown out the memory.</p>
<p>“Can’t you stop touching me?”</p>
<p>Another glass.</p>
<p>“Do you always touch others so freely? You’ve got some bad habits.”</p>
<p>One more glass.</p>
<p>“Na Ara, didn’t I tell you before? Let’s live smarter.”</p>
<p>Another glass.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, she was already on her third bottle. Normally, just one bottle of soju was enough to knock her out, so she was well beyond her limit.</p>
<p>Ara blinked slowly, her vision blurring. The soju bottle standing upright in front of her seemed to waver like a mirage. Her unsteady hand reached out, grasping at nothing but air.</p>
<p>This isn’t good. I need to drink more. Stop wavering, you stupid bottle. Just stay still…</p>
<p>“Na Ara.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s voice cut through her foggy thoughts.</p>
<p>“I think the welcome party is over.”</p>
<p>Ara slowly turned her head towards the source of the low voice. Through her hazy vision, she saw Seok-kyung moving her soju glass out of the way.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kim Seok-kyung.”</p>
<p>“Hey?” Seok-kyung furrowed his brow at the sudden informal address. Seol-do snorted with laughter once again.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you. Kim. Seok. Kyung. Do you have any idea… how much…”</p>
<p>Do you know how much you embarrassed me today? Do you?</p>
<p>Ara scrunched up her nose like a puppy deprived of a treat. “You… bad guy.”</p>
<p>And then she began to ramble. “Why couldn’t you just… pretend not to notice? Hmph.”</p>
<p>She picked up a silver chopstick from the table and pointed it at Seok-kyung’s face.</p>
<p>Staggering, swaying.</p>
<p>The world was shaking as if an earthquake had struck, yet Seok-kyung’s frowning face remained crystal clear.</p>
<p>Clatter. Ara’s chopstick slipped from her fingers, falling to the table with a weak clink.</p>
<p>“But you… your blond hair… it’s really pretty. Everything suits you so well, it’s ridiculous.” Her slurred words echoed through the quiet living room.</p>
<p>Ara had no idea.</p>
<p>From Seok-kyung’s bewildered expression to Hong-seon, who was fiddling with his tablet even during the drinking session, everyone was witnessing her drunken ramblings in real time.</p>
<p>“Just you wait.”</p>
<p>Ara slammed her fist on the table. Ouch… She misjudged her strength, and her hand throbbed with pain. She cradled her aching hand to her chest and glared at Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>“I’m definitely… going to pass that test… and get my ten billion, with interest…”</p>
<p>She raised her uninjured left hand, pointing directly at Seok-kyung’s face.</p>
<p>“And then… I’m going to flatten that perfect nose of yours.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung let out a sigh, suddenly finding himself the target of an impromptu declaration of war.</p>
<p>“No, no, wait… I take it back. That nose is a national treasure.”</p>
<p>Ara quickly corrected herself, waving her hand frantically. The alcohol in her breath was potent, and she could feel her energy waning.</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll… I’ll spank you instead…”</p>
<p>The drunken drowsiness was something Ara could no longer fight against.</p>
<p>With those final words, she slowly closed her eyes. Her head, now too heavy to hold up, tipped sideways.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung, unfortunately seated next to her, looked down at the head now resting on his shoulder in disbelief.</p>
<p>Have I lived too long? I swear, I’ve seen everything now.</p>
<p>He carefully tried to shift away, tilting his shoulder to slide out from under her.</p>
<p>But luck was not on his side. Thud. This time, Ara’s head dropped onto his thigh instead of his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>As if Seok-kyung’s leg were the most comfortable pillow in the world, Ara snuggled into it and smacked her lips in contentment.</p>
<p>“Kim Seok-kyung… you suck.”</p>
<p>Her blunt insult was swallowed up by her soft, sleepy breathing.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung stared down at the slumbering Ara, utterly dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Her innocent face was now serene as if she had forgotten all the worries of the world. The chandelier’s light cast delicate shadows under her long eyelashes.</p>
<p>Thump, thump.</p>
<p>At that moment, the warmth of her cheek and neck pressed against his leg sent an unfamiliar heartbeat through him. The rhythm of it was so powerful that it made his own heart match pace, almost as if he had no choice but to surrender to it.</p>
<p>Like a stream flowing into a river and a river merging with the sea.</p>
<p>“Your Highness.” The voice that broke through his deep thoughts was Seol-do’s.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung lifted his gaze from Ara and looked at Seol-do.</p>
<p><em>Click.</em></p>
<p>At the same time, the sound of a camera shutter echoed in the room as Seol-do raised his smartphone, capturing the moment.</p>
