            <p><strong>Chapter 31.2</strong></p>
<p>What had started as a defense to spare Baekseol from taking the blame kept building, words upon words, until her emotions became like a snowball gathering size and speed.</p>
<p>She was so terrified, so desperate for someone to save her, so hurt, so afraid… and only Baekseol was there to save and console her.</p>
<p>The goblin king couldn’t even offer her a single word of comfort, yet he scolded the one who did, making her feel even worse.</p>
<p><em>“Who’s troubling you? Tell me who it is.”</em></p>
<p>Why had he even said such things if he was going to act like this now? Pretending to care, as if he would do anything to help.</p>
<p>“Why are you so angry? Why!” Ara shouted with all her strength. She had tried not to cry, but the sobs that had built up inside her finally broke through.</p>
<p>Maybe this was all her own fault.</p>
<p>She had read too much into things, gotten her hopes up alone, and been disappointed all by herself.</p>
<p>She had wanted them to see her as someone special and dear, to find comfort, understanding, and even concern in their company, despite the circumstances.</p>
<p>So foolish. So painfully foolish…</p>
<p>Ara collapsed onto the ground, and like a child who had lost her parents, began to wail. She knew it was a scene, that it might look pathetic, yet she felt helpless against the force of her emotions.</p>
<p>“Ara, don’t cry. What’s wrong…”</p>
<p>In the midst of everyone’s stunned silence, only Baekseol approached, wrapping herself around Ara. There was a profound gratitude in her expression as she held her close.</p>
<p>“I know I made a mistake. And he was just worried about you, Ara. So, please, don’t cry, okay? If you cry, it’ll make me want to cry too…”</p>
<p>Baekseol nuzzled against Ara’s neck, sniffling as well. Her dark eyes glistened with tears, and soon enough, a long, mournful howl escaped her.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung watched the surreal scene silently. He could have scolded them both for their display of helplessness, but his lips remained tightly shut, offering no rebuke.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, perhaps this is enough for today. They both need some time to calm down; they’ve been through a lot. Punishment can wait,” Seol-do said, clucking her tongue as she held both Ara and Baekseol close, patting them gently. Receiving her cue, Cheong-seon stepped forward to stand in front of them, his expression softening into a somewhat awkward smile.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung pressed his fingers to his throbbing temple. A long sigh slipped from his barely parted lips.</p>
<p>“…Lee Hong-seon.”</p>
<p>Although he called for Hong-seon, his gaze remained fixed elsewhere.</p>
<p>“See to it that they’re properly treated.”</p>
<p>No matter how deep a breath he took, his chest still felt tight—especially as his mind kept drifting to someone’s tear-stained face, lingering in his thoughts.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Knock knock.</em></p>
<p>A light tapping on the door broke the silence.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung, slumped back in a plush chair, slowly opened his eyes. His golden-ringed irises absorbed the darkness that filled the room.</p>
<p>How much time had passed? Since rushing into the room, lost in pointless thoughts, he had long lost track. He hadn’t bothered to turn on the lights or open the blackout curtains, so there was no way to judge time by the sunlight outside.</p>
<p>“King, I’m coming in.”</p>
<p>Before he could even ask who it was, the door swung open. Seok-kyung tilted his head slightly toward the door in response.</p>
<p>It was, of course, Seol-do—who hadn’t waited for permission to enter, only notifying him of her approach.</p>
<p>Of course, this was natural. In this house, only Seol-do had the audacity to treat him so casually.</p>
<p>Well, that is…until <em>she</em> arrived.</p>
<p>“I didn’t say you could come in,” he muttered.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung murmured quietly, trying to erase the one name that kept clouding his mind.</p>
<p>“You didn’t tell me not to come in, either,” Seol-do replied cheekily, her tone faintly echoing a familiar presence.</p>
<p>Was he under some spell, he wondered, some enchantment so subtle that he hadn’t even noticed it? Ever since that uninvited guest entered this house, Seok-kyung found himself doing things completely out of character—behaving strangely, with no rational explanation.</p>
<p>“She’s healed up well, no lasting effects,” Seol-do continued nonchalantly. “And with how she clung to Baekseol, anyone would think they’d lived together for twenty years. At this rate, they might as well make a sworn pact of brotherhood.”</p>
<p>Seol-do shrugged as if baffled.</p>
<p>A small relief, at least, Seok-kyung thought, though he’d need to look further into the strange creature she encountered.</p>
<p>Relief? he suddenly questioned himself. What was there to be grateful for, and why did he feel it?</p>
<p>“Didn’t ask,” he muttered.</p>
<p>“I know. I just wanted to tell you.”</p>
<p>“Then get out if you’re done. I’m tired.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung turned to face forward again, closing his eyes. His voice sounded annoyed, and his brow was still furrowed, yet his hidden gaze felt somehow more at ease.</p>
<p>Seol-do looked down at him, her lips curling in slight amusement as she crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just admit it?” she teased. “You were worried sick about her.”</p>
