            <p><strong>Chapter 18.1</strong></p>
<p>“Why not? That would be more convenient.”</p>
<p>“Going to the market is a hobby Seok-kyung quite enjoys. Even if you try to stop him, he won’t listen.”</p>
<p>Is going to the market part of his ‘ritual’ to feel alive?</p>
<p>Ara briefly thought of Seok-kyung’s indifferent face, then waved her hand to clear the distracting thoughts. This wasn’t the time to calmly understand his situation.</p>
<p>“Seol-do, I’m being pursued by loan sharks. What if I get caught by them while we’re out at the market?”</p>
<p>“You’re worried for nothing. With the goblin king beside you, what’s there to worry about?”</p>
<p>“But Seok-kyung might abandon me.”</p>
<p>If it’s that troublesome goblin, he might very well do that. Ara shivered involuntarily, imagining the worst.</p>
<p>“Na Ara.”</p>
<p>Seol-do called her name and extended her hand, seeming to signal her to take it and stand up.</p>
<p>Ara took Seol-do’s hand and stood up. Due to their height difference, her gaze tilted slightly towards him. “You still don’t know our king very well.”</p>
<p>Seol-do spoke with the certainty of someone who had no doubt. Her voice held no room for hesitation.</p>
<p>“Or maybe, just as he doesn’t know you, you don’t know him either. It’s only natural, after all. How much can you know someone after just two days?” Seol-do urged, “So go with him. Some things can only be understood by experiencing it firsthand.”</p>
<p>Seol-do patted Ara’s shoulder as if she were her older sister.</p>
<p>“Plus, you didn’t bring much with you, did you? While you’re at it, buy some underwear, pajamas, and casual clothes. Just buy everything you need.”</p>
<p>Seol-do pulled a stack of yellow bills from her training suit pocket and shoved them into Ara’s hand.</p>
<p>“This much is more than I need.” Startled by the amount of money, Ara looked at Seol-do, who shrugged as if to say, “Is that all?”</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Aren’t you going to get ready? Do you want to go out looking like a drunk beggar?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An hour later.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung stood in the sunny courtyard, waiting for Ara.</p>
<p>Initially, he had planned to go alone. When Seol-do told him to go to the market with Ara instead, Seok-kyung had flatly refused, saying it was nonsense.</p>
<p>“Why? Are you scared to go out without me? Or is it that you’re scared to be with Na Ara?” But Seol-do’s cunning trap of prodding was too crafty.</p>
<p>Scared? Me? Let’s get real. What reason could a thousand-year-old goblin have to fear a fragile human woman?</p>
<p>“Then go together. After all, there are only two people in this house who know how to cook. It’s better to have two pairs of eyes on the ingredients.”</p>
<p>Even though he knew it was a childish stubbornness, Seok-kyung couldn’t defeat Seol-do’s insistence. Or rather, he didn’t.</p>
<p>From Seok-kyung’s perspective, it was simply a matter of conceding a minor point due to annoyance. Seol-do was still a young goblin by seniority, but stubborn and immensely strong.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung clicked his tongue and stomped on the innocent grass, feeling a flush of heat rise from his chest, perhaps due to the stifling breeze.</p>
<p>Why is she taking so long? She said she’d be out soon.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung clicked his tongue inwardly, just as the front door opened. Ara hurriedly tied up her slightly damp hair and ran out.</p>
<p>“Even a caterpillar would be faster than you.” Again, that mischievous mouth of his.</p>
<p>Despite the usual scolding, Ara found herself inadvertently feeling relieved.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Is everything okay now? Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Ara snapped back and turned her head sharply. Just as she took exactly three steps toward the distant iron gate, Seok-kyung’s voice came from behind her.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?” A puzzled voice came from over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Where else would we go? We’re heading to the market.” Ara pointed at the door.</p>
<p>“But why are you going that way? That door leads to the labyrinth, and going through it will take you straight to the abandoned neighborhood of Soyasan.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. The market is at the base of the mountain, right? We need to get out of here first.”</p>
<p>Tsk. Seok-kyung instantly adopted a haughty expression and clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“Hey, Na Ara.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You weren’t planning to walk down the mountain, were you?”</p>
<p>“Then how are we supposed to get there?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s lips curled into an elegant smirk as he slowly raised his right hand.</p>
<p>Snap.</p>
<p>As the crisp sound of his finger snap echoed through the courtyard, the scenery behind Seok-kyung slowly unraveled.</p>
<p>Ara stared in disbelief at the scene before her.</p>
<p>She thought she was adapting to this strange world, only to realize how arrogant that thought had been.</p>
<p>“Wow.” Ara gasped in awe without even realizing it.</p>
<p>What appeared behind Seok-kyung was a kind of entrance. A large, round passage with a bluish glow outlining its edges.</p>
<p>Ara looked at the entrance, which resembled what one might call a portal in games. Beyond it, a completely different view from the goblin house’s yard was visible.</p>
<p>“goblin can do things like this?”</p>
<p>“Not all of them, but some can.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung nodded lightly.</p>
<p>Possible, but not all goblin have this ability. After a brief moment of calculation, Ara raised her hand to point at Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>“So, only exceptional goblin like Kim Seok-kyung can do this?”</p>
<p>Ara’s face showed the anticipation of a student waiting for the correct answer.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung looked at Ara, folded his arms, and tilted his head slightly. A playful smile adorned his neatly composed lips.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re not completely foolish after all.”</p>
