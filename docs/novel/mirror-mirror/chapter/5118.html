            <p><strong>Chapter 38.2</strong></p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s focused demeanor revealed subtle nuances—an occasional furrow of his brows or the slight arching of one. When mulling over something, he twirled a digital pencil around his fingers or tapped his temple lightly while resting his chin on his hand. At times, he picked up a fountain pen to sign documents on paper.</p>
<p>“This is this week’s security layout for the main palace,” Baekmok said, handing over a file.</p>
<p>“These are the new goblins registered in the <em>Heoju-rok</em> today. If you check the names below…”</p>
<p>“Have you reviewed the cooperation memo from the <em>Siwangcheong</em>?”</p>
<p>“We also need to notify the <em>Chilseonggak</em> secretary office about your attendance at the next council meeting…”</p>
<p>Standing beside him, Baekmok swiftly swapped out the necessary documents and materials, seamlessly assisting him. Though the distance was considerable, the room’s acoustics allowed fragments of their conversation to drift over to Ara. However, there wasn’t much to glean—just that Seok-kyung’s workload was both vast and varied, encompassing matters from the heavens above to the earth below.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>‘I told you I’m busy.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Do you have to bring up being busy every time we talk? Are you handling the entire world’s workload alone?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Yes.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘…What?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Only I can do my job. After all, there’s only one King of Goblins in the world.’</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>So, he wasn’t exaggerating,</em> Ara thought to herself.</p>
<p>Time flowed quietly, like a gentle river, as the three became absorbed in their respective tasks and thoughts. Ara had already emptied her first cup of tea and was halfway through her second when Baekmok finished organizing a stack of approved documents. She placed them back into the cabinet and retrieved another batch from a different one.</p>
<p>“These are the Sangseon brothers’ memorials. And this stack here contains lawsuits submitted by the Ministry of Justice.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung quickly assessed the volume of paperwork split between both sides of his desk. Almost unconsciously, his gaze shifted toward where Ara sat.</p>
<p>Their eyes met briefly, a quiet moment of acknowledgment cutting through the hum of their contrasting paces.</p>
<p>As soon as their eyes met, Seok-kyung, who had been staring at Ara moments earlier, quickly feigned nonchalance. He resumed twirling his pencil idly, though the faint blush spreading across his pale ears betrayed his composure.</p>
<p>“There’s still some time before the ruling is due. Review it thoroughly and prepare at your pace,” Baekmok said, her tone steady but with a hint of amusement. She glanced at Seok-kyung as if enjoying some private joke, then turned her attention back to Ara, walking over with a warm smile.</p>
<p>“Have you been waiting long?”</p>
<p>“No, not really. I’ve been entertained just by looking around,” Ara replied casually.</p>
<p>Baekmok cast a sly glance toward Seok-kyung, seated at his desk, and nodded leisurely.</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose the view is captivating.”</p>
<p>Ara nearly choked, hastily setting her teacup down with a sharp clink. “No, no! Not that—”</p>
<p>“How’s the tea?” Baekmok interrupted smoothly, steering the conversation away with practiced ease as she took a seat across from Ara.</p>
<p>Ara coughed into her hand and rubbed at her mouth. “It’s good. Lightly sweet, just how I like it.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad. I hope the meal suits you as well.”</p>
<p>“…Meal? You’re giving me food too?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Breakfast is soon, isn’t it? The palace’s head chef is quite talented. I doubt you’ll be disappointed.”</p>
<p>Baekmok’s cheerful grin was accompanied by her pouring herself a fresh cup of tea. A delicate floral fragrance rose into the air.</p>
<p><em>Breakfast at the goblin palace…</em> Ara’s thoughts trailed off. What would it taste like? Would it resemble food from the human realm? She licked her lips reflexively, only to realize Baekmok was watching her closely. Embarrassed, she quickly shifted the conversation.</p>
<p>“Is Kim Seok-kyung always that busy?”</p>
<p>“Yes, most of the time,” Baekmok replied, setting her cup down with a soft clink against its saucer.</p>
<p>“Spiritual beings in the human realm are the most overworked,” she explained, her tone light but matter-of-fact. “It’s partly because they’re closest to humans and partly because they’re caught between the heavens and the underworld, so they have to cooperate with both sides.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“But His Majesty insists on personally overseeing everything. Even tasks he could easily delegate are all reviewed by him.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a competent but exhausting boss,” Ara remarked wryly.</p>
<p>Baekmok brightened at her comment, laughing softly. “Ara, you and I are going to get along just fine. In some ways, he’s a bit obsessive. Even more meticulous than the late king, who was already known for his fastidiousness.”</p>
<p>Ara nodded subtly in agreement. From the way Seok-kyung had fussed over washing dishes, she could tell he was no ordinary goblin. If he put so much care into mundane chores, there was no way he would be careless or irresponsible about the decisions he made as king.</p>
<p>“That’s why I was so shocked, you know,” Baekmok continued, her voice dropping into a more conspiratorial tone. “When His Majesty stormed out of the council meeting.”</p>
<p>Ara tilted her head, caught off guard. “Stormed out? Why?”</p>
<p>Baekmok leaned in closer, her tone playfully scandalized. “Because of you, of course.”</p>
