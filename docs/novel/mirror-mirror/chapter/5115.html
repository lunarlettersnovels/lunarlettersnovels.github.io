            <p><strong>Chapter 40.1</strong></p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Ara flatly denied it, her tone brimming with defiance. Her clear eyes glimmered faintly, as though injustice itself were swimming within them.</p>
<p>For a brief moment, Baekmok hesitated, questioning if her judgment about the nature of their relationship had been mistaken.</p>
<p>That is, until Ara blurted out something entirely unexpected.</p>
<p>“It’s not Kim Seok-kyung who’s entranced by me. I’m the one who’s entranced by him!”</p>
<p>Baekmok, uncharacteristically caught off guard, found herself at a rare loss for words.</p>
<p>Ever since the other goblin at the sacred grounds had unanimously agreed Ara was no ordinary human, Baekmok had suspected she might be an outlier. But now, she realized Ara was even more extraordinary, and eccentric, than she had imagined.</p>
<p>“Honestly, that face should be illegal. What human wouldn’t fall for a goblin that good-looking, especially when he keeps popping up right in front of them?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“So of course, I keep letting his annoying little pranks slide. But that’s not my fault! It’s his fault for being so ridiculously handsome…”</p>
<p>Here she was, a human woman complaining about being bewitched by the stunning looks of a goblin king, so much so that she even made him worry enough to act out of character. Yet somehow, she managed to frame the entire ordeal as her being the victim of his unfair attractiveness.</p>
<p>“Ara, you truly are… a very special human being.”</p>
<p>Baekmok knew with certainty now: she could live another thousand years and never meet anyone like this woman again. She was beginning to understand why Seok-kyung, the proud and solitary king, kept breaking his own rules over Ara.</p>
<p>Or rather, why the once aloof, untouchable king couldn’t seem to stop himself.</p>
<p>“…Wait. Are you insulting me in a roundabout way?”</p>
<p>Unaware of Baekmok’s musings, Ara misinterpreted her words and pouted.</p>
<p>“No, not at all. I swear it’s pure admiration,” Baekmok replied, placing a hand over her heart as if making a solemn vow.</p>
<p>Then, tilting her head slightly, she met Ara’s eyes with a thoughtful look, as if something new had just occurred to her.</p>
<p>“By the way, Ara, do you know about <em>yeonwon</em>?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Cheongseon explained it to me once before.”</p>
<p>Hearing the casual way Ara addressed Cheongseon, Baekmok let out a soft laugh.</p>
<p>“You seem to have gotten quite friendly with the goblin who come and go from the sacred grounds. Cheongseon isn’t the type to casually share something like that.”</p>
<p>“Really? I just figured his mental age was about that of an elementary schooler, considering how often he pulls childish pranks.”</p>
<p>Ara frowned, recalling the humiliation she had endured thanks to one of Cheongseon’s particularly immature tricks.</p>
<p>“Anyway, there’s something I’ve been curious about,” she said, exhaling deeply to steady herself before swiftly changing the subject.</p>
<p>“Who is your <em>yeonwon</em>, Baekmok?”</p>
<p>“Who do you think it is?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… If I had to guess, I’d say someone elegant and brilliant. Like a highly capable professional woman?”</p>
<p>“That’s a fair assumption. You’re quite perceptive.”</p>
<p>Baekmok smiled gently, lightly tapping the corner of her eye as though pleased with Ara’s guess. Buoyed by the praise, Ara beamed back at her.</p>
<p>“My <em>yeonwon</em> is Lady Minhoe-bin.”</p>
<p>“Minhoe-bin…? You mean Lady Kang, the wife of Crown Prince Sohyeon?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. My physical form is the white jade hairpin Lady Minhoe-bin used until the <em>sosang</em> ceremony for her late husband, Crown Prince Sohyeon.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing the explanation, Ara found Baekmok’s silvery-white hair shining even more brightly in her eyes. The natural grace and commanding, resolute demeanor Baekmok exuded now made perfect sense. They were a seamless match for the <em>yeonwon</em> who had been such a strong, enduring presence in her time.</p>
<p>“Wow. That suits you so well, Baekmok.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for the compliment.”</p>
<p>Baekmok winked playfully in response.</p>
<p>“But now that we’re on the subject,” Ara began, sensing an opportunity, “there’s something else I’m suddenly curious about. May I ask?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Go ahead.”</p>
<p>Baekmok’s permission came without hesitation.</p>
<p>Ara glanced cautiously around the empty hallway, then stepped closer to Baekmok, lowering her voice as though about to reveal a secret.</p>
<p>“Do you think there’s something tragic about Kim Seok-kyung’s <em>yeonwon</em>? Like… is there some unwritten rule that no one is allowed to talk about the <em>yeonwon</em> of the goblin king?”</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled with curiosity, growing brighter as her question unfolded.</p>
<p>Baekmok narrowed her eyes slightly before her usual serene expression returned.</p>
<p>“So, His Majesty hasn’t told you about his <em>yeonwon</em> yet.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, it’s less that he <em>hasn’t</em> told me and more like… he just <em>won’t</em>,” Ara trailed off, hesitant to articulate her thoughts fully.</p>
<p>“If you’re that curious, why not ask His Majesty directly?”</p>
<p>“At first, I thought about it,” Ara admitted, “but then I realized it might not be…”</p>
<p>“Not be what?”</p>
<p>“Well, goblin aren’t allowed to lie to humans, right? Forcing him to tell me something he doesn’t want to say feels… unfair.”</p>
<p>Ara hadn’t even finished speaking when Baekmok’s brow furrowed slightly. She waited patiently for Ara to finish before breaking the silence.</p>
<p>“You know about goblin laws?”</p>
<p>“Not everything, just bits and pieces. Kim Seok-kyung mentioned them a few times; the things goblin can’t or shouldn’t do.”</p>
<p>Ara answered without thinking but then noticed Baekmok’s peculiar expression. The realization hit her, and she clamped her hands over her mouth.</p>
