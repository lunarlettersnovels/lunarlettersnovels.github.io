            <p><strong>Chapter 38.1</strong></p>
<p>Ara turned to find the source of the voice. Seok-kyung’s gaze also shifted toward the doorway.</p>
<p>Click-clack. The distinct sound of high heels echoed as an extraordinarily beautiful woman approached. She appeared to be in her early thirties, with a neat bob haircut and a white suit that exuded a professional aura.</p>
<p>But what truly captured Ara’s attention was the woman’s striking white hair.</p>
<p><em>…Do all pretty female goblins have white hair?</em></p>
<p>That silly thought crossed her mind as she stared at the woman’s hair, which glowed with a mystical whiteness. It was a stark contrast to Seol-do’s hair. While Seol-do’s white hair resembled cold silver, this woman’s hair was closer to a warm ivory hue.</p>
<p>“Baekmok,” Seok-kyung called out as the woman came closer.</p>
<p><em>Baekmok? That name sounds familiar…</em></p>
<p>Ara was just about to dig into her hazy memory when the woman bowed gracefully and spoke, confirming her identity.</p>
<p>“Greetings to Your Majesty the King.”</p>
<p>She addressed Seok-kyung with impeccable etiquette, her voice polished and melodic.</p>
<p>“I was wondering what caused your rare tardiness…”</p>
<p>Her words trailed off as she glanced meaningfully between Ara and Seok-kyung, a faint smirk gracing her lips.</p>
<p>“I see. When you’re in the prime of your life, priorities tend to shift.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung frowned slightly, clearly displeased by her insinuation. But before he could refute her remark, Baekmok turned to Ara, her expression brightening.</p>
<p>“Pleased to meet you. I’m Baekmok.”</p>
<p>Baekmok extended her hand for a handshake, her demeanor warm and inviting.</p>
<p>Ara hesitated for a moment before grasping her hand and giving it a light shake. “Hello. I’m Na Ara. You probably know this already, but… I’m human and contracted with him.” She gestured toward Seok-kyung with her chin as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. I know very well,” Baekmok replied, covering her mouth with her hand as she chuckled. It wasn’t a mocking laugh but rather one of amusement, as though she’d stumbled upon something entertaining.</p>
<p>Ara, who had been wary that Baekmok might be as mischievous as the Sangseon brothers, felt her tension ease at the other woman’s mild response.</p>
<p>“I am the Deputy Master of this palace and the representative of our ever-busy king. To put it in terms you’d understand from modern Korea… think of me as the equivalent of a prime minister.”</p>
<p>Ara nodded, her agreement instinctive. As she naturally moved to release Baekmok’s hand after the handshake, Baekmok instead clasped it with both hands and took a step closer.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard so much about you, Ara, from the Sangseon brothers and Seol-do. They said that His Majesty has, for the first time—”</p>
<p>“Stop spouting nonsense and get to work.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung, ever perceptive, cut Baekmok off mid-sentence.</p>
<p><em>There he goes again, clamping down on anything interesting,</em> Ara thought with an internal click of her tongue as Seok-kyung briskly walked off toward the large desk in the center of the room, clearly finished with the conversation.</p>
<p>“When he gets grumpy like that, he reminds me of a young goblin,” Baekmok whispered conspiratorially into Ara’s ear, as though sharing a secret. “Still, he really does have pressing matters to attend to…”</p>
<p>With that, Baekmok glanced at her watch, then slowly let go of Ara’s hand.</p>
<p>“For now, would you mind waiting over there?” Baekmok gestured toward the same spot Seok-kyung had pointed out earlier.</p>
<p>The area was near the expansive glass wall that offered a stunning view of the garden outside. Nestled beside a wooden bookshelf filled with neatly arranged books was a low tea table. The table was accompanied by an elegant leather sofa and adorned with a golden vase holding a bouquet of blooming flowers.</p>
<p>Resigned to their requests, Ara decided to wait as instructed.</p>
<p>She had barely settled into the plush sofa when a male goblin entered the room, pushing a tea tray. His immaculate navy suit and composed demeanor gave him the air of a butler.</p>
<p>With practiced precision, he placed a delicate teacup in front of Ara and poured the tea. As the warm liquid filled the cup, the pale lotus blossom nestled inside unfurled its petals layer by layer, creating an enchanting sight.</p>
<p>Ara sipped the sweet tea, savoring its rich flavor while taking in the view outside. The warmth of the tea seemed to dissolve the last traces of unease lingering in her heart, leaving her completely at ease.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Seok-kyung and Baekmok were deep in conversation, engrossed in their work. The stacks of documents emerging from the cabinet and the digital tablets being passed briskly between them made them look like a corporate executive and a secretary at a bustling multinational firm.</p>
<p><em>So, even goblin civilization is this advanced?</em> Ara mused, recalling Hongseon’s use of laptops and tablets during their last encounter. This world was far more sophisticated than she had initially imagined.</p>
<p><em>Well, if they can modify a goblin club to work as a smartphone hybrid…</em></p>
<p>Ara sipped her tea in small increments, her gaze shifting between the perfectly ordered scenery outside the glass and Seok-kyung, who was immersed in his work. Before she knew it, her attention lingered more on him than on the picturesque landscape.</p>
