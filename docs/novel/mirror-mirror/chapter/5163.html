            <p><strong>Chapter 15.2</strong></p>
<p>“Hey! Lee Cheong-seon!”</p>
<p>As soon as Ara left the kitchen, she dashed up to the third floor. She flung open every door, shouting at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>“You wicked goblin! Where are you? Come out!”</p>
<p>Her face, flushed with anger, quickly turned to embarrassment, and the incomplete shame swiftly morphed into rage. And that rage found its final destination: Cheong-seon.</p>
<p>Lee Cheong-seon. That trickster goblin. He tricked me again? After everything I did for him, even making him dongchimi noodles after that prank!</p>
<p>Bang, Ara flung open the next door with a huff.</p>
<p>The first thing that caught her eye in the spacious room was a head of bright red hair.</p>
<p>Hong-seon was sitting at a large desk. The screens of three different branded laptops and two tablets flashed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Does he have ten hands or something?</p>
<p>Catching her breath, Ara spoke.</p>
<p>“Hong-seon, sorry to bother you.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright.”</p>
<p>“Have you seen Lee Cheong-seon?”</p>
<p>“I have.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Hong-seon gestured with his chin behind him. At that moment, a head of bright blue hair popped up from behind Hong-seon’s chair.</p>
<p>Cheong-seon grinned mischievously, clearly enjoying the situation.</p>
<p>“Looking for me, Ara?”</p>
<p>Ara’s eyes narrowed as she glared at him, her anger bubbling up once more.</p>
<p>“You tricked me again, you traitor!”</p>
<p>“I’m busy, so go get beaten up outside.”</p>
<p>Hong-seon replied nonchalantly as he pulled the nearest laptop closer and began typing rapidly.</p>
<p>“How could you do this! Is our friendship worth so little? I didn’t think you’d sell me out to a human for nothing….”</p>
<p>Cheong-seon, looking as if he were the tragic hero in a melodrama, spoke with a shocked expression. He didn’t finish his sentence as he backed away, seeing Ara approach with a murderous glare.</p>
<p>“Hey. Come out while I’m still asking nicely.”</p>
<p>Ara no longer referred to him as “Cheong-seon-ssi.” Using a respectful honorific for this dim-witted goblin, whose mental age seemed lower than an elementary schooler’s, felt utterly undeserved.</p>
<p>“Ara, there seems to be some misunderstanding….”</p>
<p>“Misunderstanding? You lie every time you open your mouth. You knew it all along and did it on purpose. You said I wouldn’t be seen. You said I wouldn’t be heard!”</p>
<p>Ara threw the goblin cap she had been holding straight at Cheong-seon.</p>
<p>Cheong-seon barely managed to catch the flying sunglasses and looked at her with an aggrieved expression.</p>
<p>“No, humans really can’t see or hear you. I’m not lying. You saw me disappear yourself!”</p>
<p>“You should have told me it doesn’t work on goblins!”</p>
<p>“Well, you didn’t ask about that! How was I supposed to tell you something you didn’t ask about!”</p>
<p>“You didn’t need to be asked to spout off its features when you knew I would use it here!”</p>
<p>Ara’s fists trembled with rage.</p>
<p>Dear God, today I’m going to kill him and go to hell.</p>
<p>Reciting a famous drama line like a spell, Ara was about to grab Cheong-seon by the collar when—</p>
<p>“Lee Cheong-seon.”</p>
<p>Screeeech.</p>
<p>Hong-seon pushed his chair back and stood up. He positioned himself between Ara and Cheong-seon, turning to face the latter with his arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Should I call Namseol, or would you prefer to surrender to Miss Ara?”</p>
<p>“Is there no option where the beautiful and merciful Ara forgives my minor mistake?”</p>
<p>Instead of replying, Hong-seon glanced at Ara.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Ara quickly blocked any escape route for Cheong-seon.</p>
<p>“You heard her? Hand out.”</p>
<p>Hong-seon dug into his pocket and pulled out a silver ring-like object. Upon closer inspection, it resembled handcuffs used in the human world, but the ring was slightly thicker, and the chain connecting the cuffs was a bit longer. There was even a handle in the middle of the chain for someone to hold and pull.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>While Ara pondered, Cheong-seon dropped to his knees. He clung tightly to one of Hong-seon’s legs.</p>
<p>“Please, Hong-seon….”</p>
<p>“Disgusting. Get off.”</p>
<p>Hong-seon mercilessly stomped on Cheong-seon’s thigh with his shoe, causing Cheong-seon to yelp and release his leg.</p>
<p>Seizing the moment, Hong-seon snapped the silver ring onto Cheong-seon’s wrist. The moment it latched on, the ring emitted a soft, ethereal glow, a slightly bluish, cold light.</p>
<p>“Uhm, Hong-seon, what is that?”</p>
<p>Ara pointed at the peculiar cuffs and asked.</p>
<p>“Ah, these are called ‘Yeongsoe’ (Spirit Shackles). They are used to restrain goblins who have committed crimes and bring them to trial. Once worn, the goblin cannot use any of their supernatural abilities.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>Ara nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>Hong-seon yanked the handle in the middle of the chain. Cheong-seon, unable to resist the rough pull, stood up with a pained expression and was dragged along.</p>
<p>“Do you see this glow? This light embodies the power of the king. No goblin can defy the king’s will.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung had mentioned that Cheong-seon held a fairly high rank among goblins. However, even a high-ranking goblin seemed powerless before the king’s chains.</p>
<p>“Are you a goblin judge, Hong-seon?” Ara asked.</p>
