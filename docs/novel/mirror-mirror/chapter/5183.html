            <p><strong>Chapter 5.2</strong></p>
<p>Ara made a bombshell declaration.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s face was a picture of bewilderment, almost beyond disbelief.</p>
<p>Ara, ignoring his reaction, brazenly continued.</p>
<p>“I can’t leave here without ten billion. The loan sharks are probably hunting me down with eyes blazing.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“And you said you’d keep an eye on me, right? You need to be close to verify, how can you do that from afar?”</p>
<p>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</p>
<p>Repaying stubbornness with stubbornness was only fair.</p>
<p>Ara, feeling a bit triumphant, placed her hands on her hips. Her shoulders were squared like a victorious general’s.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’ll live here for the time being. If you don’t like it, Mr. Kim Seok-kyung, then hand over the ten billion right now. What’s it going to be?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung remained silent for a while. He seemed at a loss for words at Ara’s insistence and her push for a decision.</p>
<p>“If you don’t answer, I’ll take it as a yes.”</p>
<p>With that, Ara declared her intent and began picking up her belongings from the floor. She carefully gathered her deck of cards and blanket.</p>
<p>Leaving Seok-kyung standing there speechless, Ara made her way to the main hall, her legs trembling.</p>
<p>The old hanok was worn and chipped in many places. Yet, if examined closely, it was an incredibly luxurious mansion. It looked like a grand house from a noble family village, with exquisite details in the beams and tiles.</p>
<p>Ara brushed the thick layer of dust off the wooden floor with her hand. Though her claim about living there was a lie, the gesture stirred up a cloud of black dust in the air.</p>
<p>Still, it was better than the dirt floor.</p>
<p>Ara rolled up her eco bag to use as a pillow. She spread the blanket she had used for the card game over herself like a quilt. Considering she was on the verge of sleeping on the street, this was sheer luxury.</p>
<p>“Oof,” she groaned as she lay down, noticing a dark shadow looming over her head.</p>
<p>“You startled me. Can’t you make some noise when you walk?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung looked down at Ara, who was grumbling with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>“If you sleep on this cold floor, don’t come crying to me if you wake up with a twisted face.”</p>
<p>“I’m not asking for your concern.”</p>
<p>Ara snapped back as if she hadn’t expected any concern in the first place.</p>
<p>‘…But what if he actually cares?’</p>
<p>Her round eyes blinked slowly. Her lips, which had been moving sluggishly, parted slightly.</p>
<p>“If you’re so worried, why don’t you let me sleep inside?”</p>
<p>But Seok-kyung remained silent. Even if he was concerned, he didn’t like the idea.</p>
<p>‘Of course, I knew it from the way he always acted like he was doing me a favor.’</p>
<p>“I’m really going to sleep now.”</p>
<p>Ara decided to give up completely. She pulled the blanket up to her neck and curled up in a fetal position.</p>
<p>“Good night, Mr. Kim Seok-kyung.”</p>
<p>It had been an exhausting day, physically and mentally.</p>
<p>It would be nice if she could wake up and say it was just a strange dream…</p>
<p>Ara closed her eyes tightly. The fatigue of the day, combined with overwhelming drowsiness, washed over her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung sighed, rubbing his forehead. It had been a while since he had felt such a pounding headache in his temples.</p>
<p>The source of this excruciating headache was sound asleep on the main hall floor. Despite not having been lying down for long, Ara was already in a deep sleep, snoring softly.</p>
<p>“No wonder my dreams were so restless last night.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung muttered to himself as he plopped down next to the sleeping Ara.</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>Perhaps sensing his presence in her sleep, Ara groaned and shifted.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung glanced at her, then scooted over just a hand’s width away from where he had sat.</p>
<p>The world grew silent again. Surprisingly, no noise disturbed the night. Only Ara’s rhythmic breathing and the rustling of leaves in the wind broke the stillness of the old house.</p>
<p>Was it because the surroundings were too quiet?</p>
<p>‘Good night, Mr. Kim Seok-kyung.’</p>
<p>The brazen voice that shouldn’t have been audible now tickled his ears.</p>
<p>“Does she have no shame? What’s with ‘good night’?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung irritably rubbed his ears.</p>
<p>Maybe he should go and wash his ears. They say King Yeongjo of the Joseon Dynasty used to wash his ears whenever he heard something unpleasant.</p>
<p>Just as he was grumbling, recalling even the habits of King Yeongjo,</p>
<p>“Wham.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, right above where Seok-kyung sat, an upside-down face appeared under the eaves.</p>
<p>It was the face of a girl who looked like a high school student. Her long white hair, tied up in a bun, fluttered gently in the air.</p>
<p>Any normal human would have fainted at the sight, but Seok-kyung just leaned back indifferently. His long legs stretched out lazily.</p>
<p>“Nam Seol-do. Why are you up there instead of sleeping?”</p>
<p> </p>
