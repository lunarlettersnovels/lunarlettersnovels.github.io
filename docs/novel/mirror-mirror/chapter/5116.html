            <p><strong>Chapter 39.2</strong></p>
<p>Still puzzling over his words, Ara trotted after Baekmok, her footsteps trailing her out of the room. Her brown eyes darted back a few times, glancing at Seok-kyung, until the closing door finally swallowed him from view.</p>
<p><em>Click.</em></p>
<p>The sound of the door sealing the space was sharp, almost final.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung lowered the document he’d been holding high enough to hide his face, his gaze slipping back to the spot where Ara had been just moments ago.</p>
<p><em>“…if that’s what you want.”</em></p>
<p>Her stubbornly honest face lingered in his mind, unshakable and so ridiculously transparent it almost made him laugh.</p>
<p>“She really doesn’t have it in her to lie, does she…”</p>
<p>His voice was low, almost muttering to himself as if scolding her from afar.</p>
<p>But as he reached for the stack of papers again, a faint smile lingered on his lips, refusing to be hidden.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Fascinating.”</p>
<p>Baekmok broke the silence as they rounded a corner in the corridor, her tone light yet pointed.</p>
<p>“It’s been ages since I’ve seen His Highness look so… genuinely amused.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Kim Seok-kyung? He’s like that practically every day,” Ara replied with a tinge of exasperation. “He gets way too much joy out of teasing me. I swear, it’s his favorite pastime.”</p>
<p>Baekmok turned to her, eyes sparkling with amusement that she made no attempt to hide.</p>
<p>“Ara, do you know what the Wonhoe is?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly,” Ara admitted. “I just figured it’s some kind of important meeting.”</p>
<p>Baekmok nodded. “That’s right. It’s a gathering of the most powerful deities and spirits, hence the name <em>Wonhoe</em>. It happens rarely, maybe once a year at most, or as often as once a season. His Highness has <em>never</em> missed one. Perfect attendance.”</p>
<p>Wait. <em>Did he ditch that to come after me?</em></p>
<p>Ara’s thoughts barely had time to process before Baekmok confirmed it.</p>
<p>“And then, out of nowhere, he walked out in the middle of it. You can imagine how stunned everyone was.”</p>
<p>Ara recalled the image of Seok-kyung storming into her living room earlier that day, looking frantic and out of breath.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the timing, but it was how utterly uncharacteristic it was for him to look so rattled. He’d been worried. No question about it.</p>
<p>But she hadn’t realized just how monumental the thing he’d left behind was. She’d assumed it was like pushing some tasks to the next day.</p>
<p><em>Why didn’t he say anything…?</em></p>
<p>Her feelings wavered somewhere between guilt and a strange kind of warmth.</p>
<p>“The mighty Goblin King caused a scene over a mere human girl, huh?” Ara muttered with a sigh.</p>
<p>She had just started piecing together Seok-kyung’s earlier cryptic warning about rumors when Baekmok’s voice snapped her out of her thoughts.</p>
<p>“Mere?”</p>
<p>Baekmok stopped in her tracks, her brows lifting in mild disbelief.</p>
<p>Ara walked a few steps ahead before realizing Baekmok had stopped. Turning back, she saw the other woman gazing at her with something between amusement and reproach.</p>
<p>“We’re all born from objects steeped in human history,” Baekmok said, her tone firm but not unkind. “How could we ever dismiss you as something so insignificant?”</p>
<p>Her words carried enough weight that Ara found herself speechless for a moment.</p>
<p>“If His Highness truly thought of you as just another human girl, he’d <em>never</em> have done something so… adorable.”</p>
<p>And with that, Baekmok pointed to the emerald necklace glinting against Ara’s collarbone.</p>
<p>“This. Something as <em>adorable</em> as this.”</p>
<p>Ara blinked, momentarily caught off guard.</p>
<p>“This?” she echoed, touching the necklace reflexively. “What about it?”</p>
<p>Ara tilted her head, a faint crease forming between her brows.</p>
<p>“So, in the Goblin Kingdom, you call slapping a tracker on someone cute?”</p>
<p>“A tracker…”</p>
<p>Baekmok echoed the word slowly, as if rolling it around in her mouth to see if it made any sense. A small sigh slipped from her lips before she continued.</p>
<p>“It’s not <em>entirely</em> inaccurate, but that’s definitely not the right way to describe it.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“What’s imbued in that necklace is His Highness’s power—his <em>spirit energy.</em> In human terms, it’s like he’s given you a part of his life force.”</p>
<p>“Wait, <em>life force</em>?”</p>
<p>Ara’s eyes widened to twice their normal size, the shock visibly written all over her face.</p>
<p>“Yes. As long as you’re wearing it, no one can disrespect or harm you. Think of it as a kind of talisman.”</p>
<p>What? That wasn’t at all how Seok-kyung had explained it.</p>
<p>He’d said something vague about it being a precautionary measure, just a one-time safety charm.</p>
<p>Ara’s hand, hesitant and uncertain, hovered near her chest before finally closing around the gem. Cool to the touch, the emerald pulsed faintly with a soft, soothing light from within, as if radiating a calm yet powerful presence.</p>
<p>It did feel protective and almost alive.</p>
<p>“Well, to be fair, it <em>has</em> stirred up some gossip,” Baekmok said, smoothly changing the subject as she started walking again.</p>
<p>“Gossip?” Ara asked, instinctively falling in step behind her.</p>
<p>“Yes. The mighty, stubborn Goblin King finally enchanted, utterly captivated by his fated partner? It’s sparked quite a bit of speculation.”</p>
<p>Ara’s steps faltered, and her brows knitted together.</p>
<p>“<em>Enchanted by his fated partner</em>?”</p>
<p>The idea sounded so ludicrous that it took a moment for her to process it.</p>
<p>And even then, her only thought was:</p>
<p><em>That’s ridiculous.</em></p>
