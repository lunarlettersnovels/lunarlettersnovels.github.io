            <p><strong>Chapter 25.2</strong></p>
<p>“Thank you for the meal. You all enjoy the rest. I have a lot of dishes to clean up, so I’ll start tidying up now,” she interrupted, heading toward the sink, deliberately ignoring Seol-do’s persistent questioning.</p>
<p>The rush of water from the faucet was a welcome distraction, momentarily separating the kitchen from the dining area.</p>
<p>Ara tried to focus on the dishes, doing her best to avoid the prickling sensation at the back of her head. But just as she was washing a few plates, an unexpected hand snatched the sponge right out of her grasp.</p>
<p>“Naara, are you on a diet? Do you think the loan sharks won’t recognize you for that?”</p>
<p>The owner of the beautiful hands, even with prominent knuckles, was Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>“That’s not it.”</p>
<p>Ara almost instinctively protested, stepping back half a step from Seok-kyung, who had come too close.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung stared at her, who was suddenly on guard like a startled cat, then clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“I guess you forgot again, but during the contract period, meals and lodging are provided for free. I won’t charge you for eating a lot, so dig in.”</p>
<p>“I said that’s not it…”</p>
<p>How many times had she made this excuse today alone?</p>
<p>Ara accepted the bowl Seok-kyung handed her, washing it with a pout. The tingling at the back of her head felt even worse than before, but she tried to convince herself it was just in her head, as if she could brainwash herself a million times over.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t just her imagination. The group at the table was now openly staring at Ara, observing her.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung glanced between them and Ara before moving closer again, closing the distance she had just created.</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>His noticeably lowered voice spread like a whisper.</p>
<p>“Who’s bothering you? Who is it?”</p>
<p>When she instinctively turned around, deep, intense eyes met hers. Eyes that seemed capable of changing anything, filled with a hint of genuine concern.</p>
<p>Ara bit her lip tightly. Suddenly, Seol-do’s voice echoed in her mind like a hallucination.</p>
<p>‘You like him, right? Our king.’</p>
<p>Like him? Me? This man, no, this goblin?</p>
<p>That couldn’t be true.</p>
<p>Of course, Seok-kyung was the most beautiful person she had ever seen. But simple fondness and romantic feelings were completely different. No matter how little experience she had with real relationships, she wasn’t foolish enough to confuse the two.</p>
<p>‘So you fell for him?’</p>
<p>It was just that he was a bit, just a bit too handsome, and meeting his gaze up close made her heart drop.</p>
<p>She was only staying here to please him because she couldn’t get a billion won without his goblin’s club.</p>
<p>That was obvious, right? Who would like a bad goblin who messes around and purposely says mean things…?</p>
<p>“Who do you think it is?”</p>
<p>Ara replied in a strangely sulky voice.</p>
<p>This was likely just a setup to tease her, so why was he making such a kind face? It was confusing.</p>
<p>“Of course, it’s Kim Seok-kyung.”</p>
<p>“Was it an unexpected answer?” Seok-kyung’s perfectly arched eyebrows tilted in discontent. His slightly narrowed eyes didn’t shy away from Ara’s gaze; if anything, they scrutinized her expressions with persistent intensity.</p>
<p>Ara hurriedly placed the washed bowl on the drying rack and wiped her wet hands.</p>
<p>There was still plenty of washing up to do, but Seok-kyung’s piercing stare felt unbearable. She wanted to escape before he could cast any strange spells on her.</p>
<p>No, something strange had to be happening already. How could even his frown look so handsome?</p>
<p>“People with OCD—no, even goblins—clean up after themselves.”</p>
<p>She tossed her apron aside in a rush, carelessly flinging it into the corner. Even knowing it was an impulsive move, her body acted faster than her mind.</p>
<p>Ara practically sprinted out of the dining room.</p>
<p>“Hey, Na Ara! Where are you going?”</p>
<p>She pretended not to hear Seol-do’s call.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung, missing his chance to object, stared blankly at the spot where Ara had just been.</p>
<p>It was truly baffling. He had meant to be helpful, but now he had unwittingly become the source of Ara’s distress.</p>
<p>Yet, Seok-kyung didn’t chase after her to protest. He didn’t offer any explanations to the other goblins, who were watching him with curious expressions.</p>
<p>Instead, he quietly stared at the suddenly empty seat beside him.</p>
<p>‘Who do you think it is? Of course, it’s Kim Seok-kyung.’</p>
<p>The image of Ara’s small, sad face, like a puppy abandoned in the rain, lingered in his mind.</p>
<p>‘That’s not it…’</p>
<p>Her voice, slightly trembling as if she were pouting, echoed in his ears.</p>
<p>“When did I ever make her suffer like that…?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung let out a long sigh without realizing it. His hands, momentarily frozen as if lost, eventually resumed wiping the piled dishes.</p>
<p>The empty space felt oddly hollow. He muttered to himself about how that ungrateful person must have added something to dinner, grumbling away.</p>
