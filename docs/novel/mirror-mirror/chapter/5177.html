        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 8.2</strong></p>
<p>Ara resumed her cheerful demeanor, a sunny smile lighting up her face. It was the kind of positive outlook that she had honed from a less-than-ideal upbringing. People are naturally drawn to the light, especially when surrounded by darkness.</p>
<p>At that moment, the clamor of footsteps and lively chatter approached from the entrance.</p>
<p>“Oh, right,” Ara said, quickly wiping her hands on her apron.</p>
<p>“Where’s the dog food? I need to make sure Baekseol—no, Baekseol-nim—gets fed too. But I didn’t see any in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung couldn’t help but stifle a laugh at Ara’s earnest question.</p>
<p>He was indeed a handsome man, and his rare smiles were truly something to behold. It was almost a shame he didn’t smile more often.</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing?” Ara asked, puzzled by his reaction.</p>
<p>Ara was once again momentarily distracted by Seok-kyung’s striking appearance, which made her protest a beat too late.</p>
<p>“Well, our Baekseol is quite the princess with a long memory.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“If he gets upset, it’ll last for a week. And if he finds out we ate without him? I’d say this week might be a bit rough.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung shrugged with a chuckle. Ara, recalling the previous scene, shuddered at the memory of Baekseol’s fierce anger.</p>
<p>“Hey! Nam Seol-do!” Baekseol had bellowed, his voice echoing through the house as he pounced on Seol-do, fists flying. His rage was as intense as a hunting dog chasing a wild boar. Surely, such fury wouldn’t be easily forgotten?</p>
<p>“So tell me quickly! Where’s the dog food?”</p>
<p>As Ara stomped her feet in frustration, Baekseol and Seol-do’s presence drew closer.</p>
<p>“There isn’t any. No dog food.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung now watched Ara with the amused detachment of someone enjoying a comedic performance, arms crossed.</p>
<p>It was clear that he wasn’t going to make things easy. It was foolish of Ara to expect any help.</p>
<p>With no other choice, Ara resumed her search through the kitchen. She had barely reopened a drawer she had already checked when Seol-do and Baekseol burst into the dining area.</p>
<p>“Food! It smells delicious!”</p>
<p>Baekseol bounded into the room, tail wagging like a propeller. Her pink nose twitched as he sniffed the air eagerly.</p>
<p>“I’ll eat well.”</p>
<p>Seol-do plopped down next to Seok-kyung’s seat and greeted Ara with a casual nod. Her usual indifferent expression remained, but her eyes sparkled as they surveyed the table.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung, unable to withstand Seol-do’s unspoken demand to start eating, picked up his chopsticks. He hastily grabbed a nearby dish, prompting Seol-do to begin his meal in earnest.</p>
<p>“I’ll eat well too!” Baekseol exclaimed, settling down at her spot.</p>
<p>Baekseol leaped onto the chair opposite Seok-kyung, which was where Ara had been sitting earlier, and immediately aimed for a bowl of rice. His long snout was stopped short by a pair of chopsticks.</p>
<p>“Baekseol, that’s not your food.” The chopsticks belonged to Ara.</p>
<p>“Can’t you see? There are spoons and chopsticks laid out. That’s for him.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung pointed to the pair of utensils next to the bowl of rice. As he said, Ara had set out a spoon and chopsticks for herself.</p>
<p>Baekseol froze, looking as if struck by lightning. Her disbelief turned slowly towards Ara.</p>
<p>“What about my food?”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. I couldn’t find the dog food, no matter how much I searched the kitchen. If you can tell me where it is…”</p>
<p>“Dog food?”</p>
<p>Baekseol interrupted Ara sharply. Her ears perked up, and her slightly parted lips revealed sharp teeth.</p>
<p>“Are you telling me to eat dog food?”</p>
<p>“Uh, well, then what…”</p>
<p>“Food! Of course, I eat human food! Do you think I’m some common stray lying around on the streets? Haven’t you heard my introduction earlier? I’m a guardian spirit! I live longer than you and am a great spirit managing the Maze Garden!”</p>
<p>Baekseol glared at Ara as if ready to pounce. A growling sound, similar to an angry fighting dog, rumbled from her.</p>
<p>Ara remembered Seok-kyung’s voice. ‘There’s no dog food.’ Understanding Seok-kyung’s words for the first time, Ara felt an intense wave of frustration.</p>
<p>‘Why didn’t he just say so earlier! Ara silently cursed Seok-kyung, who was watching the scene with interest. Then, she quickly grabbed Baekseol’s fluffy front paws.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Baekseol. It’s my first time here, so I didn’t know. I’ll make sure to prepare food for you from now on. More of it, packed tight.”</p>
<p>Ara’s small hands clutched Baekseol’s tiny front paws with earnest sincerity. “Can you please just let it go this once?”</p>
<p>Baekseol, taken aback by Ara’s sudden plea and submissive posture, slowly retracted her sharp teeth, revealing a more puzzled look.</p>
<p>“Cute and lovable Baekseol will forgive you this once.”</p>
<p>Baekseol blinked her gem-like eyes and wagged his tail slightly, almost as if asking for more. “Hmph. I’ll let it slide this time. But if it happens again, I won’t be so lenient.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Baekseol.” Ara couldn’t believe she was groveling to a talking dog. If someone had told her yesterday she’d be begging for a dog’s forgiveness, she’d have laughed in their face.</p>
<p>What had her life become?</p>
