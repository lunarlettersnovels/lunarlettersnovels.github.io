            <p><strong>Chapter 19.2</strong></p>
<p>“Just look at him—handsome face, tall and sturdy build, obviously competent and accomplished. You won’t believe how thorough he is when he comes here to shop. Polite, doesn’t waste money. And the way he picks out his groceries—he must be good in the kitchen too, right?”</p>
<p>The shop owner didn’t bother waiting for Ara’s response. Her mistaken assumptions had already blossomed into a full-fledged tree, branches reaching out, leaves sprouting.</p>
<p>“Ah, I was wondering why I hadn’t seen him for a while. Turns out he was busy enjoying his honeymoon with such a lovely young lady?”</p>
<p>“Haha…”</p>
<p>“I tell you, this is the best time. Just meeting eyes across the table is enough to bring joy.”</p>
<p>Joy.</p>
<p>Maybe Seok-kyung found it amusing. He certainly seemed to enjoy teasing her.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung strode over, placing the chosen vegetables on the counter. “You’ve got it all right.”</p>
<p>With a meaningful glance, he looked down at Ara, who was still processing the unexpected words.</p>
<p>“It’s been really fun lately. With her.”</p>
<p>Ara’s brow furrowed as she looked up at him in disbelief.</p>
<p>What is this goblin saying now?</p>
<p>Unable to voice her outrage, Ara jabbed him lightly in the side with her elbow.</p>
<p>But Seok-kyung didn’t flinch. Instead, he looked down at her with an even more amused expression.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re just head over heels, aren’t you? It’s hard to live alone after losing a spouse.”</p>
<p>The shop owner, unaware of the truth, chuckled as she lamented her situation.</p>
<p>“In any case, you two make a lovely couple. The young lady is so pretty and charming, it’s no wonder the young man can’t live without her. No, I should say he’s no longer a young man now that he’s got a wife.”</p>
<p>As the elderly woman packed the vegetables into a large plastic bag, she glanced up at Seok-kyung, meeting his eyes.</p>
<p>“So, what should I call you? What’s our handsome groom’s last name?”</p>
<p>“It’s Kim.”</p>
<p>“Well then, I’ll start calling you Mr. Kim now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please do.”</p>
<p>Yes, please do? Ara was completely flabbergasted.</p>
<p>This is the same guy who scoffed at the idea of being called Mr. Kim in this day and age, and now he’s just going along with it?</p>
<p>Wasn’t this the same person who threw a fit about not standing in the way of someone’s marriage prospects? And now he’s suddenly playing the role of a newlywed husband? What about my marriage prospects?</p>
<p>This goblin has some nerve.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. I’ve got some special sesame oil I’ve been saving. It’s perfect for dipping in when you eat cold dishes. I’ll give you a bottle as a gift for bringing your lovely bride.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, that’s really not necessary.”</p>
<p>“What? You don’t eat sesame oil? Should I give you perilla oil instead? Don’t worry, it’s all locally sourced. We press it right in the mill out back. No imported stuff here.”</p>
<p>“That’s not it…” Kim Seok-kyung was hesitant.</p>
<p>“Then what’s the issue? This stuff is truly precious. I only give it to special people. That old man who sells shoes around the corner has begged me for some, but I’ve kept it hidden just for occasions like this.”</p>
<p>“Since it’s so valuable, you should keep it for your children.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying? I’ve already given them their share. This is just the little bit I kept for myself.”</p>
<p>“I see. Well, I haven’t paid yet. How much do I owe you?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung awkwardly smiled as he discreetly took hold of the bag of vegetables that had just been packed. Ara glanced up at him suspiciously. His side profile, an undeniably handsome face, seemed to be more troubled than the situation warranted.</p>
<p>Something was definitely off.</p>
<p>Sure, the shop owner’s kindness was a bit much and persistent, but it was just some sesame oil—hardly anything worth making a fuss over. It was a simple, warm gesture of rural hospitality, nothing extraordinary. It was a small extra gift for a regular customer, that’s all it was.</p>
<p>So why was he refusing so insistently? Wouldn’t it be easier to accept and be done with it?</p>
<p>As Ara watched Seok-kyung, who seemed oddly flustered, an idea suddenly dawned on her—one that could relieve her pent-up frustration from all his teasing. Besides, she would hate for Kim Seok-kyung to break the old woman’s generous heart.</p>
<p>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</p>
<p>If someone teases you for no reason, why not give them a reason?</p>
<p>“Oh, honey,” Ara cooed as she dropped the strap of her tote bag and instead grabbed Seok-kyung’s arm, hugging it tightly as she leaned into him.</p>
<p>She felt his already firm body instantly tense up like a rock beneath her touch.</p>
<p>“Are you out of your mind?” Seok-kyung whispered, clearly startled, and tried to pull his arm away, but Ara only tightened her grip.</p>
<p>“Sweetheart, the kind lady offers it with such a generous heart. It wouldn’t be polite to keep refusing, would it? Don’t you agree, grandma?”</p>
