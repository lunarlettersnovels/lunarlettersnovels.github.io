            <p><strong>Chapter 33.2</strong></p>
<p>Was it really going to be this simple? She’d half expected him to drag it out or scold her further.</p>
<p>“You’re not… You’re not usually this kind of kind-hearted goblin…”</p>
<p>Her words trailed off as she realized, too late, that her thoughts had slipped out loud. Ara clamped her mouth shut, mortified.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung clicked his tongue and tugged the pot from her grasp, effortlessly wresting it away.</p>
<p>“Your brain doesn’t seem to be keeping up with your body.”</p>
<p>Step, step. His familiar reprimand was punctuated by the sound of his measured footsteps as he rounded the counter.</p>
<p>A long shadow stretched across the floor, reaching her.</p>
<p>“Just go sit over there and stay out of the way.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s gaze flicked toward the dining table in the corner.</p>
<p>Ara glanced back and forth between the dining table Seok-kyung had pointed to and the goblin himself. Then, with remarkable speed, she shook off the lingering unease and disappointment.</p>
<p><em>Fine. What did it matter? Maybe this goblin had decided to try on a “kind-hearted” act for a change.</em></p>
<p>The ability to read a situation and adapt swiftly to it was one of the few gifts her unordinary life had left her.</p>
<p>Ara grabbed the vegetables she had set aside earlier and held them up with a playful shake.</p>
<p>“I’ll stay out of your way. Just prep the ingredients, that’s all. Surely that’s okay?”</p>
<p>“You were just saying how much pain you’re in—‘a lot more than it looks,’ wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung mimicked her words with narrowed eyes, his tone dripping with sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Wow, Hongseon’s healing skills must be miraculous. I’m improving by the second. See? Pretty much good as new.”</p>
<p>She lifted her wrist toward his face and twirled it in mock demonstration. Her dark, sparkling eyes peeked up at him with a smile teetering on the edge of impishness.</p>
<p>“…First, it’s this. Then it’s that. How am I supposed to keep up with you?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung muttered the words like a sigh and turned away.</p>
<p>He avoided a direct response, but Ara knew by now that his silence was its own kind of agreement.</p>
<p>He moved to stand in front of the sink, likely to use the water. His strong hands unbuckled his watch, and with a smooth gesture, he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. The clink of metal and the rustle of fabric soon blended with the rush of running water, muffling the sounds.</p>
<p>Ara’s gaze lingered momentarily on his half-exposed forearms, her thoughts meandering before snapping back into place when Seok-kyung turned his head. She quickly busied herself by throwing on an apron.</p>
<p>“For tonight’s dinner, I was thinking galbi-jjim for the main dish, bean sprout soup for the side, and zucchini pancakes. How does that sound?”</p>
<p>“Do what you want.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung answered flatly, wiping down the pot.</p>
<p>“Do what you want,” she thought. On any other day, that dismissive response would’ve annoyed her to no end, sparking a string of protests.</p>
<p>But not today. Today, her priority was keeping his attention elsewhere. Peeking at him cautiously, she began prepping the ingredients alongside him.</p>
<p>The two stood side by side in the kitchen, silently absorbed in their tasks. For all the lack of conversation, they worked together surprisingly well.</p>
<p>Yet every now and then, when Ara stole a glance at Seok-kyung, their eyes would unexpectedly meet. Her heart stuttered like a thief caught red-handed, and she’d hastily avert her gaze, feeling oddly flustered.</p>
<p>Bubbling stew and the clinking of dishes filled the awkward silence that had stretched between them for a while.</p>
<p>“Don’t go anywhere alone for the time being.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung finally broke the quiet.</p>
<p>“If you can, don’t leave the house. And if you have to, take Baekseol with you.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Why do you think? You’ve got a ghost following you.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Ara froze mid-motion, the dried persimmon she’d been plucking the stem from forgotten between her fingers.</p>
<p>A ghost? Following her?</p>
<p>That couldn’t be true. Neither Hongseon nor Baekseol had mentioned anything like that…</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me no one’s warned you?”</p>
<p>“W-warned me about what?”</p>
<p>“It’s here now. Right behind you.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s sharp gaze locked onto a point just past Ara’s shoulder. His deep, dark eyes were unnervingly serious, betraying no hint of humor.</p>
<p>“W-where? Where is it? Hurry up and get rid of it!”</p>
<p>Panicking, Ara leapt from her seat. She swatted frantically at her shoulders and back, practically scrambling toward Seok-kyung in a desperate bid for safety. Her pale face twisted into a near-cry, as if the ghost had already claimed her soul.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung let out a sudden, involuntary chuckle.</p>
<p>He tried to stifle it, biting down hard on his lower lip, but muffled snickers kept spilling out.</p>
<p>Ara, locked in an invisible battle with her supposed spectral foe, froze at the sound of his laughter.</p>
<p>And then, the realization hit her a beat too late.</p>
<p>That terrible goblin had played her for a fool yet again!</p>
<p>“What the heck! You were lying, weren’t you? That’s so mean!”</p>
<p>Smack!</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Ara’s hand landed sharply on Seok-kyung’s arm.</p>
