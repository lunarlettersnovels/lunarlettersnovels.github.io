            <p><strong>Chapter 23.1</strong></p>
<p>Ara, hit right on target, furrowed her brow to hide her embarrassment. She felt cold sweat forming on her hands, which were now resting on her hips as she tried to look even slightly confident.</p>
<p><em>Darn it, those loan sharks. Why did they have to run their mouths like that…</em></p>
<p>“I was really popular, you know? Those guys got it wrong! What they said was complete nonsense.”</p>
<p>“Did someone say something?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung chuckled again, shrugging his shoulders. His face made it clear that he didn’t believe a single word she said.</p>
<p>“And, even if—just hypothetically—it was true, which it absolutely is not, how can you be so sure that I wouldn’t do something like that? Do you really think you know me that well? You said yourself that you don’t know me.”</p>
<p>Ara poured out her words in a heated rush and instantly regretted it. Getting worked up like this was probably making her look more suspicious, but her mouth was running wild on its own.</p>
<p>“I think I mentioned this before. You’re really bad at lying, Na Ara.”</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung clicked his tongue and sidestepped her to continue walking.</p>
<p>“You’re so annoying. Do you think you can get away with everything just because you’re handsome?”</p>
<p>Panting from frustration, her breaths came in disorganized bursts—until they abruptly stopped, her steps halting like she’d slammed on the brakes.</p>
<p>“Yes. I do.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung had turned around suddenly, his face filling Ara’s field of vision.</p>
<p>Frozen like she’d been hit with an ice spell, Ara just blinked her wide eyes in silence.</p>
<p>Up close, his face was like a sculpture. His smooth forehead, high-bridged nose, and perfectly shaped lips—all came together in harmony as if Leonardo da Vinci himself had measured their golden ratio.</p>
<p>But what stood out most were his eyes.</p>
<p>Like sunlight shimmering on the deep sea with golden ripples, a faint golden hue encircled the sharp black of his irises. It was such a subtle contrast that anyone standing farther away might not even notice it.</p>
<p>His long eyelashes cast bold shadows over his pupils, and the gaze from those dark depths felt like an irresistible charm—one no mere human could defy.</p>
<p>No, perhaps it wasn’t just simple allure.</p>
<p>It felt stranger than that, something a bit more tender and nostalgic…</p>
<p>“Are you seriously saying you don’t remember what you just said?” Seok-kyung’s low murmur broke the moment. His beautiful eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
<p>With a gasp, Ara exhaled the breath she had been holding in as long as she could.</p>
<p>“You scared me!”</p>
<p>She pushed against his chest and took a step back. Even through the layers of clothing, she could feel the hard ridge of his collarbone under her palms.</p>
<p><em>My heart nearly jumped out of my chest.</em></p>
<p><em>No matter how non-human he is, how is it even possible to look this good? What is he, Medusa? One glance from him and I’m completely paralyzed!</em></p>
<p>While Ara grumbled inwardly, Seok-kyung clicked his tongue once more and turned around again. The plastic bags in his hands swung in rhythm with his steps.</p>
<p>Ara followed behind, her hand still resting over her pounding heart. Her gaze, which had been focused on the tips of her worn sneakers, slowly lifted to glare at the back of Seok-kyung’s head.</p>
<p>“Kim Seok-kyung, you’re a player, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Her out-of-nowhere question made Seok-kyung glance back at her.</p>
<p>“Of course. Isn’t it rude to pry into someone’s private life?”</p>
<p>Ara’s jaw dropped. He’s not even denying it!</p>
<p>Not only that, bringing up privacy was absurd. It was so ridiculous, it left her speechless.</p>
<p>“What about my privacy? You heard everything!”</p>
<p>In her flustered state, Ara accidentally admitted to the loan sharks’ words being true. She realized her mistake a beat too late, and by then, Seok-kyung’s mouth had already twisted into that insufferable smirk.</p>
<p>“Did I ask? It was those guys who talked, and you just spilled the rest.”</p>
<p>To make matters worse, his response hit her like a fact-driven punch.</p>
<p>Forget those loan sharks—this goblin is the real thug. There should be a law against assaulting someone with facts.</p>
<p>Ara quickened her pace with a frown.</p>
<p>Her gaze, which had been locked onto the back of Seok-kyung’s neck, soon found itself next to him. His steps had slowed, even if only by a fraction, allowing her to catch up.</p>
<p>Ara pressed on, her voice unwavering despite the odd glances Seok-kyung was giving her.</p>
<p>“Come on, be honest. You change girlfriends all the time, don’t you? Yesterday’s girl is gone by today, and you don’t stop anyone from coming or going. Am I right?”</p>
<p>“Do I look like I have that much free time?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Ara’s response was firm and immediate.</p>
<p>This time, Seok-kyung’s face showed genuine disbelief. “So, that’s why I haven’t gotten married yet, huh? Because I haven’t found true love to dedicate my life to?”</p>
<p>“It’s because you’re too busy.” Ara gave up. She deliberately dragged out her reply, adding a side-eye that said, Yeah, sure, whatever you say.</p>
<p>“Right. Why don’t you believe me? Didn’t you learn about a king’s schedule when you were in school? Kings lead way more complicated and busy lives than commoners.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t have to study with ministers or deal with morning and evening greetings like a human king, do you?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got different responsibilities than human kings. Stuff that keeps me busy while you, Na Ara, are snoring away.”</p>
<p>“I don’t snore!”</p>
<p>Ara, maintaining her cool until that point, couldn’t help but snap at that jab.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung, catching her flustered state, threw out another sly remark.</p>
<p>“How would you know? You can’t even remember what you did last night.”</p>
<p><em>Last night?</em></p>
<p><em>Wait a minute. What did I do last night?</em></p>
