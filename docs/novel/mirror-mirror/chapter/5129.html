            <p><strong>Chapter 32.2</strong></p>
<p>Back then, Seok-kyung was a powerful but volatile force. He had a knack for controlling things, ruling as effortlessly as breathing. But he struggled with attachment, with bringing anything close to his heart. Outwardly, he could charm and get along with anyone, but deep down, he kept his true self sealed away, showing no one his deepest sincerity.</p>
<p>Ungeom had worried about this shadow in Seok-kyung’s heart. To live forever and alone, he thought, was a curse worse than any mortal punishment.</p>
<p><em>“Exactly,”</em> Seok-kyung had replied. <em>“Then I must seal it even tighter. Still waters do not stir. That’s the peace you speak of, isn’t it?”</em></p>
<p>He rejected Ungeom’s concern, neither understanding his counsel nor feeling the need to. A throne was always a solitary place. Vulnerability was a weakness, and truth, after all, wasn’t always beneficial.</p>
<p>So Seok-kyung lived as he wished: regally, immaculately, and by cutting away the roots of any feeling that dared to unsettle him.</p>
<p><em>“Face the small waves within you,”</em> Ungeom had warned. <em>“If you don’t, one day they will grow into a great tide that will swallow you whole.”</em></p>
<p>Even now, as he recalled the old advice from Ungeom, Seok-kyung didn’t think he was wrong.</p>
<p>But… he was curious.</p>
<p><em>“Even if you might manage to deceive yourself, there’ll come a time when nothing can be concealed anymore.”</em></p>
<p>Why did Seol-do say such things? What did it seem like he was hiding?</p>
<p><em>“If you were worried, just say you were.”</em></p>
<p>The moment Seok-kyung checked Cheong-seon’s message, and faced that foolish face stained with tears, the rising irritation seemed to only define the feeling as worry, but could it really be that simple?</p>
<p>Seok-kyung clenched and released his empty fist repeatedly. His deep gaze fixed on the empty ceiling for a long while before his eyes slowly shut, shutting out the world around him.</p>
<p>And then, oddly enough, it felt like he was hearing something far away—the sound of waves crashing.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Haaam…”</p>
<p>Ara yawned and stretched. After a long nap, it was already evening.</p>
<p>“Really, habits are scary. How is it that I wake up at the exact time to cook, even when I’m in the middle of sleeping?”</p>
<p>At this rate, she couldn’t argue against the teasing that she was a housekeeper.</p>
<p>Ara clicked her tongue and rotated her wrists and ankles in a circle. Her joints, once marked with dark stains, had returned to their usual pale skin and moved smoothly.</p>
<p>“It’s all done. Everything’s been completely healed, so there should be no aftereffects or issues with bodily functions.”</p>
<p>Hong-seon’s treatment had worked wonders. It had hurt so much during the process that Ara had cried, but now, it felt like she had never been injured at all. In fact, she felt lighter than usual.</p>
<p>Since Hong-seon’s expertise had roots in ancient teachings, perhaps they were knowledgeable about texts like the <em>Donguibogam</em>. She’d have to ask later if they were good with acupuncture.</p>
<p>With those selfish thoughts in mind, Ara got up and left the room.</p>
<p>The living room, bathed in the soft glow of sunset, was quiet. Perhaps they had gone for an evening walk? Seol-do and Baekseol, who were always sprawled on the couch, were nowhere to be seen. Cheong-seon and Hong-seon must have also left, as there was no sound from upstairs either.</p>
<p>And one more thing—the invisible goblin…</p>
<p>“Wherever he is, I don’t care.”</p>
<p>Though she had let go of her frustration after crying while hugging Baekseol, thinking of Seok-kyung still stirred up some lingering bitterness.</p>
<p>Since no one was around to see, Ara snorted and stomped her feet. Her noisy steps led her to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Though she was upset, eating was another matter entirely.</p>
<p>“Let’s see, what should I make for dinner?”</p>
<p>After all, she had promised to take charge of the meals while staying in the house, and she didn’t want to break that promise. Besides, after causing such a scene, Ara was starting to feel hungry.</p>
<p>“Meat is the best when you’re feeling low on energy. I had marinated some yesterday…”</p>
<p>Ara took the marinated ribs and vegetables out of the fridge. She planned to make braised ribs. She opened the cupboard full of large pots and pans and struggled to pull out the pressure cooker that was hidden deep inside.</p>
<p>“You put it so deep thinking your arms are long… Ah, got it.”</p>
<p>Finally, her fingers grasped the handle. She pulled out the pot with all her strength and stood up, about to turn around, when—</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Ara screamed and stumbled backward.</p>
