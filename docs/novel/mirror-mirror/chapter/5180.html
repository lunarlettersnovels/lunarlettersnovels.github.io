            <p><strong>Chapter 7.1</strong></p>
<p>“What nonsense are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Baekseol stretched out a paw and pointed somewhere in disbelief.</p>
<p>“It says so on your identification card.”</p>
<p>In the middle of the floor lay her eco bag, thoroughly rummaged through. Besides the scattered clothes, flashlight, water bottle, and charger, her teal wallet lay wide open.</p>
<p>Wait a second.</p>
<p>I clearly remember sleeping on the blanket-covered wooden veranda last night. What is this pristine, modern room?</p>
<p>Ara frowned, trying to recall her memories.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, the blanket covering her wasn’t the herringbone-patterned one. The pillow she was using and the bed she was lying on were the kind you’d only see in the luxury bedding section of a department store.</p>
<p>But Ara had no memory of entering such a room. Even if she had a sleepwalking disorder she wasn’t aware of, it would have been impossible.</p>
<p>The goblin’s house was a dilapidated, abandoned house in the middle of the mountains. Not a single modern building was nearby, let alone a shabby thatched house.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to rummage through your stuff from the start. But you just wouldn’t wake up! I can’t stand being hungry!”</p>
<p>Baekseol belatedly made a half-hearted excuse, perhaps misunderstanding Ara’s wrinkled expression and silence.</p>
<p>Ignoring Baekseol, Ara sprang up from her spot and strode across the room, which seemed at least twice the size of her original one-room apartment.</p>
<p>“Hey, where are you going? Are you mad? Ara!”</p>
<p>Baekseol hurriedly jumped off the bed and chased after Ara.</p>
<p>Ara didn’t care about Baekseol tugging at her pants leg. She flung the door open without hesitation.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>What unfolded before Ara’s eyes was an elegant, spacious living room. The kind you’d see in movies and dramas, where protagonists born into wealthy families live.</p>
<p>A sparkling crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, and a sofa that could easily seat ten people was placed alongside a massage chair you’d only see in commercials. The wall-mounted TV, nearly filling the art wall, looked over a hundred inches.</p>
<p>“Why are you so surprised? It’s not like it’s your first time seeing a goblin.”</p>
<p>And right in the middle of this scene, reclining on a couch was Nam Seol-do acknowledging her presence.</p>
<p>Dressed in a neon yellow tracksuit, her snow-white hair twisted into a bun on top of her head, Seol-do looked like any other teenage girl.</p>
<p>The only unusual thing was the ornate mother-of-pearl hairpin, something you’d expect to see in a museum, piercing through her voluminous, round hair.</p>
<p>“Who… who are you?”</p>
<p>“She’s Seol-do. Nam Seol-do. She’s the bodyguard Seok-kyung oppa keeps around,” Baekseol chimed in, introducing Seol-do while hopping onto the table.</p>
<p>Seol-do switched the TV channel, using her foot, which was propped up on the table, to nudge Baekseol off.</p>
<p>“Stop calling him oppa. Isn’t it gross? How can a goblin have a brother?” She teased the talking dog.</p>
<p>“Dog? I’m a puppy! Where else can you find a cute and lovable puppy like me?” Baekseol looked indignant.</p>
<p>“Dog, puppy, same thing.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not! Calling me a dog makes me sound less cute!”</p>
<p>“Get a grip. When was the last time you looked in a mirror? You’re not a puppy anymore.”</p>
<p>“Hey! Nam Seol-do!” Baekseol growled, baring teeth like a fighting dog.</p>
<p>“Umm. Excuse me. Can I say something too?” Ara, who had been quietly watching the chaotic scene, carefully spoke up.</p>
<p>Baekseol and Seol-do, who had been glaring at each other, finally turned their eyes toward Ara.</p>
<p>“First of all… where are we?”</p>
<p>“Where else? It’s the goblin’s house,” Seol-do answered nonchalantly. Ara shook her head in disbelief.</p>
<p>“That can’t be right. I definitely fell asleep on the goblin house’s veranda last night. But when I woke up, I was in that room over there…”</p>
<p>“This is Seok-kyung oppa’s house. Last night, Seol-do carried you in and laid you in that room while you were asleep,” Baekseol said, pointing a plump paw towards the room Ara had just stormed out of.</p>
<p>“Oh, really? I didn’t know. Thanks for that. But why did you…”</p>
<p>“Our king has a soft spot, despite how he seems.”</p>
<p>“Our king?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. The goblin king. Kim Seok-kyung, the one who lost to you in the bet last night.”</p>
<p>Goblin king? Not just any goblin, but a king?</p>
<p>Ara was momentarily surprised but quickly accepted it.</p>
<p>That explains it. I knew he was unusually unlucky. Of course, he has to be some sort of tyrant…</p>
<p>But why let me in here? He acted like he wouldn’t let me in, no matter what, last night.</p>
<p>Did something happen while I was asleep? I want to ask, but where did he go so early in the morning that he hasn’t shown up at all? Is he really that busy?</p>
<p>While Ara was lost in her thoughts, Baekseol hopped off the table and approached her with small, quick steps.</p>
<p>“The different house setup is because you’ve entered the real goblin house now. What you saw yesterday was a fake goblin house created by the Maze Garden.”</p>
<p>“By the way, the Maze Garden is managed by yours truly,” Baekseol added this with a note of pride, puffing out her chest as if expecting praise.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s amazing…”</p>
<p><em>How adorable.</em></p>
<p>Ara suppressed her twitching smile and bent down to pat Baekseol on the top of her head.</p>
<p>“But Baekseol-nim, what’s the Maze Garden for?”</p>
<p>“Maze Garden? You don’t know? Ha, can’t be helped. This clever Baekseol-nim will personally explain—”</p>
<p>“Hey. Ara.”</p>
<p>Seol-do cut off Baekseol’s detailed explanation and self-praise. With ears pinned forward in annoyance, Baekseol bared her teeth again.</p>
