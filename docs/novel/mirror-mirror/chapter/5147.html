            <p><strong>Chapter 23.2</strong></p>
<p>Ara’s brain went into overdrive, desperately trying to recall the events of the previous night. But instead of drunken memories, what resurfaced was a conversation she had earlier that morning.</p>
<p>‘So… did I mess up last night?’</p>
<p>‘Mess up? No, the king made a mistake. You should’ve seen his face when it happened.’</p>
<p>Ara had been too confused to understand what Seol-do meant at the time. Now, Seok-kyung’s words from a few moments ago were hitting her square in the chest.</p>
<p>‘Are you saying you really don’t remember what you said?’</p>
<p><em>Oh no… please no. That can’t be it.</em></p>
<p>“Did I, uh… curse you out and hit you?”</p>
<p>Ara hesitated for a long moment before asking, her voice quiet like a puppy realizing it’s done something wrong.</p>
<p>“The fact that’s your first guess says a lot about what you secretly wish you could do.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung shrugged, seemingly amused. Before Ara could stammer out some excuse, he changed the subject swiftly.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’m busy. Much busier than you can imagine. How many times do I have to tell you before you believe it?”</p>
<p>His tone was probing, and Ara found herself shrinking slightly under the weight of his words. Her fingers fidgeted with the strap of her eco bag.</p>
<p>“But you still came with me to the market. And you saved me from those loan shark guys.”</p>
<p>“That’s because–”</p>
<p><em>Because it was an accident. Because Seol-do was being stubborn, and I just brought you along to quiet her. Because you happened to stumble into my personal time, my hobby of visiting the market. Seok-kyung thought.</em></p>
<p>Seok-kyung was about to shut down the conversation when Ara’s quiet voice interrupted his thoughts.</p>
<p>“You could’ve left me behind if you wanted to.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung froze in place, his deliberate, slowed pace coming to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>For the first time, he realized that he truly could have left her there. It had never even crossed his mind as an option.</p>
<p><em>Why didn’t I?</em></p>
<p>The idea that he could have chosen to abandon her felt so foreign, as though that possibility never existed in the first place. But now, standing in the quiet space between them, it suddenly seemed glaringly obvious.</p>
<p><em>Why didn’t I just leave her behind?</em></p>
<p>Seok-kyung couldn’t shake the thought. Leaving her behind would have been the most “him” thing to do. He hated anything that involved unnecessary hassle, especially when it came to humans. Had he forgotten that for a moment just because her reactions were amusing?</p>
<p>No, that didn’t make sense. He never made careless mistakes like that.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because he’d distanced himself from humans for too long? Some kind of withdrawal? A side effect of being disconnected for so long?</p>
<p>Or maybe… but what?</p>
<p>While Seok-kyung wrestled with his confusion, Ara stopped beside him, breaking his train of thought. Without warning, she bowed her head low.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Whatever your reasons were, you saved me. I’ll make sure to repay this debt.”</p>
<p>Ara looked up at him with a determined expression, meeting his eyes squarely.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung didn’t respond right away. A brief silence settled between them before his smooth lips slowly parted.</p>
<p>“Don’t make promises you can’t keep.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’m already in debt, so what’s one more favor to repay? It won’t change much.”</p>
<p>Ara flashed him a bright, nonchalant smile. Despite the underlying resignation in her tone, her smile was surprisingly genuine.</p>
<p>Once again, Seok-kyung didn’t reply—just sighed deeply and resumed walking.</p>
<p>By now, the entrance to the hiking trail was just ahead.</p>
<p>“By the way, are you okay after they grabbed your collar earlier?”</p>
<p>Ara fell in step beside him again, glancing briefly at his rumpled shirt.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung noticed her gaze and glanced down at the collar of his shirt as well.</p>
<p>“You should be more worried about that guy than me.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Your grandma didn’t teach you? Bad things happen when you mess with a goblin.”</p>
<p>“Wait, that’s real?”</p>
<p>Ara blinked her wide eyes, clearly surprised.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung stopped by the rock he had used to open the path earlier, shifting the bag in his right hand to his left.</p>
<p>“Yeah. So be careful. Mess with me, and you’ll regret it.”</p>
<p>Ara stopped beside him and scoffed.</p>
<p>“That goes for you too. I’m scarier than I look.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the grudge of a ghost… Yeah, that’s definitely creepy. Those grudges can be pretty intense.”</p>
<p>“Kim Seok-kyung!”</p>
<p>Ara’s shout echoed as Seok-kyung teased her, catching her off guard. He flicked his empty right hand casually, and with a clear sound, the scenery shifted. The familiar sight of the goblin’s mansion appeared through the now-open path.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the warning. I’ll be careful.” She muttered.</p>
<p>With that, his long legs stepped effortlessly over the boundary between the two spaces.</p>
<p>As Ara followed behind him, Seok-kyung crossed the mansion’s garden, his steps light. Though he didn’t notice, a rare, genuine smile played on his lips as he walked.</p>
