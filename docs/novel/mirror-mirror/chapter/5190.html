            <p><strong>Chapter 2.1</strong></p>
<p>Ara’s eyes flew open at the unfamiliar voice.</p>
<p>In the midst of a world turned upside down, a person she had never seen before was staring intently down at her.</p>
<p>A man. He looked to be in his mid-to-late twenties, dressed impeccably in a beige suit. He was tall and strikingly handsome.</p>
<p>Despite her inverted perspective, Ara could clearly see the man’s exceptional beauty. Even without proper lighting, his delicate features were as clear as if illuminated by a spotlight.</p>
<p>Elegant eyebrows, even slightly furrowed. Deep, jet-black eyes whose depths seemed unfathomable. A perfectly sculpted nose with an angle that seemed carved with meticulous precision. Neatly closed lips and a sharp, attractive jawline…</p>
<p>“What are you staring at so blankly? You’re going to bore a hole in my face.”</p>
<p>The man clicked his tongue and stepped back.</p>
<p>Only then did Ara regain her senses.</p>
<p>This was an abandoned house in the mountains, and the man was a complete stranger. Whether he was a ghost or a human, he was clearly dangerous to her.</p>
<p>She hurriedly raised her head and tried to stand up, but her legs, weak and unsteady, gave way beneath her.</p>
<p>“Even a newborn fawn would stumble less than you.”</p>
<p>The man clicked his tongue again, mocking her.</p>
<p>“No, this was just a mistake,” Ara retorted, glaring at him.</p>
<p>His calm demeanor made her feel more frustrated than afraid. Maybe it was because his comment wasn’t entirely wrong.</p>
<p>If he intended to kill her, he should just do it already. Why mock her instead? She was losing her balance, and he couldn’t even offer a hand to help.</p>
<p>Determined to prove herself, Ara gritted her teeth and tried to stand up again. This time, she managed to stay on her feet for about three seconds longer before collapsing again.</p>
<p>“Stop wasting your energy and just sit down.”</p>
<p>Damn it…</p>
<p>As much as it pained her pride, she no longer had the strength to get up. She patted her trembling legs with her fists and lifted her head.</p>
<p>“By the way, who are you?”</p>
<p>“Look, you’re the one who trespassed into someone else’s house. Who are you to ask who I am?”</p>
<p>“Someone else’s house?”</p>
<p>Ara cocked her head in confusion.</p>
<p>Someone else’s house? This was supposed to be an abandoned place, commonly known as a goblin house…</p>
<p>Wait. A goblin house?</p>
<p>“So, you’re the owner of this house…?”</p>
<p>Ara instinctively raised her hand and pointed at the man, trailing off. The man nodded slightly, as if confirming her suspicion.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Ara gasped and covered her mouth.</p>
<p>“…Are you Kim Seobang*?”</p>
<p>*T/N: Kim Seobang is a type of goblin (Dokkaebi) that looks like a human and treats humans as companions. This term is also an endearment, meaning “my husband” in Korea.</p>
<p>“Hey. Who’s your Seobang? Are you trying to ruin my marriage prospects or something?”</p>
<p>The man frowned deeply as if he had heard something he shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>Even with a frown, he was handsome.</p>
<p>Ara unconsciously admired him for a moment before belatedly furrowing her own eyebrows.</p>
<p>“My grandmother said so. She told me all goblins are called Kim Seobang.”</p>
<p>“That’s so old-fashioned. Who calls me that these days? This isn’t the Joseon Dynasty. Besides, there are female goblins, too. Would you call them Kim Seobang as well?”</p>
<p>“Well, no, but… Anyway, are you really Kim Seobang… I mean, a goblin?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>“Then the one who played tricks on me on the way here, that was you, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>His answer was so brazen it was almost proud.</p>
<p>Ara clenched her fists in anger. There was something more infuriating than the absurdity of a handsome man claiming to be a goblin.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that too much?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean, if you were going to let me in anyway, why not just let me in peacefully? Why go out of your way to harass me and make me suffer? That’s really mean.”</p>
<p>The man’s expression grew increasingly incredulous as Ara continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Hey, human woman.”</p>
<p>“Why, goblin man?” Ara retorted without backing down. At this point, it was all or nothing.</p>
<p>If he was going to kill her, let him try. What did she have to lose? Whether she died here or was dragged off and killed by loan sharks, death was death.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who trespassed into my house. The criminal? That’s you. If I call the police right now, you’ll be arrested on the spot.”</p>
<p>“What…”</p>
<p>Before she could retort what kind of a goblin calls the police, the man’s shadow loomed closer.</p>
<p>“Article 319 of the Criminal Code. Don’t you know about trespassing? Anyone who unlawfully enters a person’s residence, building under control, ship, aircraft, or occupied room can be imprisoned for up to three years or by a fine not exceeding 5 million won.”</p>
<p>The tall, slender shadow was more intimidating than she expected.</p>
<p>Ara blinked a few times, momentarily silent.</p>
<p>“Do you practice law on the side?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t have time for that. I’m busy.”</p>
