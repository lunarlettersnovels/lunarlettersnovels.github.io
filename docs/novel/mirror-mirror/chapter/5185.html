        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 4.2</strong></p>
<p>Ara looked down at her still-tingling legs. She could barely manage her own body, let alone carry bundles of cash down the mountain.</p>
<p>“So you’re really going to transfer the money? Through mobile banking?”</p>
<p>“Look, human girl. Let’s live in the present, be smart about it. You should expand your imagination.”</p>
<p>The man tapped his temple with his index finger.</p>
<p>Getting this kind of lecture from a goblin who must be at least a hundred years old…</p>
<p>Feeling her pride wounded, Ara struggled to stand on her wobbly legs. The world tilted back to a proper angle from the unusually low vantage point she had been in.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to steal someone else’s money and put it in my account, are you? Or hack a bank?”</p>
<p>“What exactly do you think goblins are?”</p>
<p>“The kind of malicious… spirits who would leave my legs like this and expect me to crawl down the mountain in the middle of the night.”</p>
<p>Ara pointed at her dirt-smeared legs.</p>
<p>The man quickly scanned her from head to toe. A short sigh escaped his lips.</p>
<p>“I have a lot to say, but I’ll just point out two things.”</p>
<p>He held up two sleek fingers in a V-shape.</p>
<p>“First, I’m not a spirit. Spirits and goblins are entirely different beings. One of my abilities is actually exorcising spirits.”</p>
<p>As he finished speaking, he folded his index finger, leaving only the middle finger extended.</p>
<p>In other words, Ara had just been flipped off without a chance to respond.</p>
<p>“Wow, did you leave that finger up on purpose? Do you even know American insults?”</p>
<p>As Ara realized she had been tricked and was about to protest, the man’s middle finger quickly folded back down.</p>
<p>His elegant hand, even with its pronounced knuckles, suddenly thrust the smartphone right in front of Ara’s face.</p>
<p>“Second, this really is a goblin’s magic club. It can create not just ten billion but a hundred billion or a trillion with just a few taps. It’s simply been conveniently merged with a smartphone.”</p>
<p>Ara grabbed his hand and pulled it down.</p>
<p>The man stiffened momentarily, then pulled his hand away from her grip, stepping back a couple of steps, a look of irritation on his face.</p>
<p>“Why would I go through the hassle of using an old-fashioned method for such a trivial amount when I can just tap a few times and be done with it?”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. I’ll give you my account number.”</p>
<p>Ara knew there was no point in arguing further.</p>
<p>She obediently recited her bank account number. The man listened and tapped away on his smartphone.</p>
<p>With nothing else to do, Ara sat back down and began tidying up the scattered cards.</p>
<p>“Check your account.”</p>
<p>It was over in an instant.</p>
<p>Before she could even put the cards back into their case, he spoke as if the matter was already settled.</p>
<p>Ara pulled her phone out of her front pocket. She had turned it off to avoid being tracked, so it took a while to boot up. She worried he might get impatient and rush her, but he waited quietly.</p>
<p>Finally, when the phone finished booting up, there was a new text message.</p>
<p>[Korean Bank]</p>
<p>[08/14 23:11]</p>
<p>[Deposit]</p>
<p>[1,000,000,000 won]</p>
<p>[Kim Seok-kyung]</p>
<p>Ara read the short message twice. It didn’t feel real.</p>
<p>To think it was such a simple problem to solve. She had quit her job and fled here, ready to die because of an enormous debt she couldn’t even grasp.</p>
<p>As she stared at the slightly teary-eyed screen, she chewed over the three letters at the bottom of the message.</p>
<p>“Who’s Kim Seok-kyung?”</p>
<p>“Me.”</p>
<p>“Goblins have names?”</p>
<p>“What, did you think they’d be called Goblin One, Goblin Two, or something? Do you even know how many goblins there are in the world?”</p>
<p>“Well, I didn’t know, so I asked. No need to get snippy about it.”</p>
<p>Ara pouted but thought to herself.</p>
<p>For an annoying goblin, he sure has a pretty name. And… a pretty face, too.</p>
<p>“Um… Kim Seok-kyung?”</p>
<p>Just as she was about to press the back button to exit the message, she noticed something.</p>
<p>“There’s a mistake with the deposit.”</p>
<p>Something about the message, which had seemed perfect until a moment ago, now felt incredibly off. Specifically, the numbers.</p>
<p>“A mistake?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You’re missing a zero.”</p>
<p>Ara counted the digits repeatedly with her eyes.</p>
<p>One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand, million, ten million, hundred million. No matter how many times she counted, the number of zeros following the one didn’t change.</p>
<p>He acted so smart, but he made such a simple mistake.</p>
<p>Ara stood up, smiling slyly, ready to tease Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>“Oh, that? It’s not a mistake.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I meant to send you one billion only.”</p>
<p>Ara’s smile froze as the reality of his words sank in.</p>
