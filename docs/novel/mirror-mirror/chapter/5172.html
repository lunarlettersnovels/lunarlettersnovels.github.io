        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 11.1</strong></p>
<p>Ara first checked the blue-haired man’s chest and beneath his nose. Fortunately, she felt slow but definite breathing. She then checked the red-haired man’s breathing and found he was alive as well.</p>
<p>Thank goodness.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Ara reached into her pocket to call 119 but then threw her phone aside.</p>
<p>This was a goblin’s house. 119 wouldn’t be able to find it.</p>
<p>Who are these people? Why are they lying here bleeding? And why is Kim Seok-kyung, that lousy goblin, taking so long?</p>
<p>With a confused expression, Ara gently tilted the heads of the two men back. If their airways were blocked, they might suffocate.</p>
<p>Should I do chest compressions? Mouth-to-mouth? Why can’t I remember anything? I took a CPR course, didn’t I…?</p>
<p>“Wak!”</p>
<p>At that moment, the blue-haired man, who had been lying as if dead, suddenly sat up with a scream.</p>
<p>“Kyah!”</p>
<p>Ara shrieked, nearly collapsing from shock.</p>
<p>Wham!</p>
<p>Simultaneously, her fist, thrown unconsciously, struck the man’s face directly.</p>
<p>“Ow…”</p>
<p>The blue-haired man clutched his face with both hands and fell to the side.</p>
<p>Ara opened her tightly shut eyes. Still clutching her pounding heart, she sank to the floor when she heard rustling behind her.</p>
<p>“I told you not to scare her.”</p>
<p>Thud, thud. The red-haired man casually spoke as he stood up and brushed off his clothes. With a nonchalant hand, he took a black handkerchief from his jacket pocket and wiped the fake blood from around his mouth.</p>
<p>Ara looked up at the red-haired man with a blank expression. Noticing her gaze, the man pointed to the sprawled blue-haired man.</p>
<p>“It was his idea. I had no choice but to go along with it.”</p>
<p>Ara blinked her large eyes silently for a moment, then suddenly bit her lip and glared at the blue-haired man.</p>
<p>The blue-haired man peeked through his fingers to gauge the situation. When his eyes met Ara’s, he quickly pretended innocence and covered his face again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ara’s scattered thoughts returned.</p>
<p>Oh. So it was all a joke. Haha. A joke…</p>
<p>Smack!</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Ara slapped the blue-haired man’s back. It was a forceful and precise hit.</p>
<p>“Ouch!”</p>
<p>“I thought you were really hurt! Why would you scare me like that? Why!”</p>
<p>Whack, smack!</p>
<p>Her sharp hands continued to leave their mark on the man’s back. He almost crawled away to a spot where Ara’s hands couldn’t reach.</p>
<p>“Why would I scare you? Because I’m a goblin! Playing tricks is an important virtue of goblins!”</p>
<p>The man groaned, clutching his stinging back. The fake blood smeared around his mouth, making his face look like a bloody mess.</p>
<p>A goblin? Not a human, but a goblin?</p>
<p>Gritting her teeth, Ara stood up. She had hit him so hard her palm was tingling and hot.</p>
<p>Well, it makes sense that only extraordinary beings would be in this strange and special world.</p>
<p>But what difference does it make? The fact that she was scared doesn’t change.</p>
<p>Just as Ara, still angry, was about to go at him again, a voice interrupted.</p>
<p>“We have a guest, so can’t you make a quiet entrance?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung suddenly appeared from behind.</p>
<p>“Ouch, that hurts. Cheong-seon is dying here.”</p>
<p>The blue-haired man, Cheong-seon, immediately covered his face again and collapsed sideways upon seeing Seok-kyung. His long limbs curled up defensively.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung, familiar with such antics, took a few more steps toward Cheong-seon. The toe of his well-polished leather shoe nudged Cheong-seon’s knee.</p>
<p>“Lee Cheong-seon, stop pretending and get up.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I’ll count to three. One, two…”</p>
<p>Before Seok-kyung could finish, Cheong-seon sprang to his feet. He walked straight past Seok-kyung and approached Ara.</p>
<p>“Hello. I’m Cheong-seon, Lee Cheong-seon. You’re Ara, right? I’ve heard a lot about you from Seol Do-han. It’s the first time His Majesty…”</p>
<p>Thud. The red-haired man standing beside him elbowed Cheong-seon in the ribs.</p>
<p>“Ow, why did you hit me!”</p>
<p>“Idiot, did you eat all your senses for breakfast?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s sharp reprimand was as piercing as his eyes. Cheong-seon rubbed his bruised side, silently mouthing curses. When he made eye contact with Seok-kyung, he stopped and clamped his mouth shut.</p>
<p>“I’m Lee Hong-seon.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the red-haired man, Hong-seon, was the complete opposite of Cheong-seon. He greeted Ara politely.</p>
<p>“My name is Na Ara,” she responded.</p>
<p>Ara, still in a daze, gave a slight bow.</p>
<p>Though Hong-seon was also one of the pranksters, he had cleverly shifted the blame onto Cheong-seon from the start, making it awkward to question him further. It seemed like a very shrewd move if it was planned.</p>
<p>But… are they both goblins? Cheong-seon had admitted as much earlier. Hong-seon must be one too, right? Their names even sound like they’re brothers. Given their completely different faces, are they fraternal twins?</p>
