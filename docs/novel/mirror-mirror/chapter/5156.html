        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 19.1</strong></p>
<p>The market square in the town, where the five-day market was being held, was bustling with life.</p>
<p>Stall vendors had spread out their wares, and shoppers carrying baskets wove through the crowd, their voices mingling in a pleasant cacophony of haggling and chatter.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung strolled leisurely through the throng, taking in the sights. Ara stuck close behind him, but every time he stopped abruptly without a word, she would end up bumping her forehead against his shoulder.</p>
<p>“At least give me a heads-up when you’re going to stop.”</p>
<p>Ara grumbled, rubbing her sore forehead.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be easier if you just kept some distance?”</p>
<p>“There are too many people. If I get separated, I might get lost.”</p>
<p>“You’re not a toddler. So what if you get lost for a bit? You know where I live now, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Sure, I know. The problem is whether I can make it back there in one piece.”</p>
<p>Ara clutched her bag tightly with both hands, glancing around nervously. She was prepared to use Seok-kyung as a human shield and make a run for it if any loan sharks were lurking nearby.</p>
<p>It might have seemed a bit extreme, but it was the best defense she could muster. After all, there was no way a goblin king would fall victim to something as trivial as a loan shark.</p>
<p>Even a beggar’s life in this world is better than being dead, so I’ll survive first and worry about the rest later.</p>
<p>Resolute in her sneaky determination, Ara quickly scurried after Seok-kyung, who had already moved ahead.</p>
<p>The man in the navy suit came to a halt a few steps ahead, then slipped into a vegetable shop on the right.</p>
<p>Ara’s white sneakers quickly followed.</p>
<p>But just as she was about to step through the open door, her forehead smacked into Seok-kyung’s back again, bouncing her back slightly.</p>
<p>“Oh my, who do we have here? Our handsome young man!”</p>
<p>The shop owner, an elderly woman, called out from in front of Seok-kyung, who was standing like a wall.</p>
<p>Rubbing her sore forehead, Ara glared at Seok-kyung’s back. He knew I was right behind him. This sneaky goblin. He totally did it on purpose. A hundred percent.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while. Have you been busy?” the old woman asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve had a lot on my plate,” Seok-kyung replied.</p>
<p>Ara blinked in surprise, her brows knitting together unconsciously.</p>
<p>Did he just say <em>yes</em>? <em>Kim Seok-kyung</em>?</p>
<p>“Is that so? I’ve been waiting for you, hoping to see you every day. What brings you here today?”</p>
<p>“Eggplants, angelica tree shoots, tomatoes, and some wild sesame leaves. Oh, and if you have any sweet potatoes, I’d like to see those too.”</p>
<p>“Of course, we have everything here. Come on in and pick them out yourself.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung nodded slightly in acknowledgment and headed further into the shop.</p>
<p>Ara stood there, staring blankly after him. Even the great Kim Seok-kyung uses formal speech with an elderly human. Who knew he had such social skills?</p>
<p>“Come on in, pretty lady. What would you like to buy?”</p>
<p>The shop owner finally noticed Ara after Seok-kyung had moved on.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m just… here with him,” Ara stammered, pointing towards Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>Ara pointed toward Seok-kyung, who was busy filling a basket with tomatoes on the other side of the shop.</p>
<p>“That handsome young man?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yes… haha, that’s right…”</p>
<p>As she suspected, the standards of beauty were the same, whether young or old, goblin or human.</p>
<p>Ara, as usual, couldn’t find the right words to respond and ended up smiling awkwardly.</p>
<p>“You’re not the girl who usually comes with him.”</p>
<p>The shop owner scrutinized Ara’s face, tilting her head in confusion. She must have found it odd that someone other than Seol-do was accompanying Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>“Oh, right. I’m just here instead of her today.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then what’s your relationship with him?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The girl who usually comes said she’s his sister. So, are you his girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“What? No, no, it’s not like that,” Ara trailed off, at a loss for how to explain.</p>
<p>A debtor under contract with a goblin? She won’t believe it.</p>
<p>But what should she say? They weren’t friends, siblings, or family.</p>
<p>‘I’m a housekeeper temporarily hired for three months? We’re in a relationship where we exchange wishes on an installment plan?</p>
<p>“Uh, we’re just… living together for a bit due to some circumstances.”</p>
<p>In the end, she settled on a vague explanation. Technically, it wasn’t a lie.</p>
<p>“Well, well. So you two haven’t had your wedding yet?”</p>
<p>The problem was that the shop owner’s imagination had taken a wild turn.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Good for you. When you live together, it’s only a matter of time before you become husband and wife. Well done. You’ve got a good eye for people.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that…”</p>
