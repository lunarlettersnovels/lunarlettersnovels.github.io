            <p><strong>Chapter 8.1</strong></p>
<p>“Yes, but there’s so much I want to ask. I don’t know where to start,” Ara admitted, sighing along with her words.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung chuckled, clearly not expecting such a straightforward response.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you lie, even though you’re not a goblin?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? I’m great at lying,” Ara retorted.</p>
<p>“Sure you are,” Seok-kyung murmured almost inaudibly.</p>
<p>“Fine, let’s pretend you are. Just say what you need to say… I might be able to listen to at least one thing.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung glanced at his wristwatch, then nodded slightly, indicating she should speak.</p>
<p>Ara gathered the myriad of questions she wanted to ask him all at once.</p>
<p>Where exactly is this place? Why didn’t you mention being a king from the beginning? Why did you change your mind and let me stay in your house? Did something happen last night?</p>
<p>“Am I to prepare meals from now on? You said you were assessing if I could handle your generosity, not that you were hiring me as a housemaid,” she finally asked, feeling this was the most appropriate question to ask at the dining table.</p>
<p>“Housemaid, huh? That doesn’t sound quite right.” Seok-kyung’s calm expression faltered slightly, his eyebrows knitting together. The morning sunlight streaming through the half-open window cast a glimmer in his dark eyes.</p>
<p>“Housekeeper. Isn’t that a bit better?”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>Ara leaned forward. She was fine with cooking but this was not in their contract. How more is he not telling her? A goblin is a trickster.</p>
<p>“This is not about the terminology. You can’t just decide these things on your own,” she continued, “You should’ve told me earlier that I am going to be a servant. I am a guest.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung remained unfazed, his gaze steady. “You are indeed a guest, but as long as you are under my roof, you will have to follow some rules. Consider this part of the assessment, if you will.”</p>
<p>“Assessment for what, exactly?” Ara questioned.</p>
<p>“To see if you truly belong here,” Seok-kyung replied, his tone unwavering. “This house, this world… it’s not for everyone. But if you prove yourself capable, then perhaps you can stay.”</p>
<p>Ara took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. “Fine, I’ll do it. But not because you’re forcing me. Because I want to prove that I can handle whatever this place throws at me.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s lips curved into a slight smile. “Good. Now, let’s enjoy the meal you’ve prepared.”</p>
<p>He pursed his lips and shrugged his shoulders slightly, as if he were watching a petulant child sulking over a lost treat.</p>
<p>“To answer your question, yes, I never explicitly said I’d use you as a housemaid. But I never said I wouldn’t use you as a housekeeper either.”</p>
<p>“That’s just a verbal trick.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. But what can you do about it?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung tilted his gaze slightly and smirked, his expression almost mocking.</p>
<p>“Anyway, you can leave this house right now. I won’t stop you.”</p>
<p>Ara could only glare at him. The saying goes, the landlord is the highest authority, and this guy fits that perfectly.</p>
<p>“Do you even realize how unreasonable this contract is?”</p>
<p>“Typical of a human, Ara. No sense of reason. Nothing in this world comes for free.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung clicked his tongue and dropped his hand from his chin. He leaned back arrogantly in his chair, looking up at Ara with an air of nonchalance.</p>
<p>“Besides, with the interest on ten billion won and the cost of living here for three months, it’s not just generous, it’s more than you deserve.”</p>
<p>Ara opened her mouth to retort but fell silent, her mind racing to compute the implications. The mention of including room and board meant she would indeed be provided for at no cost for at least three months.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that you’ll provide free room and board for three months?” she asked, her voice steadying. She needed to make sure there weren’t any hidden costs he might have in mind, aside from the cooking, which she’d be more than happy to handle.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m like you humans? Flip-flopping on my words?”</p>
<p>“Promise me. Seal it with a signature.”</p>
<p>Ara extended her hand, fingers spread—thumb and pinky outstretched—toward Seok-kyung, making a gesture for a handshake.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung squinted, clearly bewildered by the gesture.</p>
<p>“Who makes promises with a finger cross these days?”</p>
<p>“Just do it. It doesn’t cost anything.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t take it even if you paid me. Get rid of it.”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung flicked Ara’s hand away with a dismissive gesture and turned his head away sharply.</p>
<p>His temper was as prickly as ever.</p>
<p>Ara grumbled inwardly but straightened up, a smile forming on her lips despite the refusal. Although her request for a pinky promise was denied, she felt quite good.</p>
<p>Well, it’s just a new opportunity. Cooking every day here won’t be much different from cooking every day at home. It’s a chance for self-fulfillment and making a fortune—killing two birds with one stone, as they say.</p>
