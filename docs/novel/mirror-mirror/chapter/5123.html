            <p><strong>Chapter 35.2</strong></p>
<p>Dreams, they said, were made from fragments of what one knew. Yet the face rippling on the water’s surface was entirely unfamiliar. A child this cute and endearing was impossible to forget even if she’d only passed by her once, but no matter how hard Ara searched her memories, she couldn’t recall ever meeting such a girl.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all that, there was something oddly familiar and comforting about the face. It was strange, almost as if a long-lost connection was tugging at her heart.</p>
<p><em>—Who are you?</em></p>
<p>Ara murmured softly as she crouched by the pebbled edge. The girl in the water mirrored her movement, leaning forward to match Ara’s gaze.</p>
<p>For a mere shadow reflected in the water, why did it evoke such a profound sense of longing and sorrow?</p>
<p>Ara was just reaching out to touch the surface when—</p>
<p><em>—Hey.</em></p>
<p>A voice called out to her.</p>
<p>Startled, she withdrew her hand and turned toward the source of the sound.</p>
<p>In the idyllic scenery behind her, a man and a woman stood together, cradling a small child. Beside them was a boy who appeared to be around the upper grades of elementary school.</p>
<p><em>—What are you doing over there? Come here, quickly.</em></p>
<p>Ara didn’t know who they were, but somehow, she felt an unshakable certainty that this girl—the child she now embodied—was part of their family.</p>
<p>Almost as if enchanted, Ara stood and began walking toward them. Her silk shoes rustled pleasantly against the grass, producing a soft, satisfying sound.</p>
<p><em>—My dear, your father has prepared a very special gift for your eighth birthday,</em> said the woman, likely the girl’s mother, smiling warmly while gently rocking the child in her arms.</p>
<p><em>—Well, special might be a bit of an exaggeration…</em></p>
<p><em>—Nonsense! Didn’t you summon every renowned artisan in the capital to create it?</em></p>
<p>At the woman’s teasing remark, the man, seemingly her father, coughed awkwardly, clearly embarrassed.</p>
<p><em>—It’s true! Even I was tempted—it’s such an extraordinary gift! Come on, show it to her! She’s going to love it!</em></p>
<p>The boy, who was probably the girl’s older brother, playfully tugged at their father’s arm, which he had been hiding behind his back.</p>
<p>Giving in with a resigned chuckle, the man finally brought his hand forward.</p>
<p><em>—…My dear, thank you for being born as our daughter.</em></p>
<p>With those words, he took her small hand in his own, placed a palm-sized box onto it, and added, <em>—May your life be filled with endless happiness.</em></p>
<p>His gruff yet affectionate voice carried a quiet blessing as Ara stared down at the box, her heart pounding with an inexplicable emotion.</p>
<p>Whatever was inside the box, it was clear that the greatest gift this child had ever received was the love and attention of her family. Still, given how everyone had been praising it so much, she couldn’t help but be curious.</p>
<p>The father’s sun-weathered face broke into a wide, contented smile as he watched her eager expression. Slowly, he began to lift the lid of the box—</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>─<em>Thwack!</em></p>
<p>A sharp, crisp sound pierced her ears.</p>
<p>In an instant, the world flipped upside down. The loving family and the anticipated gift vanished into pitch-black darkness. All that remained was a dizzying sense of vertigo as the familiar sensations of reality began returning one by one.</p>
<p>“Na Ara, just how long are you planning to keep pretending you’re asleep?”</p>
<p>Even this aggravating yet annoyingly smooth voice.</p>
<p>Ara slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>The faint light of dawn seeped into her room. Instead of the fluffy dog that usually woke her up, standing by her bedside, staring down at her, was none other than Seok-kyung.</p>
<p>“Guess I got a goblin instead of a dog today…”</p>
<p>“…A goblin?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung’s brow furrowed slightly, failing to fully grasp her muttered words.</p>
<p><em>Even when he frowned, the guy was absurdly handsome.</em></p>
<p>Ara grumbled to herself inwardly, yawning wide enough to split her face. “Haaaaahhh.” She stretched lazily, but the tranquility on her face didn’t last long.</p>
<p>“Wait a second.”</p>
<p>This is my room. I just woke up. I’m obviously in pajamas, so…</p>
<p>“Who told you—you—who said you could come in here?!”</p>
<p>Startled, Ara practically yelled the words.</p>
<p>Seok-kyung leaned back ever so slightly, as if to shield his ears, his fingers barely brushing his temple. After a beat, he gave her a faintly aggrieved look.</p>
<p>“Where in my house am I not allowed to go?”</p>
<p>“Here! This is a <em>lady’s</em> room!”</p>
<p>“A lady?”</p>
<p>Seok-kyung repeated the word like it was the most absurd thing he’d ever heard. His brows arched in disbelief, their slanted tilt a clear indication that he wasn’t buying her argument at all.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t understand, Seok-kyung. You’re not a gentleman. But let me tell you, barging in like this is the kind of thing only a brute would do!”</p>
<p>Ara crossed her arms in an exaggerated X over her chest and scooted backward on her bed, indignation practically radiating off her. The motion caused the neckline of her oversized, worn-out white t-shirt to slip down one shoulder, baring her collarbone.</p>
