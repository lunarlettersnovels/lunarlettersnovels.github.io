            <p><strong>Chapter 5</strong></p>
<p>“Ahhh…!”</p>
<p>It was the first time in her life to encounter a naked man. Anyway, thankfully, at least, he had around his waist a thin cloth; well, technically he was holding it up. With her face burning up at the sight of his naked body, Chesney took a few steps back.</p>
<p>“We can’t take our marriage back once we spend the night together.”</p>
<p>His low-toned voice sounded good in her ears. But she couldn’t lift her head yet.</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>He stopped talking for a moment and reached out to touch her cheek. Then he put his thick fingers between her light golden hairs and squeezed her scalp lightly.</p>
<p>“Assuming that neither of us makes a reason for destroying this marriage over the next year.”</p>
<p>Was that a threat? Chesney kept her eyes on him as he bowed and kissed her hand. As he did that, with his head still bowed he raised his eyes to face her. Chesney nodded. No doubt that was a threat. She was certain that whatever happened in this bedroom, their marriage would be destroyed if she rejected him.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know… It can nullify our marriage…”</p>
<p>That was her habit. In the House of Atelian, Chesney was the most useless baggage. That’s why she had to prove to Duchess Atelian every time that she understood at least what she said. Otherwise, she would receive a fierce lashing. Primera erased the hazy smile from his face and lifted Chesney’s. Then, he carried her over to the bed and laid her down.</p>
<p>“You’ve become very skinny,” he told her before even removing her gown.</p>
<p>Afraid that he’d be unsatisfied with her physique, Chesney carefully placed her hand over the man’s hand trying to take off her gown. She wanted a chance to give an excuse. And her body wasn’t much to look at, since she hadn’t been eating properly these days. Chesney wanted to persuade him that if he didn’t give up and took her to the palace of Belcansus, she would definitely make her body fit his liking.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to spend this first night together?”</p>
<p>At his words, Chesney shook her head. The marriage couldn’t be canceled. And she did not want to go back to the home she’d been raised. This marriage is the only way for Chesney to find a way to live.</p>
<p>“It’s not that…”</p>
<p>“If not, then what?”</p>
<p>A bright smile appeared on the man’s handsome face for the first time, revealing the fangs through the soft curve in his open lips. <em>Barbarian.</em> Chesney suddenly recalled that one word. Soon after, there was a beast in front of her loosening her gown; rushing in like a mad animal to covet her breasts.</p>
<p>“Grrr…”</p>
<p>This embarrassment was indescribable. Having had her gown removed, the cold air felt like ice on her bare skin. But the cold sensation didn’t last long. Chesney’s breast, which had never been touched by anyone, disappeared into the man’s mouth; his hot breath pouring over her nipples as he licked and sucked.</p>
<p>After teasing her two round nipples with his lips to his heart’s content, he changed his destination and headed down her belly, which didn’t have an ounce of fat on it. With his breath softly touching her flesh, it felt like a huge cauldron of boiling water was placed next to the bed to heat the room. Thanks to this, Chesney’s beautiful eyes, which seemed to hold dark brown jewels, began to tear up with even more embarrassment. The physical relationship between men and women was not an act that could only be expressed through the words ‘making love’. All the books she had read in the meantime didn’t help one bit in subduing the feeling of shame.</p>
<p>“Why are you crying?”</p>
<p>The man who coveted her breasts like he was going to eat her up asked in a stumped voice after belatedly discovering the tears in her eyes. Without saying a word, Chesney only shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m putting it in.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Chesney couldn’t figure out what he was about to <em>‘put in’</em> but knew exactly where he was planning to put it. She felt a thin, sticky liquid in her secret spot. He twisted the oval button and threw off the cloth covering his lower body. Then, his large, red member, which was firmly erect, shook gracefully and entered the place where Chesney’s eyes were looking.</p>
<p>“Uh, uhhh…”</p>
<p><em>Is this thing really inside me? </em>Chesney could not believe it. This tiny gap where a finger could barely fit in was far too narrow to take in his forearm-sized thing. She hurriedly lowered her hand to cover the sight of it. But he lightly tapped the timid and rebellious act with one swipe of his hand, continuing his business.</p>
<p>“Your M-Majesty…”</p>
<p>The tip of White’s member touched the very depths of her insides. For the heavy phallus to enter the small gap, the hymen had been forced to open. Chesney closed her eyes tightly and trembled at this first-time pain,</p>
<p>“Uhhh…”</p>
<p>As soon as White heard the groan, he stopped his waist movements for a moment and held her in his arms. When he did that, the sound of his heart, beating like it’d burst in any second, penetrated Chesney’s ears. No doubt the barbaric man was horny. Chesney clenched her jaw, enduring the urge to moan. If she only gets through the first night, gives him physical pleasure, and proves to him that she is worth something, he just may need her after all.  She could withstand any pain, at least to avoid having to nullify their marriage.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?” he asked attentively. If she told him that it hurt, would he indeed stop here? Chesney hesitated for a second before nodding. She didn’t see him as someone who would stop when he heard that she was hurt</p>
<p>“I’m fine. K-keep…”</p>
<p>As soon as she said she was fine, he buried his rock-hard member back inside her. Her narrow, hot inner walls welcomed him.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>On the contrary to Chesney who was in pain, White’s sculpture-like face had a satisfactory smile.</p>
<p>She felt relieved. White lifted her feet and put them up to the back of his neck as she winced in indescribable pain, but that was enough as long as he needed her.</p>
<p>“Whew.”</p>
<p>White, whose eyes were blurred by the sexual excitement, closed his eyes and tilted his head back for a while, then lowered it back. After grabbing Chesney’s hand that was pushing on his chest, he bit it softly with his sharp teeth, then buried his face in her thin arms to inhale her body scent. At the same time, his rod that was squeezing its way through her insides grew more erect as it went in deeper. The protruding veins leading to Chesney’s glistening folds remained as evidence.</p>
<p>White, who had started to gyrate his waist through the desire and instinct, suddenly distorted his handsome face and put Chesney’s arm to the side. Then he took <em>his</em> out from inside of her.</p>
<p>“Shit.” He uttered a curse.</p>
<p>His wonderful low-pitched voice fit perfectly with the swearing. Maybe that’s why he looked even scarier. Chesney stared at her new husband with fearful eyes. However, White, on the other hand, grabbed his gown from the back of the chair and stormed out of the room without even looking at her once.</p>
<p>Slam. The sound of the slamming door, with no consideration for the person who was left behind, made her ears ring and her heart cry.</p>
