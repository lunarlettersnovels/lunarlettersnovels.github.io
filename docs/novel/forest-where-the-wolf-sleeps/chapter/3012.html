            <p><strong>Chapter 4</strong></p>
<p>The continent of Finn was located north of the Sepion Empire and the Ibelian Kingdom. Unlike Euron, Belcansus was a barbaric place that commanded and governed other mysterious tribes and the wildlands of beasts.</p>
<p>Over the years, Chesney, Duke Atelian’s illegitimate child, had been thoroughly hidden. However, no matter how much he tried to hide her, there were no secrets where people walked. So many tailors, servants, and other shop staff members who had already visited the duke’s mansion knew the beautiful appearance of the veiled Chesney. Even though the Atelians were rich and powerful nobles, they could not keep the common people from talking.</p>
<p>It was Sepion’s public secret that the duke’s illegitimate child named Chesney Atelian was fascinating enough to remind them of the word ‘elf’ that was used as a pronoun for beauty.</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony started after a while, and a piano accompanied by a harp began playing music. When Chesney appeared in the garden wearing a white wedding dress, people’s heads turned as if they’d seen an angel. Hundreds of pairs of eyes gazed at her.</p>
<p>Among those gathered here, the only one who wasn’t convinced of this wedding was Uriel. The downside of Chesney being a fake princess was that her beauty had been lightly tossed aside and left alone. Uriel glared at her with venomous eyes. She hadn’t been able to sleep all night because it was unfair that Chesney took this fortune only because she had made a fuss about marrying a barbarian.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on your wedding.”</p>
<p>Duke Atelian extended his white-gloved hand to Chesney. His words felt more like something a duke would say rather than what a father would say.</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you. Sir.”</p>
<p>She took one step at a time carefully, to prevent herself from wobbling in the high heels, and before long she arrived in front of White.</p>
<p>While the Archbishop of Sepion, who officiated, read the marriage pledge, Chesney carefully glanced at White’s shoes. Afraid she’ll meet his sharp gaze while glancing at his handsome figure, she didn’t dare to admire him properly.</p>
<p>“Chesney Atelian, do you swear to love and cherish White Primera Belcansus for the rest of your life, so death do you part?”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>What’s the meaning of swearing to love in a loveless marriage? Chesney turned to face White after answering.</p>
<p>Taking the ring from the small box the archbishop was holding, White got down on one knee and extended a hand, figuratively asking Chesney for her hand. It was a precious ring that would tie the couple’s future.</p>
<p>She held out a shaky hand and watched him take the ring, when, <em>clank, clack, </em>the ring fell onto the white-painted wooden floor the moment their hands touched. Chesney was suddenly frightened because it was obvious that it’d happen due to her trembling hand knocking the ring out of White’s hand.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>White shut his eyes for a moment before opening them again and picking up the fallen ring with an ugly look on his face. Then, after quickly putting the ring on Chesney’s finger, he stood up without looking into her eyes. As soon as the guests whispered behind their backs, the archbishop, who felt the mood changing, omitted all the procedures of making the couple seal their oaths with a kiss and march hand in hand. At the end of the wedding ceremony, which seemed to be on thin ice, White glanced at Chesney and quietly whispered, “Damn you.”</p>
<p>His voice was low, but Chesney, who was right next to him, clearly heard the low-pitched cursing. It was abominable that the pathetic bride was the butt of the guests’ ridicule for having such a sloppy wedding.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes tightly to keep from crying. The phrase ‘useless Chesney’, which she has heard countless times as a fake princess of the House of Atelian, had become a reality. Perhaps there was no place in this world for her. Eventually, tears started pouring out of her bitter eyes. What the most beautiful bride in the world shed at her wedding was not tears of joy but tears of sorrow.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Mr. Primera is waiting in the bedroom.”</p>
<p>Finishing her bath, Chesney came out of the bathroom and was immediately taken aback by those words. Because she was terrified of having to spend the night with her new husband, White Primera Belcansus, the Emperor of Belcansus whom many called ‘barbaric’.</p>
<p>“All right…”</p>
<p>Now that it was about to happen, she became dizzy as if she were looking down from a cliff.</p>
<p>She had no clue what exactly would happen on their first night. However, she had heard through a few conversations with her friends and Uriel.</p>
<p><em>‘According to Mrs. Ontragen, men and women sometimes see blood when they first have a physical relationship.’</em></p>
<p>On top of that, a few days ago Uriel had even straight up mentioned something as if she’d wanted Chesney to hear it.</p>
<p><em>‘The men in Belcansus have a strong barbaric temperament, so no matter how much that clump of cheese begs him to stop, he won’t.’</em></p>
<p>From what they had said, it was clear that something very frightening happened on a newlywed’s first night.</p>
<p>“Should I open the door for you, ma’am?”</p>
<p>When Chesney stood hesitantly in front of the door, one of Primera’s servants, whether he knew how she felt or not, sent her an unnecessary consideration.</p>
<p>“No, I will open it myself.”</p>
<p>Taking a few deep breaths to calm her racing heart, she made up her mind. <em>Whatever happens in there, I will not tamper with his feelings</em>. She felt tears coming on when she recalled again the furious look on his face she’d seen at the ceremony.</p>
<p>“I am going in.”</p>
<p>As soon as she grabbed the door handle of the room decorated in silver, she turned it and entered. All of a sudden the man’s solid and bare chest fell into her vision.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…!”</p>
