<p><strong>Chapter 31.1</strong></p>
<p>Five years had already passed since Count Limon’s unfortunate accident. But these days, there are rumors that within the past two years his health had drastically declined.</p>
<p>“Fortunately Lord Van Wert’s absence isn’t that big. Since Master Irvan grew up well and is now managing the Knight Order well, and Lady Karina and Sir Collin are knowledgeable and talented in many ways. The two of them put in a lot of effort to develop the land, so people’s livelihoods are getting better day by day,” said Baron Berne, narrowing his eyes.</p>
<p>However, Emma wasn’t naive enough to believe what he was saying. From his expression after mentioning Karina and Collin, it was easy to see that not all of what he had said was true.</p>
<p>“Shall we look around the buildings now? Over there is the main building of Van Wert Castle,” he said, changing the topic.</p>
<p>As the baron guided them there, Emma tried to recall when she had met Countess Karina a few days ago. She was a flawless beauty with a welcoming personality, but beneath the sweet words, she could sense her dislike for Irvan. After getting a better understanding of Irvan’s relationship with the woman from Baron Berne’s explanation, Emma could deduce she was like a typical model of a stepmother, acting unfairly to a son that wasn’t hers.</p>
<p>She had to be extremely careful in front of Countess Karina.</p>
<p>While Emma was carefully gathering her thoughts, Baron Berne pointed in front of him with his golden cane.</p>
<p>“Uh, excuse me –“ Emma began, but her words soon faltered.</p>
<p>A man in his mid-thirties was getting out of a carriage in front of the main building’s fountain, and he was with a healthy-looking clergywoman.</p>
<p>“There’s an old saying that if you call upon a fairy, it will appear; I guess it really is true,” Baron Berne mumbled from beside her.</p>
<p>Emma lifted her eyes and studied the scene in front of her. When she did, the man stopped in front of the carriage as if he felt someone watching him. He teruned his head towards them. It was Collin Muns.</p>
<p>Collin glanced at the baron, then slightly shifted his eyes to Emma. Her first impression of Countess Karina’s twin brother Collin was not all that good. His appearance was neat, but his eyes were too muddy. They looked like pits filled with old, stale water.</p>
<p>It was Emma’s first time to feel uncomfortable through only someone’s stare. It was completely different from the cold, chilly look in Irvan’s eyes. If his blue-gray eyes were like the pure, serene glaciers, Collin’s eyes were like mud with all kinds of trash mixed together.</p>
<p>As soon as she encountered the dark green eyes, she felt disgust creep within her. With her body stiff, she almost retracted her steps in a daze. Her heart was disturbed and beating furiously in alarm.</p>
<p>Collin narrowed his eyes at her, then he approached the baron with wide strides</p>
<p>“Baron Berne. So we meet again,” he greeted.</p>
<p>Baron Berne tilted his head in answer. “Where are you coming from, sir?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I had some things to discuss with Bishop Albert. Nothing too important.”</p>
<p>Collin lifted his hand and pointed to the carriage. Then, the bishop dressed in a red robe smiled kindly and greeted them with a wink. Baron Berne and Emma took the informal gesture a bit aghast.</p>
<p>Collin, who was watching the scene quietly, fixed his gaze on Emma. “By the way, who is this young, beautiful woman?” he said.</p>
<p>“A guest of Irvan, sir,” Baron Berne answered.</p>
<p>Collin’s eyebrows raised. “ A guest? Master Irvan is a prominent figure, I see. Pleased to meet you. I am Collin Muns.”</p>
<p>Far from a normal greeting, Collin scanned Emma’s body from head to toe with an undisguised perverted look in his eyes.</p>
<p>The sense of alarm inside her wasn’t loss, but grew more, and goosebumps erupted in her skin from from his dirty gaze. It made her feel like a dirty insect was crawling inside her skin form the look in his eyes alone.</p>
<p>Emma, uncomfortable, lowered her head as to not give away how she felt. “…I am Emerlin Herman. From Summerville,” she quietly said.</p>
<p>Collin laughed mirthlessly. “Such a far place. I guess you and Irvan have a special relationship, madam.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>As soon as she closed her lips, ending the conversationwith a curt reply, Collin quickly fired another question.  “So what brings you here to Reshire, Miss Herman? Is it your first time?”</p>
<p>“I was on my way to Polarville. I dropped by here for a bit,” Emma answered, her palms beginning to sweat.</p>
<p>“Polarville? Summerville indeed is a long journey, but that place is far as well. How long do you plan on staying in Reshire, madam?”</p>
<p>“Uh… I haven’t decided yet, sir.”</p>
<p>Collin showed excitement at Emma’s hesitant reply. “Is that so? Still, if you have a destination, you must have a plan. Haven’t uyou planned your journey, yet? Reshire must be your stopover, then.”</p>
<p>“I don’t feel comfortable saying that here. I think it will be better if I tell Irvan later.” When Collin, who showed excessive interest in her, tried to pry on her affairs, Emma briefly brought Irvan’s name as an excuse.</p>
<p>“Irvan…” Collin sighed and rubbed his chin as if he were offended.</p>
<p>“Since he is the one whom I received the invitation from,” Emma added, aggressively using Irvan as a shield. She was a commoner anyway, thus unfamiliar with the way nobles spoke.</p>
<p>She may get caught if she were to hastily bring her matters into the light. For now, it was better to dump everything onto Irvan.</p>
