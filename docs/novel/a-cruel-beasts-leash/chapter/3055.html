            <p><strong>Chapter 61.1</strong></p>
<p>One had black hair, the other, blonde. After Karina Muns arrived at Van Wert Castle and became Countess, there was a lot of talk that she had chosen her ladies-in-waiting based on their looks. The beautiful maids received a lot of attention within the Castle, especially in the Knights Templar which was full of men. They used to be the topic of interest, but at some point, they became the subject of poor, dirty jokes.</p>
<p>Countess Karina’s maids have three different, respectable names, but Irvan, who couldn’t remember, merely acknowledged them by their hair color.</p>
<p>The one with the red hair is said to be a daughter of Countess Karina’s nanny, and her right hand. She grew up with Karina from a young age, and as if they were one body, she acted like Karina’s clone. Irvan narrowed his brow as he recalled inappropriate rumors regarding Collin and Karina’s ladies-in-waiting.</p>
<p>“Did I interrupt something?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No, no,” Collin shook his head, his face pale. He stopped eating as soon as he saw Irvan. He cautiously gauged Irvan’s attire. Today, Irvan was wearing casual clothes; there was nothing on his waist and hands. Irvan with a sword was like a dangerous human weapon, but since he was unarmed, Collin felt relieved.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” The nervous Collin was met with Irvan’s sharp gaze.</p>
<p>“May I come in?” Irvan said.</p>
<p>“Uh, that’s – ”</p>
<p>Irvan stared hard at the hesitant Collin and strode into the bedroom anyways. He passed by the bed and stood by the window, looking outside. The inner room was located on the second floor, and Count Van Wert’s castle, like any other ancient castle, had a very high first floor. On the first floor, there was an audience chamber and large banquet hall with huge chandeliers that hung like lotus flowers. Collin felt nervous not knowing the purpose for Irvan’s visit. He stared after his back, and as he stood by the window, he was conflicted on whether to drive out the guest or not.</p>
<p>“Th-” Just as Collin was about to say something, Irvan, who had been looking out the window, turned his head.</p>
<p>“You there,” Irvan started. The maid flinched at his sharp gaze. Irvan stared disapprovingly at the maids and they froze like mice in front of a snake. “Where’s the one with red hair?”</p>
<p>“Yes…?” the maid asked with a confused expression.</p>
<p>“Aren’t there three of you? Where did the other one go?”</p>
<p>The black-haired maid replied promptly. “She is carrying out her duties.”</p>
<p>“What about you two?”</p>
<p>“We….” The ladies-in-waiting seemed to be lost for a moment and mumbled gibberish, looking at each other in askance. Collin interjected, waving his hands.</p>
<p>“Come on, don’t be so scary,” Colling laughed nervously. “As you can see, they were helping me eat.”</p>
<p>“I guess you’re unwell,” Irvan said. Collin remained silent, sweat forming on his temples.</p>
<p>“Did something happen that you need help with eating?” As Irvan’s cold gaze slid to Collin, Collin became tight-lipped. Irvan smirked. Even if he had ten mouths, there would be nothing to say.</p>
<p>Last night’s events were reported by his mole, who had been hanging outside the prison. While Irvan was traveling back to the castle in haste with the horse that Baron Berne had prepared, his mole was watching the dungeon and keeping a close eye on the situation. His mole didn’t know what was going on inside, but he could clearly see who went in and out, and the kind of atmosphere that befall on the dungeons. From his watch, Irvan became aware of the instigator and the culprit behind it</p>
<p>Irvan looked at Collin indifferently with his blue-grey eyes. Then, he opened his mouth and commanded the maids. “Black and blonde hair. Go to the annex now and wait for my next command.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>The two maids looked at Collin before answering. Their actual master was not Irvan, but the Muns brother and sister. Since the Countess, the master, was not around, it was reasonable to follow Collin’s instructions.</p>
<p>As Collin was just standing there blinking, the anxious maids asked again. “Shall we…?”</p>
<p>“Follow the commander’s instructions,” Collin could only say, gulping.</p>
<p>Only then did the maids move out of the room. After all the maids had left, Irvan ordered the servants to leave the room as well. “I have something to share with Mr. Collin, so please leave,” Irvan said.</p>
<p>“What are you going to talk about?” Collin’s direct attendant gathered his courage and asked, but other servants had dark expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>“Should I tell you that?”</p>
<p>“N-No….” The direct servant immediately retreated, but unlike his words, he did not budge.</p>
<p>“I told you to leave.” As Irvan spoke coldly, the servants held their breath and looked at Collin.</p>
<p>“…Sir Collin.”</p>
