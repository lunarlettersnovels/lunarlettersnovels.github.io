            <p><strong>Chapter 14.1</strong></p>
<p>Emma could feel the difference in the muscle strength. It was as easy as breathing for the man while it took her whole strength and effort.</p>
<p>“Th-thank you.”</p>
<p>Recognizing the terrifying presence of the man standing close to her, Emma’s body suddenly froze, and she couldn’t move her mouth, but she managed to warm up her lips to be polite.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.” The man shrugged and turned around. The man’s broad muscles and ripped muscles caught her eyes.</p>
<p><em>I spent the night with a man like this. Fully naked and doing stuff…</em></p>
<p><em>Ughhhh. </em>The more she thought about it, the more she felt ashamed. At the same time, it was frustrating that she was unable to remember anything that might have happened. Emma quickly moved to dry her laundry to calm her confused mind, but she could still feel the man’s presence behind her back.</p>
<p><em>Is he gone? </em>Emma wondered and looked back. Her back and shoulders collided with the man’s chest. Her eyes met his. The man was looking down at her too. Emma in his arms. The man’s blue-grey cold eyes felt uneasy.</p>
<p>It looked as if a red flame was surrounded by a piece of blue ice.</p>
<p>Emma’s face was reflected in the middle of the pupil of his eyes surrounded by blue icy spears for irises. As Emma looked into his eyes, she suddenly felt dizzy. Emma felt like she was being sucked into the dark abyss of his eyes and she felt as though she might fall.</p>
<p>As the man’s piercing gaze gazed at her, Emma could no longer bear it. She shivered and lowered her gaze. As her slender body faltered, the man’s hard touch supported her back. As the man held her in his arms, the pungent smell hit her nose. The sweet scent of alcohol mixed with the man’s body odour was overpowering.</p>
<p><em>Is it because of the alcohol or did his gaze change subtly?</em></p>
<p>“Do you drink a lot?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you drunk”?</p>
<p>“Not really… however….” Emma raised her head at the low voice that fell on her ears like a secret temptation. “I have a question,” he finally said, narrowing his eyes.</p>
<p>“Did Miller send you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p><em>Miller? </em>She didn’t know any Miller. She looked at his lips and blinked in confusion. “Who is Miller?” She swallowed in nervousness. She barely had the courage to ask back.</p>
<p>“You are saying you don’t know Miller?” said the man, tilting his head.</p>
<p>“I don’t. As I have said, I was on my way from Summerville to Polarcille. It is my first time here. I have never met a person called Miller in my entire life.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like a very common name,” she added.</p>
<p>“Then what about Colliner? Have you heard of the name?”</p>
<p>“No.” Emma shook her head firmly.</p>
<p>A strange smile hung around the man’s mouth. At first, it looked like cynicism or a smirk. It felt insulting. Even so, his lips were exquisite. With a smile on it, Emma couldn’t take her eyes off him.</p>
<p><em>How would it have felt when I touched his lips? Warm? Soft? Hot?</em></p>
<p>The body that touched his would remember him, but Emma couldn’t recall anything. As she looked up at the man with dreamy eyes. He continued calmly, “What about Karin? She is also called Karina. Have you heard of her before?”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t know her.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” The man seemed satisfied with the answer. His eyes seemed to smile even more. He looked younger than he was.</p>
<p>“Hm. I am familiar with a lot of scheming plots. This definitely doesn’t sound like theirs.”</p>
<p>Emma’s heart sank listening to him. <em>Scheming? What does he mean? Am I being suspected of something? </em>She looked up at the man. His smile was full but twisted. She decided to stand up for herself instead of being a passive observer.</p>
<p>“Hey! There must have been a mistake. The name of the nanny who betrayed me was Dora. I know of no woman by the name of Karin. I have three friends at Summerville by the name of Becca, Sally and Micelle. Those are the only women I know.”</p>
<p>When Emma firmly clarified herself, the corners of his mouth quirked up even more. It felt as though he was dealing with a child’s chatter. It was annoying but his smile was so dazzling that Emma seemed transfixed.</p>
