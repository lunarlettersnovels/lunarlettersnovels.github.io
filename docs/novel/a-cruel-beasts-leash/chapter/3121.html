            <p><strong>Chapter 28.1</strong></p>
<p>“Wow,” he remarked, gazing at her nectar adoringly. “I want to taste it.” His gaze turned deeper. “Should I start now?”</p>
<p>Emma bit her bottom lip. Face flushed, she didn’t know where to shift her eyes. Fortunately, there was a knock from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>“Master Irvan.” Miller hesitantly asked from outside, “May I enter?”</p>
<p>Irvan released Emma, an annoyed look on his face as he pushed towards the bathroom door, closing it behind him with more force than necessary. Emma released the breath she didn’t realize she had been holding.</p>
<p>Now… she felt like she had to scrub the fire out every inch of her body.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The annex next to the pond was miniscule in size to the castle, but it was a separate two-story building with everything Emma needed. When she went and looked around herself, she found the place clean as Irvan had instructed.</p>
<p>Emma stood in front of the arched staircase with a puzzled look on her face, scanning the ceiling to the floor. Was it because Irvan was a nobleman? Even the annex, which should be detached from the castle, was much more extravagant than the main building.</p>
<p>Although it lacked the majestic style of the main building, the interior was furnished in polished, white marble with gold-rimmed edges. It was akin to a villa hidden deep inside the garden.</p>
<p>Like any residential building, the first floor had a main staircase and some small rooms; the second floor was the living space.</p>
<p>Irvan, who had finally returned, merely said to the servants: “Make sure no one comes in until I say so.”</p>
<p>When the servants left the premises under Irvan’s order, only he and Emma were left inside. The entire place became quiet and still, at the center of the long space warmed by golden sunlight, the couple’s eyes met. Her cheeks aflame, Emma broke the eye contact first, unable to look at the burning desire for her, reflected in his blue-gray eyes. It felt like she was getting an intimate caress from the look in his eyes alone.</p>
<p>Why did she think of him as heartless? She could see now how his eyes were like two blue burning flames.</p>
<p>The heat inside her that had barely subsided after washing from awhile ago, slowly flickered to life, until it was consciously swirling under her belly button. <em>Thump. Thump. </em>With his strong, undeniable presence standing beside her, her heart trembled against her chest. Then, she could feel herself getting wet again.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about?” he whispered lowly, regarding her with a deep gaze.</p>
<p>“N-nothing,” Emma stuttured.</p>
<p>“Hmm..” Irvan chuckled. “You aren’t thinking of anything er*tic? From the look in your eyes along, I can sense the l*st.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not.”</p>
<p>Emma felt a shameful sting inside her; Irvan was right. A sudden bout of nervousness washed upon her – how was she so attracted to this man to the point she constantly sought for the irresistible pleasure he gave? Emma decided to change the topic.</p>
<p>Coughing awkwardly, Emma tried to break the awkward mood, saying, “I think I should have used an alias.”</p>
<p>“How come?” He kept his eyes on her after a faint smile appeared on his handsome face. His eyes never left her face, and Emma could feel the familiar flush creep up her cheeks.</p>
<p>She fixed her eyes over his head as if avoiding his gaze. “…they might not give up,”</p>
<p>“They?” Irvan asked curiously.</p>
<p>“The traitors.”</p>
<p>Emma recalled Otto and Dora, who may still be alive, and she shuddered without realizing it.</p>
<p>Irvan narrowed his eyes. “Hey. It’s all right. We’re safe inside the castle. Anyway, they’ll find out soon enough even if you use an alias. Since it’s not common for a pretty lady from Summerville to be here,” he said calmly.</p>
<p>His voice rang pleasantly through her ears, and Emma could feel her gradually subside.</p>
<p>“They could already be talking about you since you’re so beautiful.”</p>
<p>When Irvan bluntly gave her a sudden compliment, Emma’s face which had eased, quickly heated up again like a tomato.</p>
<p>“I guess you are used to receiving compliments.” He smiled mischieviously, lowering himself to meet her gaze.</p>
<p>“I guess you are generous with compliments. Irvan, Sir,” Emma said sulkily.</p>
<p>Irvan burst into laughter, finding Emma adorable. “That’s because I’ve never met such a beautiful woman. Wait. Am I the only one who thinks you’re pretty?” he said.</p>
<p>With a gentle swipe of his finger, he placed the stray lock that had fallen over her cheek behind her ear.</p>
<p>“Anyway, rumors have spread that I cherish you dearly. Everyone would have known it by now. So…” All of a sudden, he reached out and lifted her. “Let’s do as the rumors say.”</p>
<p>His long legs briskly took them up the staircase, towards the center room. The next moment, as they were inside barely even reaching the bed by the window, Irvan planted a deep kiss on Emma’s lips.</p>
