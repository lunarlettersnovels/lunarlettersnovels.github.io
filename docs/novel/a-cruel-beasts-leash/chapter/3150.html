<p><strong>Chapter 13.1</strong></p>
<p>As the cold and chilly air gradually warmed up, Emma, who was huddling inside the shirt, poked her head out. She looked at the wide back of the man looking at the flame, hesitated, and put her shirt on her body.</p>
<p>The man made a fire in the fireplace after taking a shower. His movement was as quick and graceful as a flowing water.</p>
<p><em>‘Well, since he works as a cabin keeper, lighting a fireplace would be simple for him.’</em></p>
<p>The dry firewood that was piled up started to emit smoke. The fireplace blazed up with a scarlet glow when the man tossed in a few huge logs to start a little fire. Warmth spread swiftly into the frigid chamber, probably due to the burning fire.</p>
<p>Emma, who had been hiding away under the shirt, poked her head out as the frigid and icy air gradually warmed up, and looked at the man’s wide back as he stared at the flame. She hesitated before putting her shirt on her body.</p>
<p>Her head felt like it was ready to break from the hangover, but she carefully balanced herself and wandered away from the sofa, her shirt falling to her knees. The shirt appeared to be suited to the man’s height, while it looked like a loose oversized garment on her.</p>
<p>She tucked her shirt into a tight knot and picked up the dirty clothing that was folded on the floor. There was also a fire, so she could avoid appearing like a beggar if she washed, dried, and put it back on.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” Emma said nervously as she walked to the bathroom, her clothes in her arms, as if she’s running away.</p>
<p>Her heart began to pound frantically as soon as she entered the wet bathroom and shut the door. She barely leaned against the wall and stared blankly into space for a few moments before collapsing.</p>
<p><em>‘I spent a night with that guy?</em>’ Emma shook her head. It seemed impossible, but it was evident that it was true. She wouldn’t have been naked in that man’s arms otherwise.</p>
<p><em>‘Ahhhhhh!’</em> Her mind was aching with confusion as she realized the inescapable truth. She wanted to scream and shout, but she knew she couldn’t because of the situation. Emma muffled her voice and covered her mouth with both hands.</p>
<p>She clenched her lips and took a deep breath. She calmed her tense thought by punching her stuffy chest three or four times. She couldn’t come up with any solutions to this problem, and her mind was utterly blank.</p>
<p>Furthermore, she felt as though she was going insane because she had no memory of drinking. Her ankles trembled and her head throbbed, but she knew she couldn’t stay in this position long.</p>
<p><em>‘Clothes! I need clothes,’ </em>she said to herself.</p>
<p>When she finally pulled herself together and approached the bathtub, she noticed the water spilled all over the place, most likely from the man’s shower. Suddenly, there was a pleasant scent coming from somewhere. Emma sniffed and was drawn by the smell. It seemed to come from the soap on the shelf when she followed the solid line of perfume that was plainly present. The ivory-colored square soap had a smell that was almost identical to that of the man’s body earlier.</p>
<p>When Emma remembered how she was naturally caught up in the man’s arms while roaming in her sleep, her face flushed.</p>
<p>“Ugh!” Shaking her head and moving her body to clear her mind of the disturbing thoughts.</p>
<p><em>‘First, laundry.’ </em>she stated.</p>
<p>When she poured clear water on her dirty clothes on the floor, a pool of muddy black water formed. She even felt pitiful for dressing in such filthy rags. She felt uncomfortable as the water became muddier as she poured more. As the dirt on the fabric faded, the dirty water went down the drain with it.</p>
<p>For a long period, Emma engaged herself to cleaning dirt. Then she realized, much too late, how selfish her acts had been. There was still plenty of water in the large bucket, but it was not from a spring. Most likely, the man had to transport the water from another location. Emma felt she couldn’t waste it like that.</p>
<p><em>‘I should be considerate,’</em> she said.</p>
<p>She gently folded the shirt on a shelf, concerned that it would become wet and poured water into the bathtub.</p>
<p>After washing the clothes, she knew that she could never wear the silk dress again because the outside was already torn. Fortunately, the undergarment worn inside was in decent shape, so it appeared that the garment’s function might be restored by gently cleaning and hemming it. It would, however, only be used to cover her body.</p>
<p><em>‘I should try to borrow at least an outer robe when I go out.’ </em>She sighed.</p>
<p>She tucked the damaged silk garment aside and washed the underwear, wringing off the excess water. She rapidly cleansed her body after that.</p>
