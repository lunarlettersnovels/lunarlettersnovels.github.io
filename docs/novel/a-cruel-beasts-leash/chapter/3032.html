            <p><strong>Chapter 72.2</strong></p>
<p>“It keeps chewing me. It still isn’t enough?”</p>
<p>He murmured with a devious grin. His hot cream and her nectar mixed together inside forming a decadent pleasure; Emma felt that her entire body was boiling.</p>
<p>“…. Ahh… no. It’s tasty…”</p>
<p>Emma let out a m*an. She didn’t care what she was saying. It was beyond pleasurable. She didn’t want to let go of thick p*nis. She didn’t want him to stop.</p>
<p>“Then I should feed you more.”</p>
<p>Irvan whispered and switched her over so that her sensitive br*asts were rubbing against the soft sheets. Her petals were greeted by cold air and liquid continued to spill out from it slowly. Irvan caressed her smooth b*tt*cks, and positioned his length at the entrance of her cave. He slid inside her with one smooth movement, going all the way in.</p>
<p>Emma m*aned and her hands clasped the sheets for support. Their combined juices made them wet and hot. It felt like they were going to melt from the heat and pleasure at any second. Irvan mindlessly drove in and outside her. Each time, hiss thick p*nis increased in speed. In reply, Emma’s back curved, her bottom spread to accommodate him.</p>
<p>Was it even acceptable to feel this kind of pleasure?</p>
<p>Emma tried to muffle her voice. Her mind went blank and became empty a few times. But the pleasure that kept on washing over her didn’t stop. Emma only felt heat as the org*asms came. Irvan kept on going many times until the sun started to rise.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day, Emma woke up late afternoon. She let out a sigh from fatigue, and then blinked in surprise. A rumor had spread inside the castle.</p>
<p>“They committed suicide together?” she said again.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>What Jenna told her was shocking. Karina Muns summoned Bishop Albert because she wanted to repent for her sins. All of the sudden, and reasons unknown, she ended her life with the maid that was serving her.</p>
<p>“…. She didn’t seem like the person to do that,” Emma said.</p>
<p>“We don’t know for sure. People say suicide is contagious. They were twins after all,” Jenna replied.</p>
<p>It was true that Karina and Collin were twins, but Collin didn’t commit suicide… If he did, then Irvan wouldn’t have made the maids that were bribed to tell specific stories of how he died in the trial.</p>
<p>Also, vice-captain Roham had also planned that if the maids were going to have an abortion, then they could drink abortion medicine in the trial. Although the maids hesitated for a moment, they took the medicine in the end. They even seemed satisfied that it was forced upon them as their pregnancy wasn’t their choice… The result was an immense amount of bleeding. Thanks to such cruel planning, the trial became chaotic.</p>
<p>After the trial that shook the Van Wert castle, the maids left the castle with a good amount of money. They said they’ll go to the capital secretly and never come back.</p>
<p><em>‘Countess Karina and that red-haired maid both killed themselves?’</em></p>
<p>Emma felt suspicious. They were both hard to deal with.. but the evidence that was there showed that it was suicide. Karina left a will with her blood. She let her maid stab her first before the maid ended her life  after.</p>
<p>“…. Really?”</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe it, but she had no choice. Emma was trying to brush it off as Jenna gave her a cup of tea.</p>
<p>“Ah, there’s another piece of news.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>As Emma looked curious, Jenna quickly grabbed the tea cup as it was about to spill. “Careful. It’s hot,” she warned.</p>
<p>“Ah, okay…” Emma nodded and quickly fixed her posture.</p>
<p>“To tell you the truth, the whole castle is a mess because of this news,” Jenna started again.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Estate war.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>As Emma asked, Jenna told her what happened while Emma was asleep. Irvan summoned his subjects this morning and declared that Karina Muns killed herself without taking any responsibility, so he’s going to declare an estate war against the Muns and hold them responsible.</p>
<p>Emma realized this was his real reason why he said not to send a quick letter to the palace last night.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Irvan was very busy with Count Liman’s funeral and the preparation for the estate war. He also had to take care of the business as the owner of the estate. Emma was there in the meetings he attended; While Irvan was taking care of the estate business, Emma sat right below him, watching him.</p>
<p>In the beginning, a few subjects were a bit taken aback with her presence, but Irvan ignored their complaints. Since Baron Berne treated her with respect, they all grudgingly accepted her presence in the meetings.</p>
