            <p><strong>Chapter 78.1</strong></p>
<p>When Emma leaned forward, revealing her neck, Irvan tilted his head and kissed a long line from her chin to her collarbone. Then, he playfully nibbled on the hem of her dress around her breast with his front teeth and tore it apart.</p>
<p>“You are so beautiful, Emma,” he said.</p>
<p>As her breasts were exposed and her nipples stiffened, Irvan eagerly lowered his head.</p>
<p>“My pure and chaste bride,” he whispered against her skin.</p>
<p>He softly kissed her nipples, drawing them into his warm mouth. Emma watched him through darkened eyes as he explored her body with his tongue.</p>
<p>“You like being teased like this,” he said with a mischievous grin.</p>
<p>Thrilling pleasure spread through her chest and into her heart, making her gasp.</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>His tongue moved powerfully to tease her nipples and tingling pleasure wrapped around her body.</p>
<p>“Despite being so naughty,” he said, savoring the taste of her skin.</p>
<p>He slobbered on her breasts with sweet saliva and wrapped his tongue around her nipples. He held Emma by the waist and pulled her close.</p>
<p>“You are absolutely stunning,” he said with a smile.</p>
<p>Emma m*aned as her lower region clenched, and she was overwhelmed with sensations.</p>
<p>He pummeled her relentlessly, suffocating her with each forceful thrust.</p>
<p><em>Thwop, thwop.</em></p>
<p>Each time he penetrated her, a thick flow of fluids gushed forth, drenching his thick member as she writhed in ecstasy.</p>
<p>“I can’t help but get excited like a rutting beast,” he said, his voice tinged with desperation.</p>
<p>She surrendered herself to him, taking him in deeply, her folds spreading wide to accommodate his thick length and spewing out sticky fluids as she lost herself in the sensation.</p>
<p><em>Thump, thump.</em></p>
<p>Her lower regions, which had been clenching tightly as if a stake had been driven into her, were now being pummeled by his hard length.</p>
<p>“Hm? Emma, ha…” he groaned, lost in the moment.</p>
<p>Fluids spilled out where skin met skin, and she felt as if she was falling into an endless abyss of pleasure.</p>
<p>“Hu, huu…” she moaned, unable to contain the sensations that were overwhelming her.</p>
<p>Feeling the heat and the excitement, she was dizzy, and her eyes burned with desire.</p>
<p>“Don’t come,” he said, barely able to hold himself back.</p>
<p>“Hnggg,” she gasped, her body shuddering with pleasure.</p>
<p>Emma quivered as he gave her the hard pleasure that she craved with each powerful thrust.</p>
<p>“How could you come alone?” he asked, his voice thick with need.</p>
<p>Could this really be happening?</p>
<p>“Do you think I would let you climax alone?” he growled, his movements becoming more forceful by the second.</p>
<p>“Haa!” she cried out, unable to hold back any longer.</p>
<p>As he continued to pound her relentlessly, she felt a sharp sensation rise to the top of her head, signaling the start of her climax.</p>
<p>She was consumed by the sensations coursing through her body, unable to think of anything else as pleasure flooded her senses.</p>
<p>He continued pounding her mercilessly, driving her towards the deep pleasure that awaited her.</p>
<p>Could it really feel this good?</p>
<p>At that moment, when her insides felt like they were boiling with heat, she quivered, feeling a distant pleasure building within her before it exploded into a raging climax.</p>
<p>“Ugh, hold on. Just a little more.”</p>
<p>“Hu, uh, ngh!”</p>
<p>Her vision flickered as the pleasure overtook her, leaving her panting and moaning uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Her tight walls clamped down tightly around him, squeezing him relentlessly.</p>
<p>“Just a little more, ahh.”</p>
<p>Her walls began to contract greedily, drawing him deeper inside. Unable to withstand the pressure, his hard length swelled up and finally erupted in a powerful explosion.</p>
<p>“Ah, ahh…”</p>
<p>Irvan let out a low moan as his body trembled with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Hnggg!”</p>
<p>Emma was out of her mind with pleasure, her moans becoming increasingly difficult to control.</p>
<p>As he continued to thrust into her, his penis trembling within her tight heat, she was consumed by the suffocating pleasure of her climax.</p>
<p>“Hng, hng.”</p>
<p>“Hng, ah, ahh…”</p>
<p>Emma felt like she was melting under Irvan’s touch. Her body was drenched in sticky fluids, and she trembled with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Phew, we finally had our first night in the bridal room,” Irvan said, savoring the moment.</p>
<p>Once he had finished ejaculating, Irvan moved himself back and forth slowly to prolong the ecstasy.</p>
<p>“However, it won’t be good to have just one child,” he mused.</p>
<p>As he spoke, his hard penis wriggled against her walls, mixing their bodily fluids together.</p>
<p>Emma looked up at Irvan, her eyes hazy with pleasure. She was drunk on the sensations coursing through her body, and Irvan was the most radiant thing in her world.</p>
<p>“In order to fulfill everyone’s wishes, I think it’s better to have the first night as long as possible,” Irvan whispered lewdly, pulling Emma close.</p>
<p><em>Squeak, squeak.</em></p>
<p>As they began to move together again, Emma’s walls trembled with heat and pleasure.</p>
<p>“Hold me, Emma,” Irvan said urgently.</p>
<p>“Hng, ngg, hng…” Emma moaned as he thrust into her once again, her body shaking with each movement.</p>
<p>“Hold on tight,” Irvan said, his voice rough with desire.</p>
<p>Emma clung to him desperately as he pounded into her, sweat dripping down her body.</p>
<p>“Like this, hold me like I’m a dog running rampant,” he growled.</p>
<p>She felt dizzy with pleasure and desire.</p>
<p>“Become mine and never let go,” he whispered, his movements growing more intense with each passing moment.</p>
