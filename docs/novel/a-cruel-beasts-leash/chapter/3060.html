            <p><strong>Chapter 58.2</strong></p>
<p>“Don’t come near me! Where are you going to put that little thing?!” she screamed at him. Contrary to his overly confident attitude, Cleve’s member was not big. At most, it would be as thick and long as two fingers.</p>
<p>“Small?” Cleve laughed, “Men, she said mine is small.” As Cleve spoke with confidence, the knights next to him laughed without answering much.</p>
<p>“It’s small! It’s the size of a rotten mushroom!”</p>
<p>Cleve’s eyes gleamed as Emma viciously screamed. “Are you going to make a review now? You are very reckless. Let’s see if you say that after tasting my c*ck.”</p>
<p>Cleve approached her. It was disgusting to see its infected appearance as if he had had a skin disease. The epidermis was terribly wrinkled, and his entire length oozed with yellow puss with some of them having crusted over. Emma shuddered and vomited. It wasn’t just a skin disease. If he had such terrible anatomical symptoms, he probably had a s*x*ally transmitted disease. She just wanted to bite her tongue and die. Everyone frowned as Emma vomited before them.</p>
<p>“No can do. Should I gag you before something happens?” Clevelowered himself and made an eye gesture to the knights. Perhaps because of being experienced with this type of doing, one of the knights directly shoved a dirty handkerchief into Emma’s mouth.</p>
<p>“I’m going inside now… embrace this big c*ck that has devoured all the Reshire’s prostitutes. You’ll see heaven as soon as it touches your hole.”  Cleve lowered himself and aimed his member between Emma’s legs.</p>
<p>“Aaahh!”</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>“H-Hel-”</p>
<p>Suddenly, screams were heard from outside the prison, and the door powerfully burst open. At the same time, a sharp sword ripped through the room like a cold gust of wind.</p>
<p>“Wha-what…!” Cleve’s head turned a bit, and in the next second, hot blood was pouring down on Emma’s body. She couldn’t even blink her eyes as a black sword sharply cut through the air. The necks of those who were holding her captive were all cut off and fell to the floor of the prison. She was free at last.</p>
<p>“Are you all right?”</p>
<p>Her eyes glanced at Irvan, who was breathing deeply in unrestrained anger. Emma opened her mouth, but found no words to say. She closed her eyes tightly and opened them again.</p>
<p>“Emma,” Irvan said, a solem look on his face. “Are you all right?”</p>
<p>Emma felt her eyes burn. “I’m o-okay,” she mumbled weakly. She tested moving her wrists, then slowly heaved her body up.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all the men who had arrested Emma had turned into pieces of meat that had been cut in two. From the terrifyingly clean cuts, bright red blood flowed down like a river and wet the floor.</p>
<p>“Can you stand up?” Irvan asked.</p>
<p>Emma felt like she was dreaming. “Yes…” she answered.</p>
<p>She managed to get off the floor with Irvan’s help. As soon as she was near himt, Irvan hugged her tightly. Even though she was trembling, and finally held in familiar, strong and warm arms, she felt dazed and her mind was blank.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s too quiet.’ </em>Emma tried to get her bearings looked around. She finally realized the reason for the silence. It was as if a storm had swept away and left only corpses in its wake. Her ankles trembled like jelly as she looked at the people who had been cut into pieces. She felt dizzy and staggered. Irvan instantly grabbed Emma and steadied her in his wide arms.</p>
<p>“H-How…” She took a deep breath and slowly lifted her head to see a handsome face completely out of sync with the horrific surroundings.</p>
<p>“Baron Berne informed me. I ran straight through the night,” was his prompt answer.</p>
<p>Emma was relieved to hear his pleasant, low tone that sweetly wrapped her ears. She closed her trembling eyelids and opened them again. This was <em>not</em> a dream. Indeed, Irvan had appeared and saved her. Irvan saved her, again! Tremendous relief flooded in and melted Emma’s anxious heart.</p>
<p>“Emma, can you walk?” Irvan asked anxiously.</p>
<p>“…Yes.” Emma nodded and answered, but Irvan lifted her up regardless. As he carried Emma in his arms, he began to walk out of the prison door. There were bodies all over the door until the hallway. Not a single one was alive. There was no sound of breathing, and only dark, red blood flowed down the floor. There was no end to the bloody corpses as they continued on.</p>
<p><em>‘One, two, three….’ </em>Emma silently bit her lip and counted the number of heads. She gave up when the number reached twenty. It was as if a grim reaper had held the festival. Not a single one of the soldiers who were down in the dungeon survived.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, now. Don’t tremble anymore.”</p>
