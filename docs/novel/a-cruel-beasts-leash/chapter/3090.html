            <p><strong>Chapter 43.2</strong></p>
<p>“Ah… Mmmm…” Emma mumbled. They kissed deeply. Emma calmly closed her eyes and gave herself up to Irvan.</p>
<p>“I knew kissing wouldn’t be enough.”</p>
<p>Irvan’s strong arms skillfully went around Emma’s waist and traveled under her skirt. His long, callused fingers groped her soft thighs, her bottom and  went straight to her garden. As Emma m*aned, he rummaged through her knickers, parted it aside to touch the opening, and rubbed it.</p>
<p>He slowly stuck his middle finger deep inside her wet flesh, earning a gasp from Emma.</p>
<p>“I’ll rub some ointment here if it hurts here like last time,” he said.</p>
<p>“…it isn’t an ointment for rubbing <em>there</em>.”</p>
<p>Irvan laughed as the hazy look in Emma’s face turned serious, her brows scrunched as she muttered this.</p>
<p>“Then should I rub something else on it… ?” he whispered. His finger rubbed slowly against her inner walls spreading her liquid inside.</p>
<p>Emma gasped, and held on to Irvan. “Ohh…”</p>
<p>“How is it? Aren’t you curious what I’ll rub on it.?”</p>
<p>“… I’m shy.”</p>
<p>“You must have thought of something really naughty that I don’t know about.”</p>
<p>Emma shuddered at Irvan’s husky murmur, and as one of Irvan’s hands pressed her sensitive clit*ris and the other smoothed her mounds like he was kneading dough. His voice sounded good and sens*al to her ears, it was like another caress on its own.</p>
<p>“Soaked up in such lewdness,” he whispered. “What on earth are you thinking about, Miss Heman?”</p>
<p>“Ahh..”</p>
<p>Irvan wrapped his palm concavely around her womanhood and caressed it slowly.</p>
<p>“I wonder if you’re imagining eating something with your lips down there.”</p>
<p>As his fingers swirled around her inner walls, Emma’s body bent sharply and a light m*an flowed from her lips. It was as if Irvan played her like a pleasure instrument with his hands.  Emma’s inner walls tightened as they matched the rhythm of the finger. Each time it did, her garden crushed against his palm, hot liquid flowed down like fruit juice with a thick scent like a crushed peach.</p>
<p>“So sticky; it feels good,” Irvan mumbled, hugging Emma closer.</p>
<p>“Mmm… yeah…”</p>
<p>“So hot and slippery.”</p>
<p>A light m*an broke through Emma’s open lips. Her slender neck trembled faintly, and she shuddered as her lower body continued to melt and drip from the pleasure that stretched like a stem from her bottom to her spine.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>A loud persistent knock at the door let them know that an uninvited guest had arrived. Emma’s mental state, which was blurred by pleasure, was awakened.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The loud knocking broke the atmosphere inside.</p>
<p>“…shouldn’t we get going?” Emma asked breathily.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” the annoyed Irvan mumbled this as he bent down and softly bit Emma’s peaks. Still, the knocking didn’t stop. “If he is like this every time, I’ll have to get rid of that knocker in the morning…”</p>
<p>Emma scanned the room with squinted eyes as Irvan sucked on her n*pple. She didn’t know how fortunate she was that the annex was surrounded by a pond. Though the air was a bit humid, it was very safe from prying eyes outside. Even if impatient visitors wanted to look inside, the distance from the open windows to the pond was quite far, and even that was obscured by the thin lace curtains.</p>
<p>“Master!”</p>
<p>She’d wondered when the impatient knocking would stop, but then a deep voice echoed through the space.</p>
<p>“It’s me, sir! Roham!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the urgent voice calling Irvan this time was familiar to her.</p>
<p>“… it’s vice-commander Roham.”</p>
<p>As Emma sighed and muttered, Irvan frowned irritably, sucked the juice off his fingers, tasting them, then smacked his lips with regret.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, sir.”</p>
<p>When Emma pushed his chest away with her palms, he let out a sigh of annoyance as he straightened his body.</p>
<p>“It may be urgent, Irvan,” Emma reasoned.</p>
<p>“I’m the one who’s urgent.”</p>
<p>Roham was the close aide who had stopped Irvan’s rampage at the dinner last night; the vice-commander of the Black Knight Order. He was as rugged and stout as his loud knock and voice, so if Irvan were to ignore him, he might tear off the front door and break-in, uninvited.</p>
<p>“Irvan-”</p>
<p>“I know. I know.”</p>
<p>While Emma was holding her disheveled clothing up, Irvan, sighing, stomped toward the door with his shoulders squared. When he opened the door in an annoyed manner, Roham yelled right away as if he’d been waiting.</p>
<p>“It is said that monsters have emerged again in Lojak,” Roham immediately cut to the chase, with no flowery greetings whatsoever.</p>
<p>“What are we, their pet dogs?” Irvan snarked. “Giving us these d*mn orders. Tell Edner to take care of everything this time!”</p>
<p>When Irvan crossed his arms firmly with a thunderous face, Roham shook his head as if it was an impossible request.</p>
<p>“I cannot, sir.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“It’s the same region of Lojak, but this time it’s on the west side. So our side of the territory was heavily attacked. The messenger says that monsters have been pouring in like a rat infestation since last night. A wave of monsters cannot be resolved by a vigilante group. We must move immediately.”</p>
<p>“Sh*t.” Irvan despondently looked to the sky with an anguished face. Then he let out one loud sigh. “There are times when I want refuse to go out and slay monsters.”</p>
<p>“…I know, sir,” Roham said. “But it’s something we must live with for a long time.”</p>
