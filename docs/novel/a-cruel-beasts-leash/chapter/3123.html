            <p><strong>Chapter 27.1</strong></p>
<p>Even though she had turned him down, Irvan merely smiled, not backing down. However, the servants could burst in at any minute to let them know that the annex was ready; it surely wasn’t the time, nor the appropriate place to argue with Irvan.</p>
<p>Emma took a deep breath. Left with no choice, she proceeded to get out of the bathtub. Drip. Drop. As she stood in front of him with water dripping from her n*de body, his eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>The towel hung wide-open from his arms, as if welcoming her. “Come over here,” he gestured for her.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Emma sulkily stood in the middle of the towel, her cheeks burning.</p>
<p>“You’re beautiful,” Irvan suddenly blurted out, his low voice a gentle caress to her ears. Emma bit her lips, keeping her eyes straight.</p>
<p>“My, how shy you are.” He wrapped the towel around her and with skillful hands, gently tapped down the moisture from her skin. “You smell good,” he remarked.</p>
<p>“… It’s scented soap. It smells nice,” she answered.</p>
<p>Irvan stood behind Emma, slightly tilting his head to press his nose against the nape of her neck. He inhaled her scent greedily. Caught unawares by the sudden contact, Emma felt a thrill run from the top to the bottom of her spine.</p>
<p>“It’s not that smell. I mean your own scent, Emma.” After savoring the scent of her body for a long time, he shook his head slowly. “Is that the smell of flesh? It strangely smells great.”</p>
<p>As if to confirm what he just said, he deeply inhaled Emma’s skin again, bringing her closer to him. At that moment, something warm touched Emma’s ear. She wondered if it was his breath lightly tickling her earlobe, but then his lips lowered from her ear to her neckline, and to the back of her slender neck. Emma trembled as Irvan licked her skin with his moist tongue, and then, unbeknownst to her, he raised his front teeth and sucked her supple, skin.</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>A m*an coquettishly burst out from her. Far from pain, a dizzying sensation spread from the point of contact to the rest of her body. Even if it was th simple act of teasing her neck, she felt his actions far too stimulating. Everytime, Irvan succeeded in making her experience l*st.</p>
<p>He continued his ministrations on her skin, Sscking, nibbling, licking. And she, an almost undone mess at his mercy, legs twitching and m*ans flowing freely from her lips.</p>
<p>“Ah! Yes!” Her eyes hazily lifted to the ceiling.</p>
<p>It was only two days since they last laid with each other. By now, she thought she would have been used to his touch. And yet.. the upcoming pleasure served to thrill her body in expecetation, her senses keen to his every touch.</p>
<p>Heat pooled at her belly, and her bottom twisted unconsciously against him in eagerness. “Ohhh! Ah!”</p>
<p>Soon after, his hands navigated to her waist and towards her swollen bre*sts. Emma bent her body as another m*an escaped from her mouth.</p>
<p>“Hush,” he silkilly whispered.“There many eyes surrounding us, many ears listening.”</p>
<p>It was a sharp warning that should have ceased their sensual interactions, but he did not stop his actions of coveting her body. His two large hands cupped her chest, and her hard, pink peaks were trapped by his fingers. Irvan applied pressure to his fingers and played them like a fiddle until they rose, sensitive to his touch.</p>
<p>The enveloping feeling Emma felt as her soft flesh was pressed against Irvan’s hands and her peaks rolled aginst his hard fingers was unbearably sensu*l. Switching places that now he was in front and below her, he began to lick the her sensitive buds on her plump, white mounds.</p>
<p>“Yes! Oh!” Emma m*aned.</p>
<p>He pulled out his tongue soaked with saliva, and lightly licked the tip of her red peaks. His tongue brushed against it, swirled around it, and sucked it deep into his warm mouth as if her were swallowing a delicious, juicy fruit.</p>
<p>Every time he sucked, blood loudly pounded against Emma’s ears. When his soft tongue gently pleased her sensitive peaks, pleasure shot up from her ankles to the back of her head. Then, heat deliciously began to swirl at the middle of her thighs. He quickly sucked in the entire are*la and soon captured only her n*pple, gently twisting it around his teeth.</p>
<p>“Mmmh!”</p>
<p>Emma’s body, unable to withstand the pleasure that had come over her, flinched and shook. With Irvan’s grip, she was able to remain standing, but the garden at the middle of her legs had become unbearably hot and aching.</p>
<p>Emma’s cheeks turned crimson. With every wet caress from his tongue, it seemed as if her petals were being soaked.</p>
