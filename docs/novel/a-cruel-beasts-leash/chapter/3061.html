            <p><strong>Chapter 58.1</strong></p>
<p>Cleve gestured to the soldier guarding the prison door to pick up items on the floor and deliver them to the doctor. As the soldier who had been glancing at Emma’s exposed legs bent down and gathered all her things, Cleve placed his hand on his shoulder and smiled.</p>
<p>“Hurry up and deliver it, then come back down. After we are done with our business, you will have your turn as well.”</p>
<p>“T-Thank you!”</p>
<p>The soldier bowed his head and ran out of the prison door. As if Cleve’s words were transmitted through the other soldiers, cheers like thunder erupted from the outside. If anyone heard it, they would mistake it for the sound of a festival.</p>
<p>“Now then, thornless Miss Herman,” Cleve laughed at his pun then looked down at Emma with hazy eyes.</p>
<p>She was relieved for nothing. She had defeated Collin, but Cleve had appeared like a vicious ambush. An unbearable disgust and hatred crept up.</p>
<p>“LET GO! LET GO!” Emma screamed until her voice turned sore. She struggled with all her strength, but to no avail. The knights held her firmly on both sides so she couldn’t move. “Do you think Irvan would forgive you?!” she threatened.</p>
<p>Cleve shrugged his shoulders and laughed. “Ahh… your voice is good. Let’s hear how loud it will be. Who knows? Will you scream and m*an like a cat in a rut?!” As Cleve’s thin lips lifted up crookedly, the knight next to him mockingly laughed and added: “During heat, female cats mate with many males! It’s a perfect situation for our Miss Herman. As you go through this guy and the next one, having a melodious voice is a good thing.”</p>
<p>A cold chill ran down Emma’s spine. <em>‘E-Even the soldiers…’ </em>She refused to believe it at first, but her fears were true. As she remembered Cleve’s words to the soldier, a great fear that was difficult to bear came flooding in. Emma glanced down at the floor and struggled aimlessly. She was beyond scared; being helpless and being at the mercy of ruthless people gave her great fear. As Emma was trembling, the greedy gazes inside the prison swallowed her whole.</p>
<p>Cleve chuckled. “I guess you understand the situation now?” He stroked Emma’s chin, grabbed her hair hard and lifted it up.</p>
<p>“Miss Herman!”</p>
<p>“Ugh!” Her anxious heart trembled and began to beat violently. Her head, which hurt since before, pounded to the point that it was going to break. ‘<em>I would rather have fainted or even died than suffer these terrible things!’</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, her nightmare continued. “You have a pretty face. Let’s see how long you can act arrogant…”</p>
<p>A rough hand caressed Emma’s neck and collarbone, then suddenly grabbed the front of her dress. Her dress was torn apart, revealing the underwear covering the chest. It barely covered her breasts, the outline underneath was visible through the sheer material.</p>
<p>“Hoo,” the knight whistled. “You have full t*ts! Enough for two men to suck from both sides. Right?”</p>
<p>The two other knights quickly answered. “No, Sir Cleve must go first.”</p>
<p>Cleve chuckled, apparently satisfied. He lifted Emma’s torn skirt and grabbed her tightly clamped legs, forcing them apart. He began groping her thighs.</p>
<p>“No… I’m not such a petty person. It’s torture to make you wait your turn, so I’ll let you massage these as much as you want while I’m doing it,” he said to the knights. “You must be excited, your nipples are hard,” Cleve said hoarsely.</p>
<p>When he was met by Emma’s sharp gaze, he grinned and said, “Ah, it wouldn’t be that bad, Miss Herman. As long as you keep your mouth shut, you will still proudly take the seat next to Mr. Irvan.”</p>
<p>“What…?” Emma asked.</p>
<p>Cleve started taking off his pants and continued speaking to Emma. “A person of high status wants Miss Herman to marry Mr. Irvan,” he divulged. “The bottom line is, it doesn’t matter whose bloodline the child is born with. You just have to get pregnant and give birth to a boy.”</p>
<p>After he was done speaking, Cleve straightened his shoulders and proudly showed his erect member which showed signs of disease.</p>
<p>“If your head doesn’t work well, then just understand this: It doesn’t matter even if a hundred c*cks are thrusted into a hole in heat. I only have to ensure that a male will be born. It’s very simple, right?”</p>
<p>Cleve pulled down his pants and approached Emma. Knights who grabbed Emma shoved her down to the floor.</p>
<p>“ARGH! GET OFF ME! STOP!” Emma kicked and struggled.</p>
<p>“I need two soldiers from the outside.” As soon as Cleve gave the instructions, the soldiers came running and grabbed Emma’s legs. They pressed her down the cold, dirty floor.</p>
<p>“N-No! Don’t come near me!”</p>
<p>Cleve stood tall between Emma’s open legs and showed off his infected member. Emma was terrified; she wanted to shut her eyes tightly and try to ignore everything, but she opened them instead. Even to the last breath, she would be firm.</p>
