            <p><b>Chapter 5.1</b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma faltered and retreated as the spacious leather sofa in the middle of the room caught her eye. Then she almost bumped into the man standing behind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She heard a sharp breath from him; he must have been startled as she. She stepped back as if to run away and the man’s blue-gray eyes narrowed.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am so clumsy…”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma muttered helplessly, her eyes on the floor. The atmosphere was positively discomforting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had been running in the woods, so she must look like a mess to him. Her dress had remnants of her descent down the slope under the heavy rain, not to mention the mud that clung to the edge of her skirts. Realizing how dirty she must be, the man’s sharp intake of breath was deeply troubling and embarrassing. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I stink!’’</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma didn’t even realize that her nostrils were flaring.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘What is that wretched smell?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She secretly tried smelling herself,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">worried that the man might regret opening the door after seeing how messy and dirty she looked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, make yourself at home,”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he said thoughtlessly, before he crossed the room with long strides and slumped down onto the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He comfortably spread his legs and sat down brazenly, announcing he was truly the owner of the place. He stared calmly at his new guest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, he looked so arrogant and snobbish, and his aristocratic appearance was extraordinary, but however outstanding he appeared, he seemed to be a simple cabinkeeper.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A true noble would be accompanied by all his attendants, servants, and maids, but the man was thoroughly alone.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Glancing around the room, there was no sign of life, let alone any servants.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, the stable had clearly been empty.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There were no horses, luxurious carriages, or expensive harnesses unique to nobility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a cabinkeeper, it’d be safe to pretend to be the owner when the family wasn’t using the space. Even while doing this, there would be no one keeping an eye on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you planning to stand there forever?”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The man snapped as he made eye contact with Emma, who was constantly squirming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s true that if a stranger walks around looking like a beggar, they’ll be bothersome tot he homeowner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-n-no.”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma was hesitating when she started looking around the cabin.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the simple objects, an antique wooden chair in the corner caught her eye.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a sleek wooden chair that was not covered with fabric.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if it gets smeared because of her wet clothes, she could wipe it with a clean cloth later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will sit over there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Go ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma went to the chair and sat down, her spine as stiff as a tree.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’ll excuse me then.”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt much better to be sitting down after having stood like a block of wood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was still nervous because she was in front of a strange man in a foreign environment, but when she sat on the chair and rested her back, the fatigue that had accumulated from the soles of her feet seemed to ease at once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But different from his somewhat comfortable position on the sofa, the man was still maintaining an invisible barrier around himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was an uncomfortable silence between them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Emma was indebted to the man, she was nervous about what she was supposed to say next, so she couldn’t help but open her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am Emma… Emma Herman. Thank you for saving me from that crisis back there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma, who was sitting in a rigid position, introduced herself awkwardly and offered her gratitude. The man merely nodded as if to say,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She waited for him to speak more, but he just tapped a finger on the sofa’s armrest with an annoyed look on his face.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, another awkward silence settled between the two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Emma had introduced herself first, she thought that it was the man’s turn to do the same, but she must have been mistaken.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Or maybe he didn’t know the first thing about good manners.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the man thought that he didn’t need to show good manners in front of a poor little woman he just saved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma had heard from servants back at Herman-Sumemrville’s largest apothecary that this happened often.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">They turn weak and servile in front of those in high positions, and tough to those in a lower position than them, and do not hesitate to speak ill of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the man kept his silence, sitting still like a stiff wooden doll, Emma shuddered slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When her completely soaked clothes started to cling to her skin, she felt a bitter coldness down to her bones like she was surrounded by a lump of ice.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The stabbing cold permeated her chest.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Small pieces of crushed ice, not warm blood, seemed to be running through her veins.</span></p>
