            <p><strong>Chapter 29.1</strong></p>
<p>Irvan grinded his throbbing member at her soaked core, groaning at her wetness. He placed the tip of his hot pillar at her opening and inserted the head a bit, reveling in the way her petals pushed open for him and hot nectar spilled. He hadn’t even inserted his whole length yet, but Emma’s inner walls swallowed the tip greedily.</p>
<p>Emma was feeling dizzy from the sounds of their l*vemaking. Irvan groaned and strained to insert his member; she was too tight. He suddenly moved his waist forward with more force, and his thick pillar slid forward inside, her inner walls wrapped around him and sucked him.</p>
<p>“Ahh!” Emma m*aned. She could feel the whole length of him throbbing inside of her.</p>
<p>Irvan’s grip on her hips tightened, as he pushed forward, burying the length of him well deep inside her. As their bodies joined together in union, Irvan was beyond ecstactic, and Emma could feel the familiar sweet pleasure gather at their joined bodies.</p>
<p>“Ohhh! Ah!”</p>
<p><em>‘Why does feel so good…’</em> she thought, as her inner walls surrounding his member trembled with pleasure. A thrilling sensation filled Emma inside, and she grabbed the sheets as she made sense of his whole, hot member filling her inside.</p>
<p>Irvan groaned lowly. “You’re crazy tight. It’s enough for you to crush me? Are you going to bite my d*ck off. too?”</p>
<p>“Mmm…” Emma mumbled, eyes hazy. She couldn’t care less of his teasing now. Warm sweat formed on her forehead as her inner walls pulsed against his throbbing member.</p>
<p>She couldn’t move; it felt as if her whole body was wrapped in a tight web. She was paralyzed. The pleasure swirled into a tsunami even at the slightest movement.</p>
<p>She could hear Irvan exhale from behind her. “I still have some room left. Suck me in deeper, Emma,” he commanded huskily.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Yes…”</p>
<p>Whenever her narrow hole wrapped around him and sucked him greedily, a tingling whirlpool of heat flocked to the point of contact.</p>
<p>“Oh, Emma… Keep sucking me.”</p>
<p>Their nether regions were connected as Irvan pinned her down the sheets. She couldn’t move under his firm, desperate grip. Her inner walls took him in deeper, slowly trying to swallow him. But Irvan would not stop until she swallowed him whole. That was for certain.</p>
<p>As if thoroughly ecstactic with this fact, her folds gladly contracted and gobbled him up, and a sweet, thrilling sensation flowed all the way from their joined regions to Emma’s heart.</p>
<p>“It’s greedier than it looks,” Irvan remarked.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! Ah! Mmmm…!”</p>
<p>“I think it’s running out of power… so I’ll have to pump inside it.”</p>
<p>Irvan moved his back, firmly grabbed her bottom and with one stroke, pushed deeper inside her slipper walls.</p>
<p>“Oh! Ahh!”</p>
<p>Emma could feel tingles of electricity in her body. Fever rose within here and her eyes became hazy.</p>
<p>“Your p*ssy likes this,” Irvan whispered, slowly grinding his hips across her outer flesh which was covered in sticky nectar. An unbearable heat soared to her nether regions. Inside, her thirsty walls wound tightly around his stroking member.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think it’d latch on to me so viciously like this.”</p>
<p>Whenever his hot rod moved inside the slightest bit, her inner walls shuddered. At the intense stimulation, Emma almost felt her vision go blank.</p>
<p>“Ahh…! Oh, yes!”</p>
<p>It was hot and dizzying. The deeper he connected their bodies the dizzying the pleasure felt.</p>
<p>“You want more?” Irvan mumbled. He, too, was also overcome with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ah! Yes…!” Emma shook her head and breathed heavily.</p>
<p>Looking down at her with enchanted eyes, Irvan thrusted his member deeper and whispered in her ear. “M*an as you like, Emma. This place is secluded, so no one can hear you.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, that same thought crossed her mind. Could this be the real reason why Irvan had moved them to the annex? Pretending to be generous, he had given her the option to choose, but in fact, his motive was already set.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were broken when Irvan suddenly changed his pace, removing his member and fully inserting it inside her again. Thwack. Thwack. Thwack. The sound of Irvan’s pillar deeply thrusting inside her and slapping against her wet, sticky flesh echoed in the room.</p>
<p>“You’re greedy,” he said. “You keep begging for more no matter how much you swallow me.”</p>
<p>“Ohh. Ahh!” Enduring his mind-numbing pace, Emma gripped the corners of the pillow tight. She struggled with the violent pleasure with his every thrust.</p>
<p>“Huh? You want more?” Irvan wickedly said. And his pace became faster, shallow and intense. Goosebumps erupted on her skin as Irvan thrusted inside her vigourously. “How is it? Do you like that?”</p>
<p>Emma couldn’t answer. Certainly, it felt so good that she couldn’t bear to be apart from him. Her body answered for her instead, sqeezing around him hungrily, and wet nectar constantly spilling.</p>
<p>“I’m curious about the taste of your p*ssy eating my d*ck…”</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>Emma’s heart thrilled with pleasure with his every words. She wanted to beg him for more. Whenever he thrusted his hot member inside her and withdrew it, she was anxious that she wouldn’t achieve her climax, but she knew it was only temporary. Irvan was going to bring her to the height of pleasure.</p>
