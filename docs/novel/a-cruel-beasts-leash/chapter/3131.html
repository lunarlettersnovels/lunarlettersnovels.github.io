            <p><strong>Chapter 23.1</strong></p>
<p>While Miller and Irvan conversed, Emma quietly watched the situation. To these people, she had bared parts of her she didn’t want to show. It was extremely embarrassing and shameful, but no one mentioned the matter to her nor glared for her lack of propriety.</p>
<p>It was because they were too scared to speak; Too conscious of Irvan, they were unable to focus or talk to Emma at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, Emma decided to behave a little brazenly. Sitting mutely, she thought she could pretend it never happened, or better yet, erase it from her memory. She decided to suppress the shame, while her cheeks flamed with other thoughts. Her head was filled with Ircan.</p>
<p><em>‘He may even be a blood relative of a noble family. Since he lives alone in a cabin… then he’s not a descendant but part of the direct line?’</em></p>
<p>Thinking so, it somehow made sense how his meals were luxurious for a cabin keeper. In other words, he had the appetite of a noble, that a commoner couldn’t dare to dream of.</p>
<p>“How long have I been here? I think it has been more than two weeks,” Irvan interrupted her thoughts.</p>
<p>“…it has been three weeks, Sir,” Miller replied meekly from the other side.</p>
<p>“All right. That seems to be about right. I’m sick and tired of this place.”</p>
<p>When Irvan sneered and spoke in a cold tone, Miller flinched as if he had been threatened. Despite facing each other at equal eye level, with a low table between them, one side looked like a wild predator and the other looked like a mere, insignificant subject.</p>
<p>Miller continued speaking. “There is still time left in the treatment period. If you stay until the final day you’ll be able to see results, Sir.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right. My staying in this d*mn place is for my <em>treatment</em>,” Irvan snorted, before gesturing with his chin to the women standing behind Miller. “Why did you bring them?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Miller momentarily froze, before remembering the other people he had brought with him. “Oh… to clean the interior. I thought you’ll start to feel uncomfortable during your stay here.” Miller looked bewildered, as if he was asked an unexpected, but obvious, question.</p>
<p>But then, Irvan critically added, “But you brought handmaidens for this? And not chambermaids?” His eyes squinted cynically towards the man before him.</p>
<p>“Karina ordered them to come, Sir…” Miller began. “They need the work, so handmaidens were chosen for the job.”</p>
<p>“Some work that is…”</p>
<p>The corners of Irvan’s mouth were raised up in a sneer, as if finding the circumstance unpleasant, and his cold gaze bore into Miller. The blue-gray eyes which looked like slates of ice, were not only cold, but haunting. At the end of this treatment, Miller looked nervous, his face stiff.</p>
<p>“You sure you didn’t just drag them in here?”</p>
<p>The accusing words pierced Miller’s heart sharply. “Pardon? N-never!”</p>
<p>When Miller denied quickly with a fervent shake of his head, Irvan chuckled, as if finding the situation humorous. “Are you saying you picked them despite not being familiar with them?” he continued mercilessly. “Even though they might not be trustworthy, it’s all right, considering that it’s Karina, a person you praise so much, who picked them.”</p>
<p>“N-no,” Miller denied panickedly. “That’s definitely not true!”</p>
<p>Irvan narrowed his eyes, finding Miller’s denial foolish. “All right. That is possible,” he began, easing into the couch. “It may be something that my <em>faithful</em> butler Miller knows nothing about. If you don’t know, then there’s no need to make excuses.”</p>
<p>Miller remained quiet, it felt as if he were awaiting a thunderstorm before a calm.</p>
<p>“Still, it’s suspicious. If it’s not true, then, perhaps they should take off their robes?” Irvan demanded.</p>
<p>Miller, who had his head down, flinched at Irvan’s cruel ultimatum. He slowly turned his head back towards the women. The women standing behind where he sat had nervous expressions after seeing his gaze. As Irvan had pointed out the women were wearing long traveler’s robes that covered all skin.</p>
<p>“It’s been ten days since the taste alcohol has changed,” Irvan said, leaning forward. “I was deeply curious, indeed, whether that has anything to do with this or not. Let’s confirm it.”</p>
<p>“S-sir..” One of the women stepped back with a dumbstruck look on her face as she shook her head.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Irvan replied tonelessly. As soon as Irvan carelessly nodded towards Miller, the older man reluctantly instructed his men. The three women weren immediately surrounded by the men.</p>
<p>“Take off their robes,”a cold-hearted Irvan ordered.</p>
<p>At his behest, the men grabbed the sleeves of their robes. The women shivered with frightful expressions, yet they hurriedly stepped back and curled into the ball from the soldier’s touch.  Even though they were only taking off their outerwear, Irvan could guess the reason after awhile.</p>
<p>Indeed, his assumption was correct. Because the moment the robes were taken off, the underwear inside revealed a skimpy outfit for sleeping than casual working clothes.  Although they had put on an apron as if for the pretense of looking like a cleaning maid, the thin underwear they wore inside revealed their curved bodies. Nevertheless, it was a shameful outfit to show in front of others.</p>
<p>Irvan’s icy glare was now directed at them. “You think your breasts aren’t worth seeing,” he sarcastically began. “seeing as you’re covering them as if they’re precious rubies. Then you shouldn’t have exposed them from the beginning.”</p>
<p>At his blunt comments, the handmaidens’ faces all turned red.</p>
<p>“Did you take off your clothes beforehand since they’ll get dirty as you clean? You’re not only cleaning my bed. You should have at least worn something proper.”</p>
<p>Receiving his cold stare, the women only remained silent with their heads lowered to the ground.</p>
<p>Irvan nodded. “So far, it’s too uncertain to call all this a scrafty trick. Should I check to see how much you’ve prepared? Lift their skirts up.”</p>
<p>While Miller’s eyes jumped at the abrupt command, Irvan glared at him.</p>
<p><em>‘Skirts?’ </em>Emma’s eyes widened. Remembering herself, she schooled her expressions, but it seemed as if Irvan had caught her.</p>
<p>“Are you going to object?” Irvan asked her quietly.</p>
<p>Emma was unable to form a quick answer. After all, this was his personal matter. To what extent should she be butting into his life?</p>
<p>“Uh…” After a long time mulling over the situation, it seemed that Miller finally had something to say. “The ha-handmaidens are Karina’s—” he began difficultly, before Irvan cut his words off.</p>
