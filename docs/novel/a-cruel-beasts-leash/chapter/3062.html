            <p><strong>Chapter 57.2</strong></p>
<p>The torch finally brightened the room and she was able to clearly  see the faces surrounding her. Emma straightened her back when she realized that the knight in the lead was Cleve, one of Countess Karina’s bodyguards.</p>
<p><em>‘Cleve!’ </em>Seeing a person who was clearly an enemy, she felt like her throat was burning. Emma swallowed dry saliva and looked at Cleve’s sides in turn. They were the other two knights from that ball. The three of them stood together like an ominous presence.</p>
<p>“Miss Herman, can’t you hear me? Chief Collin was poisoned.”</p>
<p>“…So?” Emma retorted sharply. When she furiously raised her eyes and glared at him, Cleve raised his eyebrows then bursted into laughter.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m just saying,” he said. “That was too bold of you for your first day in this dungeon.”</p>
<p>“How is his condition?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know. Rather, Miss Herman would know better. What poison did you use?”</p>
<p>Emma thought that the knights would ask for Collin’s cure. But they merely sneered at Emma and gazed at her body with lascivi*us eyes. Emma felt like she was about to throw up.</p>
<p>Cleve laughed. “All right, you don’t have to answer. It’s not the first time you’ve done this, right? Many people were speculating as to whether life in prison is familiar to Miss Herman. Nevertheless, there will be a brief physical examination,” Cleve stepped forward, his aquiline nose flaring. He grinned, rubbing his hands together as if he was looking forward to what would happen next. His face looked horribly distorted in the flickering flames. “You might be carrying a bunch of other dangerous things, poisons.</p>
<p>Emma defensively crossed her arms and ran away to a corner of the prison. “D-Dont come c-closer!” she yelled.</p>
<p>“Why are you so afraid?”</p>
<p>Cleve stood in place and laughed with the knights around him. Emma couldn’t understand what was so funny, but the other knights kept laughing their heads off. Emma faltered and kept backing away. She only realized then, that there was no place for her to go. The prison walls blocked her from all sides; the soldiers blocked her only path of entry or escape. She was overcome with fear and her body instinctively stiffened. It was clearly the same situation as before. At some point, the familiar despair swirled from the tips of her toes to her head.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cleve raised his finger at Emma. “Chief Collin is being treated by Mr. Monte. You don’t have to worry because he is an excellent doctor. By the way, time is gold, don’t you agree?”</p>
<p>Emma felt dizzy and her chest was painful. “W-What?” she stuttered, shivering.</p>
<p>“We don’t have much time left.”</p>
<p>“What time?” Emma retorted, trying to buy time.</p>
<p>Cleve smiled at her trembling frame. “It was unfortunate last time. It was a great opportunity for us to <em>hang out</em>, but we couldn’t.” As Cleve said that, he raised his chin arrogantly, and gestured his hand between his legs. Beneath his uniform, the outline of his stiff, erect member protruded. “I was anticipating so much, and in the end, nothing happened. But now…” when he grinned and looked at his fellow knights, the knights also laughed with him.</p>
<p>“Isn’t my huge thing loaded and full of rage?” Cleve laughed.  “However, it’s not just one… but three!” As if they had planned beforehand, the knights bared their trousers and waved their erect pillars in front of Emma. Bile rose in Emma’s throat.</p>
<p>The other knight laughed. “Rumor has it that your night skills are amazing. We can finally taste that hole.”</p>
<p>“That’s right!” the other knight agreed.</p>
<p>“One has to be generous and share things.” Cleve took a step closer and stopped in front of Emma, licking his lips. His eyes were full of l*st as he scanned the slender woman from top to bottom. They traveled to her round, narrow shoulders, her slender waist, and then to her thighs covered by the dress. Cleve gestured to two knights.</p>
<p>“There is a hierarchy in everything. I’ll be the first to taste her, so hold on tight,” he said impatiently.</p>
<p>With those words, the two knights standing beside Cleve rushed at Emma and grabbed both of her arms. Caught by two strong grips from either side, she was unable to move.</p>
<p>“LET GO! LET GO! ARGHH!” As Emma screamed and struggled, Cleve slapped the pipette from her hands. It clattered to the floor.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you had such a dangerous thing,” he said, tsking.</p>
<p>Emma looked in utter panic as Cleve crushed the pipette with his shoe. The sound of the glass breaking and grinding to the floor echoed through the dungeon for a brief moment. In the next instant, it was the sound of the bottom hem of her dress being torn.</p>
<p>“Ahh, here too,” Cleve smirked as he threw the various items in her dress pocket to the floor. “As expected, you were well prepared. It would’ve been a disaster if I had come at you recklessly.”</p>
