<p><strong>Chapter 35.2</strong></p>
<p>At her reply, Collin visibly brightened. He  filled a glass with alcohol and held it out. Grabbing it with both hands, Emma carefully tilted the bottom and drank it.  She instantly hardened her complexion and stayed still, then she suddenly coughed, her face crimson.</p>
<p>At her violent reaction, Collin inquired if she was all right. Emma hadn’t breathed correctly after gulping the drink. Soon, her face turned red and looked like she was suffering.</p>
<p>“I’m f-f-fine.”</p>
<p>Emma, with a pitiful look on her face, touched the middle of her chest with her palm. It was a painful look as if she were being strangled, but when she mumbled that she was all right, Collin blinked. This wasn’t what he had expected.</p>
<p>“Oh, my. I feel bad because it’s like I made you take it,” he said.  The taciturn Karina narrowed her eyes when Collin stepped up and showed his consideration.</p>
<p>“No. Like I said, I can’t hold my liquor well,” Emma struggled to say this, blinking back hot tears.</p>
<p>Collin’s expression turned into embarrassment. “Oh, oh. I see. I was so rude because I want to be close friends with you. What should I do? Should I call a doctor?”</p>
<p>“I, uh, I think I’ll be a bit better if I go take a rest. Will that be okay?” said Emma, wiping away the tear that had fallen from her cheek.</p>
<p>She turned her head with a desperate look on her face. When she begged Countess Karina, not Collin, Karina mechanically smiled and with a gesture of her head, reluctantly allowed her to do so.</p>
<p>Then, thinking about the attention on her, Emma didn’t forget to remain by the handmaidens’ side until she reached the annex. Among the three handmaidens, whom she had run into at the cabin, two of them followed Emma out.</p>
<p>“We will be with you, Miss Herman.”</p>
<p>“Let’s go, madam.”</p>
<p>They both said cordially. The expressions on the two handmaidens were as cold as the countess’s real intentions, and their attitude toward Emma was also extremely businesslike.  The eyes that were glaring at her contained blatant contempt and displeasure.</p>
<p>Emma was the one who had lifted their dresses to make sure they had been wearing underwear at the cabin. From their point of view, it was like being insulted by an unfamiliar woman, so it may be natural to show a bit of hostility when encountering her again. She had merely helped out of consideration that the handmaidens would be embarrassed in front of men, but they did not seem to understand enough to consider that fact.</p>
<p>Emma, who bitterly thought so, bit her bottom lip and walked away. When Emma reached the front of the annex with their help, there was a sound of footsteps rushing from behind.</p>
<p>“Just a second!”</p>
<p>Perhaps Collin had been running with all his might, he was gasping and breathing violently. Each time he exhaled vigorously, the scent of alcohol was dispersed in every direction, so much that the handmaidens’ faces twisted at the pungent stench.</p>
<p>“Today and yesterday it seems that I’ve behaved rudely, so I came to officially apologize,” he began.</p>
<p>“It’s okay.” Emma replied, craning her neck from his breath.</p>
<p>The corners of Collin’s mouth curled up. The fishy smile on his face looked wicked. “I’m so glad you’re okay, but I can’t relax. Can we go inside together and look around until your condition improves?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“The annex.”</p>
<p>Perhaps he thought that Emma hadn’t heard him, Collin cheerfully laughed, and began to babble again. “It’s because I feel bad for ruining your first dinner party.”</p>
<p>Curious expressions from the handmaidens were aimed at Emma when he said this. She quickly grasped what kind of trick he was doing.</p>
<p>“No. I don’t feel comfortable about that,” she replied.  She shook her head sternly. “I don’t need help.”</p>
<p>It seemed to be his purpose to sneak into the annex and harm Emma while Irvan was away. Afterward, Collin would deny it and say that Emma had seduced him first, and as a natural result, all criticisms would pour onto her.</p>
<p>Thinking of the brutal consequence, Emma coldly refuted, “I think my body was just shocked from having taken that alcohol so quickly, so I just want to rest quietly. And I am Irvan’s <em>only</em> guest. No one else has permission to enter the annex.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Isn’t that how a guest feels after being left alone by their host? Who knows if I’ll come in handy and call a doctor to help if your condition doesn’t improve?”</p>
<p>He took a step closer with a sly look in his eyes, with no signs of backing down.</p>
<p><em>‘Come in handy? It would be a relief if this wasn’t a disaster,’ </em>she thought distastely. “I know my body the best. I will be better after I rest.”She continued, glaring at Collin. “I’ll say this once again, but I am fine.”</p>
<p>Visibly avoiding him,  Emma stepped back in front of the door, put her back close to it, and narrowed her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Don’t be that way. Do I look like a weirdo?” Angered, Collin shouted as if he had been insulted. After fixing his eyes on Emma, he approached her in a threatening manner. “You really don’t understand my goodwill. It’s because I don’t feel right leaving you with just the maids.”</p>
<p>Then, the black-haired maid, who was watching Collin’s despicable behavior with interest, quickly winked at the other blonde maid. “Mr. Collin, we will go call a doctor if you stay here and look after Miss Herman. Indeed.”</p>
