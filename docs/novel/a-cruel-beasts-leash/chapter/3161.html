            <p><b>Chapter 6.2</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma couldn’t relax for a moment in front of him, but she was caught in a strange uncertainty when this crisis came: danger and stability;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fear and awe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at his broad shoulders and the straight lines on his back, she was surprised that there was relief,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a sense of safety. It felt like she was hiding under the cool shade of a big tree.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how many chasers were outside, if they saw him here, they’d probably be overwhelmed by him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma would be afraid if this man was an enemy of hers, but at the same time relieved if he was an ally.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s all right. It will be alright.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because she was under his protection now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she reassured herself like that, she felt not a vague feeling, but a clear conviction about safety.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">At the relief that came up, Emma’s uneasiness subsided and her fingers balled into a fist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at that moment, a sudden stream of doubt came to mind.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Could she really trust him to be an ally?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only did she just meet the man a few minutes ago, they hadn’t even exchanged pleasantries and she was the only person to reveal her name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wouldn’t it be too naive to regard him as an ally in this situation?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She didn’t even know who he was. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he’s not going to kick her out irresponsibly, would he?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma’s trembling eyes turned toward the man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t know if it was because of his great physique and the impression of arrogance and hardheadedness, but he didn’t look like someone who would do anything cowardly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps she can trust him.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma has been betrayed desperately by people she had once believed in, but at this moment again, he was the only one she could trust and rely on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she made up her mind, the man finally spoke.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Such a noisy night.”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The incessant knocking pushed the man to go forward in distaste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As outside noise wasn’t able to penetrate the cabin’s fortress-like walls easily, then the chaser must be knocking as hard as they could so that they were able to hear the knocking from inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man, pulling the door viewer open, stood crookedly to look outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry to bother you, but we are searching for someone. Didn’t some young lady come here?”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A polite voice seeped through the open gap.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s Otto!’</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma held her breath in horror.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto has been the Hermans’ butler for a long time.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, he had joined Desmond Herman’s apothecary as a caretaker, and with the confidence of Desmond, he had served as the butler of his family, but at some point, he plotted with Dora and betrayed Emma.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Isn’t it a waste to kill her like this?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I heard it’s scary when a virgin ghost has a vicious grudge.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I think we can take her around with us. Meanwhile, since she’s been working hard, she’s going to serve us.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Will the b!tch obey us?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘If she gets a taste of the hot branding iron, she’ll go wild like a mad chicken or become soft like a lamb. Either way, we have nothing to lose.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto and Dora, who were talking about Emma while threatening her in the carriage, had giggled at what they were so happy about.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘By the way, she looks well-formed. I think we’ll get quite a load of money if we sell her.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Wanna see what she tastes like before another guy gets her?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a grin, Otto even lowered his pants to frighten Emma.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I only have one life to live, so I have to pop a virgin’s cherry before I go. Isn’t that right? Emma?’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Well, she can’t stop you.’</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Hee-hee, I’ll get a little taste of heaven today.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was Emma’s chance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The memories ended, with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma running away with all her might, completely caught off guard by the hideous man and woman who were about to molest her…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A young woman with a small frame. My sweet, young lady,” Otto said in a sickeningly sweet voice, “In the middle of our trip, she suddenly disappeared from our carriage, so I am out here looking for her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the memories earlier in the carriage still fresh in her mind, Emma turned white, her knees beginning to buckle beneath her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hough she had narrowly escaped, she was far from being in the clear…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was barely able to grab the wall and catch her balance. Her heart was thumping heavily against her rib cage; her breath trembling with fear and horror did not subside and her dark contracted pupils faced the front door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the man had eyes on the back of his head, his eyes fixed on her at some point, and were observing Emma. As their eyes met in the air, something flashed across his blue-gray eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto began yapping again, “It’s hard to say this as it’s our first time… but our lady… she is out of her wits! Although she looks normal on the outside, she is actually a very </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">troubled</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> girl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma trembled with ridicule as she heard the absurd slander.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I meant my sweet lady on the surface looks like a normal person, but after hearing her speak for a while, you’ll realize that it’s all gibberish. On top of that, she is delusional, so she’s willing to believe her own lies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stopping there, Otto paused for a second, then he yelled something out loud.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed to lure his accomplice closer to the door.</span></p>
