            <p><strong>Chapter 22.1</strong></p>
<p>Having squeezed her cl!t*ris in his teeth, he simultaneously stretched the tip of his soft tongue on her womanhood and gently rubbed against it.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Emma squirmed and tossed. While Irvan held her firmly so she couldn’t escape, he skillfully twisted his tongue and licked her secret place from top to bottom. A fierce pleasure then came gushing like a waterfall. Her hip shook when his soft tongue mercilessly swept across her vag!na and clit*ris for a long time, as if burrowing there.</p>
<p>“Keep moaning,” he said. “It sounds nice.”</p>
<p>His tongue which claimed her opening, spread the sweet juices that flowed from inside all over folds. Her inner walls were already tight and wet.</p>
<p>“What a vicious hole.”</p>
<p>When the sound of liquid sloshing around lewdly crossed her ears, Emma could feel as if her earlobes were burnt. It didn’t help that Irvan didn’t cease from talking lewdly.</p>
<p>“All this liquid is flowing out from your p*ssy nonstop.”</p>
<p>As Irvan sucked and slurped the clitoris, almost without mercy, her nerves seemed to stand all over on edge of a cliff.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!” she screamed. In an instant, all reasoning Emma was barely holding on to disappeared.</p>
<p>She almost forgot to breath, all attention having stolen by the man’s skillful ministrations with his tongue below her. Her breath hitched as he pushed his tongue deeply inside, and came in gasps when he playfully rolled it across her wet flesh, sucking and teasing her folds and most sensitive places. Emma felt like she was going crazy.</p>
<p>“Here…” he began. While she was moaning, her back arched in ecstacy, Irvan had his head closer to her womanhood, as if exploring a cave. He slowly raised his eyes between her thighs, licking his wet lips.</p>
<p>“There is a scar,” he said. His eyes toward Emma, who was breathing labouredly, thinned to slits. “It’s swollen. It looks painful.”</p>
<p>Without breaking eye contact, he pushed his firm finger into her hole, straightened it then curled it upwards, pushing across a sensitive spot.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Oh, yes!” Emma cried.</p>
<p><em>Squish. Squish. </em>The wanton sounds of her juices being pushed around by his long finger echoed in the bathroom.</p>
<p>“If I wet it with spit then lick it, will it heal quickly?” Irvan muttered curiously.</p>
<p>He then put his words into experiment. The place where his wet tongue touched and sucked her still stung. There would probably be marks left after.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?” Irvan asked, before continuing with his subjugation of her garden.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…! No, ahh!”</p>
<p>Irvan licked her folds intensely. Emma couldn’t fight the coquettish sob that escaped as her sensitive areas were brought to the highest pleasure. Her mind was blank, white. The only sensation that overwhelmed her senses was Irvan’s tongue, claiming every nook and cranny of her private area.</p>
<p>An electrifying thrill wounded throughout her whole body, and inside her womanhood, her sweet juices met his tongue in an unending rush. Still, he lapped at the waves raveneously, bringing her even more pleasure at the thought he indulged himself in <em>her </em>nectar.</p>
<p>“It’s sweet,” he remarked.</p>
<p>There was a sudden shift in his movements. Emma’s flesh, which already heated in pleasure to him, thrummed in excitement for what was to come. Her body was lifted in the air. Emma reflexively stretched out her arms and wound them around his strong shoulders and neck for balance, as Irvan swiftly positioned her legs around his hips meeting her wanting hole with his thick shaft and burying himself inside her in one swift motion.</p>
<p>There was an audible smack in the air as their bodies collided, their juices squished underneath the soft flesh. Emma’s body trembled as if she had been struck by lightning. Her wet flesh and inner walls greeted his long, thick shaft in a heated embrace. She could feel him throb inside her, leaving no inch of space unoccupied.</p>
<p>Emma’s heart beat furiously. It was thrilling beyond her wildest imagination.</p>
<p>The strong man’s body began to move in fluid, quick strokes. He held her shaking body in the air, like the waves breaking into the shore. He came out her swiftly as she exhaled a breath, then thrust inside her hard and full. The sensation rendering her unable to breathe and leaving her body shaking.</p>
<p>Irvan continued this pace. Emma was completely dominated by the pleasure. Inside and out. Thrusting hard, mercilessly making her submit to him. Only the sounds of their lovemaking, moans and pants echoed throughout the bathroom.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>Almost at the height of passion, Emma could feel a surge build up to its climax. She clung to him desperately, clawing his back, as his thick member continued to ravish her inner walls, expanding the cramped space and hitting her deepest part. All of the sudden, it felt like a bomb came off. She came with him, her mind blanking as his s*emen filled her with her release.</p>
<p>“Whew,” Irvan exhaled laboriously, slowly pulling his member out. As his shaft left her still twichting entrance, his white s*men flowed from the inside and dripped to the bath water. Irvan clucked his tongue and lifted the listless Emma over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“You can’t bathe in this water, but it’ll be better for your wound than spit…” He swept his hand over her back, as if comforting her small frame, and gave her butt a gentle smack. “Will it do? Or is spit still better?”</p>
<p>Emma’s sensitive body flinched with the barest stimulation, so Irvan placed her back down. As if he still hadn’t had his fill, he covered her perk n*pples with his warm mouth, then lowered his head and buried his face inside her vagina once again.</p>
<p>Emma couldn’t believe him. “Ahh!”</p>
<p>When her clitoris, already at the height of pleasure, was stimulated again with his tongue, her waist fiercely trembled and their combined liquid inside gushed outside.</p>
<p><em>Drip. Drip. </em>As if satisfied with the cloudy s*men falling on the water surface, Irvan smiled at Emma before lifting her and carrying her out of the bathroom.</p>
