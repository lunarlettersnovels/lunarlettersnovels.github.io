            <p><strong>Chapter 30.1</strong></p>
<p>As soon as Emma’s cl*max started, her inner walls tightened deliciously around Irvan’s throbbing member. Soon, her vision turned black as the violent pleasure rose.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>While Emma reached her peak, Irvan groaned and picked up his pace, thrusting the deepest part of her inside that it felt like she was going to shatter. At the same time, he sealed Emma’s mouth with his own, swallowing her m*ans.</p>
<p>S*liva and her sweet nectar wrapped around their tongues engaged in a dance. His kiss was fierce, demanding and passionate beyond measure, and the further he coveted her lips, the deeper and more pleasurable their l*vemaking became.</p>
<p>“Ah! Shi*t!”</p>
<p>Irvan couldn’t help but curse as Emma’s inner flesh contracted aggressively against his pillar, crushing his hot meat. The full friction between her bumpy inner walls and the veins along his member, and his quick, strong thrusts felt frighteningly good. Emma felt as if she electrocuted by a lightning of thrill and pleasure.</p>
<p>At the peak of release, Irvan grunted and firmly held Emma as he thrusted even more fiercely inside her.</p>
<p>“Oh…” Emma’s eyes fluttered as Irvan groaned from above her.</p>
<p>His liquid poured deep inside her, filling her ut*rus.</p>
<p>“Not enough…” Irvan’s forehead wrinkled, as he continued to move his waist, emptying his entire load inside Emma. “More, Emma… More…”</p>
<p>The throbbing, angry member filled the space like a huge boulder stuck inside a cramped hole. Every time he pressed against her deepest spot, Emma’s walls shuddered and more of his hot liquid spilled out. He withdrew and bended her thighs further and squeezed his member inside her dripping hole again.</p>
<p>“Emma.. does that feel good? Huh?”</p>
<p>Hot nectar and thick cream flowed from the wet hole filled with his thick pillar. Simultaneously pressed down by his weight, a thrilling sensation soared along the curve of her spine. Then, finally, Emma had a dazzling, second climax.</p>
<p>Her eyes fluttered shut as Irvan groaned above her, crushing her petite frame. Then, when their pleasure had passed, he whispered her name near her ear.</p>
<p>“Emma…”</p>
<p>Still listless, Emma mumbled tiredly, “Mmmh… Yes?”</p>
<p>“Do I feel good?”</p>
<p>Emma just wrapped her arms around him and let out a small m*an at the slight movement. His member was still inside her and the after-pleasure was intoxicating. “Oh, yes. You feel so good…”</p>
<p>Satisfied with her answer, Irvan slowly parted their joined bodies. However, when Emma cast her eyes on his m*nhood, she could see his member was still stiff. Emma could feel liquid trickle down her hole as he released her.</p>
<p>Irvan satisfactorily looked at hole drenched with his cream and smiled cheekily. “We can’t be apart even for a second now.”</p>
<p>The hot energy filling her wet interior was gone, and Emma trembled as if she had come down with chills. Irvan chuckled and kissed her cheek. “Despite my diligence in filling you, my d*ck is still throbbing like this. What a shame. Should I fill you up again?” he added huskily.</p>
<p>As his low, mischievous voice tickled her earlobes, he teased through her wet opening slowly with tip of his member. Her folds audibly squelched in the air.</p>
<p>Emma’s knees parted of their own accord. “It feels good…” Emma caressed his backside gently, and looked at him through hazy eyes, “It’s hot and thick.”</p>
<p>Irvan exhaled deeply, as if savoring the feeling that overwhelmed his lower body. The he moved his waist slowly. Despite being over stimulated, Emma’s walls still shuddered with pleasure when he slowly slid against her inner walls again. She embraced him even tighter as he filled her gaping space with his erect member.</p>
<p>“How about now?” Irvan whispered, grabbing her bottom and crushing their bodies together.</p>
<p>“Mmh.. yes…” Emma could only mumble.</p>
<p>Everytime their bodies filled each other, it felt unbearably pleasurable, passionate and sweet. Like an addiction, Emma couldn’t get enough of it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A day had passed since Emma was soaked in a deep, honey-like dream. Irvan coveted Emma, never leaving her, and secluding themselves in the annex. She also felt wholly immersed with their passionate l*vemaking, wondering everytime he touched her if her body would melt.</p>
<p>“I like that you’ve only learned to passionately covet someone now.”</p>
<p>Emma’s cheeks heated up at Irvan’s racy whisper caressing her skin. “It’s not that late,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>Irvan chuckled, nuzzling her neck. “Is that so?”</p>
<p>“What about you, Irvan?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Yes. When did you learn?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Irvan merely chuckled, and entangled their bodies even deeper.</p>
<p>“Mmmh…”</p>
<p>His body was different from normal, but his hot touch was irresistible. When he explored her deepest part and slid past her inner walls in a delicious rhythm, all that ran through Emma’s mind was a c*rnal pleasure.</p>
<p>Emma thought she had just asked him something, but her mind had turned blank.</p>
<p>“Young lady, your memory is worse than it looks. Or was that a trap question?”</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah!”</p>
<p>“I like you…” he whispered as he continued stimulating her sensitive body. “You’re so clever.”</p>
<p>Under his unbearable ministration, Emma squirmed and m*aned. Dawn came at some point, and after falling asleep in exhaustion, their pleasurable activities resumed the next night. She would reach her peak again and again and fall into deep slumber.</p>
<p>But recently, the annex was quiet for the past two days. Now, it was the fourth day when a knock echoed at the door.</p>
