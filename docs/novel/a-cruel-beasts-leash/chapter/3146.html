            <p><strong>Chapter 15.1</strong></p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“Why? You don’t like this?”</p>
<p>Emma’s body relaxed. <em>I have already done it before anyway. It’s a passionate feeling that I can’t seem to resist. </em>Besides, Emma was curious. Emma had no memory of their first night and she was curious of this man and the passionate emotions within her. She was curious what it would be like to spend the night in his arms and how it might have been the first time.</p>
<p>He looked at her and Emma gave the smallest nod of her consent. His mouth twitched into a smile. “Okay,” he whispered, huskily, “Just relax.”</p>
<p>The moist, hot tongue gently slipped inside her lips and began to explore her tongue. “I’m happy that I don’t even have to hesitate.” As the remnant of the smell of alcohol infused her mouth, Emma found herself drunk on something else, desire with a mix of honey-sweet alcohol smell.</p>
<p>“Oh, my,” Emma, who had been gripping the arms that held her, relaxed and her nerves calmed. As soon as her body went limp with the lack of tension, the strong arms pulled her close until she was pressed against his strong and sturdy chest.</p>
<p>“You fit right into my arms as though you were made solely for me.” He embraced her tightly. Emma, rather than feeling suffocated and uncomfortable by this stranger, felt snug and safe and fit into his embrace like a missing puzzle piece. Almost as though she had been incomplete this whole time and only just found her another half.</p>
<p>Snug in his embrace, Emma deepened the kiss. “You are strange. Quite strange.” The man pushed his frantic tongue deeper into hers and kissed her passionately.</p>
<p>Emma trembled in pleasure. She relished the feel of his kisses. “You smell good,” he whispered. His tongue explored hers. It felt as though both of them melted within each other to form just one pleasurable feeling.</p>
<p>“A seductive and fascinating scent.” His whispers sank in Emma’s ears and embedded in her mind. At the same time, the closeness kindled a sensuality that she had never felt before. It felt good. He tasted like sweetness itself. The damp softness too her breath away and her soul with it. She had no words to describe how exactly she felt. “I didn’t know you would taste this good,” he said. He deepened his kiss, sucking at her lips. “It is strange.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh,” she sighed.</p>
<p>His hot tongue explored her soft mouth and penetrated deeper into her throat. “I guess you like it too, huh?”</p>
<p>His voice lingered in her ears, but she couldn’t respond. She was mesmerised by the gaze of this man who kissed her so sweetly yet so passionately. She was amazed by this sort of violent tenderness of his.</p>
<p>As the kiss continued, his blue-grey eyes narrowed slightly before relaxing, as if to confirm whether she had any objection to this. Finding none, he kissed her fiercely than before. They were tongue-tied with each other. The kiss lingered for a long time. </p>
<p>In the beginning, Emma had felt like running away awkwardly but as she was repeatedly teased by him, she had a sudden urge to win him over. She didn’t remember it but she was sure there had been a dozen kissed that happened the other night. Emma felt frustrated when she felt that her body moved awkwardly. It wasn’t as if she hated those kisses. And they had been together and done it before, so why was it that she her body felt awkward?</p>
<p>Emma decided to throw herself all into it and moved her tongue teasing him. The kiss felt different now. As she kissed him back, she got a feel of his tongue. An unfamiliar sensation bloomed in her body and she trembled. As if some sort of trigger had gone off, her body heated up and it asked for more.</p>
<p><em>I can’t believe a kiss between a man and a woman feels like this. </em>It felt like being struck by a lightening on a rainy day. As her yearning heightened, her nerves were on edge and her body felt hot like it was on fire. A strange pleasure that she found herself short of words to explain. <em>It feels like my body is melting. The feeling of this knot of heat in the centre of my body that wants to go off. That wants to explode.</em></p>
<p>Emma felt something wet between her legs. Her lower body, full of heat, trembled, struck by sensuality.</p>
