            <h3>Chapter 26.2</h3>
<p>Emma’s eyes were cast to the ground while listening to Irvan. “Lord Irvan,” she quietly said.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Should I be careful?”</p>
<p>“There is nothing bad about being careful,” he picked his words carefully, nodding.</p>
<p>Emma asked if the Muns siblings were allies, and her eyes became more solemn when he answered with an affirmative. Calmly keeping his eyes on her form, he stood up and lightly patted her shoulders.</p>
<p>“We should wash up while the outside is getting ready,” he said, already forgetting talks of lineages and complex family relations. He seemed more agonized that he had ridden a horse for hours in demon blood.</p>
<p>He took off his shirt and walked towards the bathroom. As if concluding their prior conversation with her fears, he said, “You’ll find out about the rest as time goes by. Still, it’s best if you don’t meet her too much.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Irvan finally came out, bathed and smelling fresh of soap, a large towel wrapped around his lower body. His eyes were drowsy and satisfied as he stared at Emma. But beneath that, there was a familiar longing gaze that made her body shiver at that moment; a look she was all too familiar with.</p>
<p>Like a prey trapped in a jar, she would be swallowed whole in no time.</p>
<p>As her cheeks instinctively heated up under his gaze, that flame extended to her body and to more treacherous places. She pressed her knees together in attempt for control.</p>
<p>“…I should wash up, too,” she announced quietly. Emma grabbed her dress and stepped towards the bathroom with her head down as if avoiding his deep gaze. Irvan blocked the way with a playful smile.</p>
<p>“Should I wash again too?” he said.</p>
<p>“No!” Emma cried out. As she quickly headed inside as if she were running away, Irvan’s eyes followed her petite frame, a playful smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Relax. I won’t bother you.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The bathroom of Van Wert Castle was several times more luxurious than the one in the cabin, and the facilities were the best. Unlike the historic exterior traced with time, the interior was well-kept and elegant, especially the bathroom. Emma didn’t know how it was done, but hot and cold water were always supplied through pipes connected to the bathtub, so there was no need to draw water and fill it up. Clear water was at her fingertips with a twist of the faucet.</p>
<p>Having filled the bathtub halfway with warm water, Emma took plenty of time to slowly wash herself. It felt strange to wash in the same place that smelled too much like Irvan, but she would gradually get used to it the longer she stayed.</p>
<p>She lathered the sponge with soap and wiped her body with a generous amount of foam. With every bit of movement, she was also shaking away the complicated thoughts that riddled her head.</p>
<p>“Should I help you wash?” Another complicated figure burst into the scene.</p>
<p>With Irvan’s unexpected entrance, Emma immersed herself underwater. She looked at him indignantly, “You said that you wouldn’t bother me!”</p>
<p>“Oh… Did I?” he said sheepishly, not bit repentant. “I thought you may need something.” Irvan slid over towards the bathtub with a grin on his face as if he were having a blast.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” Emma said, gently scooping foams into her hands, and pointedly ignoring him.</p>
<p>“Are you really fine?” He looked down from beside her. Emma allowed herself to steal a look. Before, he was dressed in ordinary clothes, but his current attire reflected his extreme aristocratic upbringing.</p>
<p>Seeing his tall physique neaetly clothed in luxurious clothes, Emma felt her eyes widen in adoration. If he had worn expensive silk from the beginning, he would never have been mistaken for a cabin keeper or a mere commoner. His attire, immaculately tailored to fit his body perfectly, completely changed his aura; dignity and elegance naturally emenated from him.</p>
<p><em>‘He really does look like a prince from a fairy tale.’</em></p>
<p>After admiring his wonderful appearance, she raised her eyes and looked up at him.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Reading the admiration in her eyes, Irvan’s mouth was set to pleased smile. “Do I look different dressed like this?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But it doesn’t suit the location. Please leave,” Emma replied bluntly.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to. I guess I’ve formed quite the noble hobby. I want to peek at the beautiful lady taking a bath today,” he whispered lowly.</p>
<p>But Emma merely shook her head firmly toward Irvan. “I am finished. All I have to do is dry up now.”</p>
<p>“Then I will do that for you. Come on out.” Irvan pulled a large towel from the shelf, a mischevious smile was still plastered on his face.</p>
<p>Seeing him do that, Emma hesitated as she shook her head no again. “N-no. It’s okay, I’ll do it myself. If you get all wet dressed up like that…”</p>
<p>Irvan brushed off her comment with a shrug. “I’ll just change again.”</p>
<p>“No, no! Really, I’m fine. I’ll be out after I’m done.”</p>
<p>“I have lots of clothes. This is my room.”</p>
<p>“Still–”</p>
<p>“I can dry you.”</p>
<p>Emma racked her brains for a reason. “The water is dirty. It will dirty your outfit,” she argued.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll wash it,” Irvan relentlessly shot her down.</p>
<p>“That’s more work for you.”</p>
<p>“So what? That’s just one of the many things I do every day.”</p>
<p>“No,” Emma shook her head, a laugh threatening to bubble from her chest at the persistent Irvan, “My body looks the best when I wash and dry myself. Can you back up a bit?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to. I’m holding this towel so I can dry you off.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, really.”</p>
