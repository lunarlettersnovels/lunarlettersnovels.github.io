            <p><strong>Chapter 49.1</strong></p>
<p>“I happen to be in good condition,” Evelyn said. “Let’s enjoy touring around the city together tomorrow. There are so many popular attractions in Wert City.”</p>
<p>Evelyn’s lively appearance was refreshing; perhaps because she had gotten rid of her serious menstrual cramps.</p>
<p>“Whenever I visit a new city after spending time in the countryside, it feels like my whole being is refreshed. You’ll feel the same way, too, Miss Herman.”</p>
<p>With Evelyn’s endless chattering, Emma deduced that she was a person with a bright and bubbly personality.</p>
<p>“Evelyn, it’s late. Stop bothering Miss Herman and let her get some rest,” Baroness Berne interrupted.</p>
<p>Emma turned to the old man, and said, “Thank you so much for inviting me.”</p>
<p>Baroness Berne waved her hands lightly when Emma spoke kindly to her. “No, it’s nothing. A guest of Irvan is a guest of ours. Especially when considering the favor Lady Charline did.”</p>
<p>“Lady Charline?”</p>
<p>“Oh, she’s…”</p>
<p>Evelyn clapped her hands and butted into the conversation once more. Charline was Irvan’s biological mother and the former countess. It had been a long time since Charline had passed away, but her influence was still profound in the land.</p>
<p>The backstory was a little complicated, but to sum up the complicated tale, it was all about money. It was said that the previous count—Irvan’s grandfather—was a great but extravagant man who was a spendthrift. His intemperance left Count Van Wert with great financial struggles. Charline had appeared like a savior.</p>
<p>Charline, the only heiress of a wealthy parochial royal family, was considerably older than the Count Van Wert, and she had brought in a huge dowry to save Count Van Wert from his financial struggles, and as collateral, she became the owner of one-fourth of downtown Wert City.</p>
<p>Most of that humongous property is said to have been entrusted to Baron Berne, who already had a reputation for his integrity at that time and was familiar with accounting. Baron Berne had been ordered by Countess Charline to increase the value of the property, and he had begun the project of building a city, and later he would become a tycoon of Reshire.</p>
<p>After the death of Charline, who died tragically from birth difficulties, her only son, Irvan, remained the sole, qualified heir. Therefore, all of the most valuable land resources in the bustling Wert City belong to Irvan.</p>
<p>Emma could now see why Irvan was indifferent towards money from the very beginning. He was the richest man in Reshire and next in line to become Count Van Wert, so he had both wealth and status. On top of that, his appearance was outstanding, so he literally had nothing else to desire.</p>
<p>“…if Lady Charline were alive things would have been so different,” Baroness Berne mumbled as she exchanged glances with her husband.</p>
<p>Emma had always wondered how Baron Berne’s relationship with Irvan was deeper than that of a regular relationship of a master and a servant. <em>‘So, there was a backstory,’</em> she thought. Baron Berne was bound to be Irvan’s closest aide as he took charge of managing the property he’d inherited from Charline, and through that, the family stood tall.</p>
<p>“So, any guest of Irvan is our guest of honor. That’s why you may use our space as your home. And please tell me if you have some curiosities or if you need something.”</p>
<p>Finally, Evelyn’s eyes become droopy. She motioned to the maid. “Hey, now I’ll lead Miss Herman to the guestroom. It’s the best one in this manor,” she said to Emma.</p>
<p>Lady Evelyn stepped aside and allowed her maid to go on ahead the hallway. Behind her, servants followed with bags in their hands.</p>
<p>They stopped in front of a room. “This is it. Do you like it?” Evelyn asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, you shouldn’t have,” Emmas said, embarrassed at the excessive hospitality.</p>
<p>Lady Evelyn smiled brightly and shook her head. Emma looked around the room.</p>
<p>“It’s shabbier than Van Wert Castle’s annex. Oh, that place was built by the former count. It is said that he devoted his money generously to his favorite lady at that time.”</p>
<p>Emma had learned this for the first time. The annex was located in the middle of a pond, so Emma thought somehow that the place was secretive and quiet, as if it was originally used for secret rendezvous.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know that,” Emma commented.</p>
<p>Lady Evelyn’s eyes went wide. “Uh-oh! I shouldn’t have said that. It’s something you don’t need to know. I was so giddy to see you that I made a slip of the tongue. Sorry,” she said sheepishly. Lady Evelyn turned her head to glance out the window, yawning as she commented on how late it was.</p>
<p>“Goodnight. I hope our home is comfy.”</p>
<p>“It is really pleasant. Thank you for choosing a good room for me. Sleep tight.”</p>
<p>“See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>When the door was finally closed and only Emma remained, she sank onto the soft bed. It had been an eventful and hectic day. Now that the day had ended with no issues, all she wanted to do was to close her eyes and sleep.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Each day at the Bernes’ home passed like a flying arrow. After a few days, she settled into the calm sanctuary, learned the geography of the place like the back of her hand and met all of the servants.</p>
<p>“Madam, a letter has arrived.”</p>
<p>“Put it there.”</p>
<p>As the handmaiden put down a bunch of luxurious envelopes on the table, Evelyn reached out with a look of annoyance.</p>
<p>“They’re mostly invitations. At most, there are one or two personal letters. And even those are just family members saying hello,” she explained.</p>
<p>Baron Berne, one of the most influential people in Wert City, was constantly invited to various exhibitions and events. There were not only invitations for birthdays and tea ceremonies but a considerable amount of appeals for sponsorships and donation banquets.</p>
