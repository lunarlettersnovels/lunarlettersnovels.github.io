            <p><strong>Chapter 29.2</strong></p>
<p>“Oh… you love this so much, don’t you? You’re so wet…” he whispered lasciovously. “I’m hurt that you aren’t replying, my dear Emma.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Oh!” Emma’s back arched as she m*aned, excited and anticipating for the sweet release.</p>
<p>But then, Irvan suddenly pulled back, and his throbbing member easily slid out of her. Her petals, pink and wet, trembled at the sudden loss.  Irvan nudged her petals bottom apart, spreading her petals with the action as nectar dripped from her aching hole.</p>
<p>“Your p*ssy is in full bloom. It’s trembling for me.”</p>
<p>Irvan’s deep eyes marvelled at Emma as if he were admiring a beautiful piece of art. His hot gaze fixed on the delicious folds that called for him. His member throbbed for it.</p>
<p>“Such a pretty p*ssy. Delicious…”</p>
<p>Emma closed her eyes, flinching, waiting for him. Behind her, there was a pause before Irvan breathed heavily. Then, he positioned his hard pillar in front of her trembling, soaking hole and slowly slid inside.</p>
<p>“Mmh…” Irvan m*aned lowly. “Your hole is opening up.”</p>
<p>“Ohh…!” Emma couldn’t breathe at the slow, agonizing contact. Then, he grabbed her hips with more force and slid deeper inside her, rubbing their outer flesh when their bodies connected fully. Her inner walls eagerly accepted him once again, twitching as his hot member pulsed inside.</p>
<p>Irvan then said, “Look at me.”Emma craned her head back to look at his heady blue-gray eyes. “Tell me what my d*ck tastes like.”</p>
<p>Intoxicated, Emma’s breath hitched. Then, giving her no time to reply, Irvan withdrew his member and fully thrust it inside her again. She twitched beneath him, but his grip would not let her break their contact apart.</p>
<p>“Ohhh!” Emma m*aned. The pleasure was so much that tears crept down her eyes.</p>
<p>Irvan’s eyes satisfactorily scanned the tears running down her face. “Emma,” he murmured, as maintaining a languid pace of thrusting. He would make her feel loss by withdrawing, then bring her to ecstasy by fully burrowing inside her again. Emma continuously m*aned, her bottom moving on its own accord to meet his thrust faster. But Irvan would not let her.</p>
<p>“You like that?” Irvan whispered. Then, his thumb reached towards her pointy, sensitive nub. He rubbed her nub with the nectar that spilled outside, as his own pillar was burrowed inside. Emma shuddered fiercely.</p>
<p>“When I touch you…” His finger suddenly pressed harder on her sensitive nub. “I get curious if you’ll taste even better if I stimulate you like this…”</p>
<p>Everything was now hazy in Emma’s eyes. Everytime Irvan thrusted inside, he would press her nub, and nectar gushed out as Emma experienced a higher sense of ecstacy.</p>
<p>Irvan groaned. “It’s flowing nonstop… You look delicious.”</p>
<p>Emma could barely support her legs. “Ahhh, yes… mmmh… ahhh!”</p>
<p>The astonishing pleasure made her tilt her head back, and the next instant, pleasure rose to the top of her head. Her whole body felt impatient, as if burning angrily due to the dizzying stimulus from her fiercely stimulated regions.  Her body moved in accord with him, if not more impatient. Her pink nub flinched with his thumb and her inner walls contracted with his hot, thick flesh inside. Her nectar flowed without end and trickled down her inner thighs.</p>
<p>The nerves that had gradually melted were about to break.</p>
<p>“It’s swollen. It must be angry.”</p>
<p>He suddenly retracted his member from her hole and lowered his head to suck her nub. As he swept over it with his hot, soft tongue, Emma was so enchanted that her soul seemed to be sucked out of her body at that moment.</p>
<p>Irvan chuckled, his hot breath hitting her folds. “So delicious.”</p>
<p>Her thighs trembled, and her inner walls tightened violently as her slender back arched, as if she had been hit by lightning. And her hands and feet curled, as if she had been electrocuted.</p>
<p>At that moment, Emma felt Irvan was the incarnation of lust.</p>
<p>Without pause, he gently licked her petals and her nub. Then, he would dig trespass against it, digging inside her walls.</p>
<p>“Your p*ssy in full bloom is delicious, Emma…”</p>
<p>He pressed and stimulated the soft, sensitive area heavily with hot lips, and sucked it without hesitation. As her hot nectar spilled over her folds and nub, it was l*wdly mixed with his moist sal*va. Emma couldn’t come to her senses; all she vividly felt was the movement of Irvan’s tongue below.</p>
<p>“Your p*ssy lip keeps twitching. It feels like I’m k*ssing you.”</p>
<p>He continued his onslaught with his tongue, licking and sucking everything. Before long, there was a strong sense of pleasure that suddenly swarmed in, begging for release.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah! Irvan!”</p>
<p>“I’m going crazy.” Irvan quickly sat and turned her on her backside so that she was facing him. Then, he pried her thighs apart, settled his weight upon her and desperately thrusted his huge member inside her excited hole, filling her to the tip. It was at that moment Emma felt something burst inside in the cramped passage of their joined bodies, and her mind quickly blanked white.</p>
<p>“Mmmh! Ah! Yes!”</p>
<p>Her whole body felt like it was about to split, but her wet inner walls which fiercely embraced Irvan trembled with joy.</p>
