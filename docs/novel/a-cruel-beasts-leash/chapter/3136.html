            <p><strong>Chapter 20.2</strong></p>
<p><em>‘Again?’</em></p>
<p>Was he trying to start what they had done last night? It wasn’t that Emma didn’t like his enchanting sensuality, but it didn’t feel right to go at it again without giving her time to rest for a while. Not to mention she had to deal with her other needs.</p>
<p>“Let’s wait a bit,” she began, trying to extract herself from his arms.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be a really short break.”</p>
<p>“I said no.”</p>
<p>For a moment she felt as if she were dealing with a large, disobedient child, but she explained gently, without showing any indication of finding the situation comical. “But I still have to go to the bathroom…”</p>
<p>“Hmmm.” The firm hand which held her slowly loosened. But it didn’t completely let her go. “Do you want me to take you? You must feel uncomfortable since it stings.”</p>
<p>“I’m f-f-fine.”</p>
<p>“Can you even walk?”</p>
<p>After letting out a breath over her shoulder, he suddenly stood and lifted Emma.</p>
<p>“Whoa!”</p>
<p>She struggled in Irvan’s arms as she was carried in bridal style fashion. Irvan smiled, finding her adorable, and walked straight into the bathroom. After gently setting her down in front of the bathtub, he turned the faucet to fill it up.</p>
<p>“You can go now. Bathroom,” he said.</p>
<p>“Now?”</p>
<p>“Right. It’s less embarrassing since the water is running.”</p>
<p>That was an answer she could not refute. Emma shyly bowed her head. Taking one last glance at th emanchild before her, she bolted out of the bathroom and went to the bathroom in the far corner down the hall.</p>
<p>Emma realized how strange it felt to run naked around the mansion. While snooping around wondering if there was anything to put on, she found a thin gown on a shelf in the corner of the hallway. She put it on right away and entered the bathroom again with the gown tied tightly around her frame. The tub was already filled with water.</p>
<p>As Irvan filled it by pouring water from a large bucket, his muscles, like well-women threads, rippled rythymcally on his shoulders and to his waist, and down to his solid hips. Not even sparing his thighs, and the elongated calves to his ankles – he had such a resilient and beautifully sculpted physique.</p>
<p>Emma could not take her eyes off him.</p>
<p>As she silently watching him slacked-jaw, she finally came back to her senses. Had she not caught herself a moment earlier, she would have drooled because of how her mind had wandered while admiring his body. She looked at the ground, feeling a sense of shame, then stepped into the tub.</p>
<p>She leaned back at the head of the tub and lightly ran her fingers through the water.  “Excuse me… it’s a bit cold,” she muttered.</p>
<p>The reason Irvan had filled the tub with water was probably so that she could warm her body up, but the temperature was too cold for that.</p>
<p>“The water temperature is too low,” she repeated whe Irvan didn’t answer. She got out of the water; it was impossible to lay comfortably in the tub.</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I think my whole body will get numb if I stay in like this.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm.” Irvan stopped in his tracks and stood with his arms crossed, almost too proudly. He remained quiet as his eyes shifted back and forth for a long time between Emma and the bathtub as if something strange was going on.</p>
<p>“Hold on a second.”</p>
<p>He left Emma standing in front of the bathtub and turned around to head to the living room.</p>
<p>Catching a glance at his leaving form, Emma’s cheeks reddened as explicit thoughts once began to cloud her head. Her heart fluttered against her chest as she saw the back of his wonderful physique and the long legs that extended below the waist, his arm muscles that tightly clumped like together. His solid body overwhelming, pressing against her last night…</p>
<p>A thrilling sensation spread between her thighs, and the colorful sight of both of them tangled in bed, naked, came to mind like a lucid dream. It felt as if her ehad would explode, and her cheeks were too warm.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Emma lowered her eyes to calm the sudden heat inside. She leaned against the bathtub and looked far away at the floor as he returned with a large bucket full of scarlet, glowing lumps.</p>
<p>“What are those?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Charcoal,” he replied. He placed down the bucket and bent over the edge of the tub. It seemed like he had taken them from the fireplace.</p>
<p>“I have never done this before, but I can put them in here.”</p>
<p>He grabbed a drawer-like thing at the bottom of the brass tub and opened it to fill it with charcoal. Surprisingly, the tub began shaking as if the water was boiling. As the noisy seething sound subsided, the water quickly cooled down. When Emma dipped her finger again, the water was not hot enough to produce steam but also not cold enough to call it lukewarm.</p>
<p>“That’s how it’s used?” she marvelled.</p>
<p>“Probably.”</p>
<p>Emma scanned the tub excitedly. <em>‘So, this was the function of the drawer at the bottom of this brass tub.’</em> An efficient system to heat water.</p>
<p>Perhaps because it was the cabin of a noble family, Emma thought that the bathtub was extraordinarily luxurious.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the question of whether a she could use the bathroom in a noble’s bathtub without permission rose in her head. However, there was no one else but the two of them in the cabin, and thus, no one to spy on them. This reason felt justified to Emma.</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>While she was so lost in thought, Irvan, who had approached her at some point, hugged her from behind. As his large hands wrapped under her armpits, her body lightly ascended in the air like a feather.</p>
<p>“Take off this annoying thing.”</p>
<p>Irvan easily peeled of the tightly wrapped gown from Emma, rendering her efforts of staying clothed futile.</p>
