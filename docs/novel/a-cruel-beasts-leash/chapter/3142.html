            <p><strong>Chapter 17.1</strong></p>
<p>With no change given to process what was happening, Emma gasped in pleasure as his tongue plunged inside her. His soft tongue penetrated her, and she sighed in ecstasy. “Ahh!”</p>
<p>His cool tongue explored her gently at first, rubbing at the slit.</p>
<p>“Ah, oh!”</p>
<p>The movement of his tongue became frantic, and it veered upward and clamped on her most sensitive part. He teased and sucked hard at her cl*t sending her over the edge.</p>
<p>“Oh, oh!”</p>
<p>As he teased her most intimate part fiercely, she felt a pulsating heat emanate from within. The heat spread all over her lower region and engulfed her. The sharp excitement with the s*xual tension aroused her.</p>
<p>“Ahhh! Ohh!”</p>
<p>She felt a numb, sweet pain when he sucked at her cl*t. The he licked it and rubbed it gently only to dig deep and lap at it violently.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Her hips shook to the rhythm of his tongue, occasionally buckling against him as his tongue teased her relentlessly. She felt all the pleasure crest and something slippery slipped out from between her legs and she let out a shuddering moan.</p>
<p>“You are soaking wet,” he whispered. Emma’s head shuddered in pleasure. “It’s alright. Let it all out.”</p>
<p>She instinctively clamped her legs shut but his arms pressed down on her thighs, holding them in place as his frustrating face appeared before her. “It was here. The place with the strongest scent.”</p>
<p>The man grinned, reveling at the scent pouring out of her with the liquid and plunged his head down again. “Ahhh! No, don’t… hmm.” Emma bit her lips trying to gather herself as his tongue dove deeper into her.</p>
<p>“Don’t what?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Ahh, ohh!” she moaned.</p>
<p>The man licked her insides and plunged his tongue even deeper. His tongue tickled her, and the obscene noise shocked her. But it added to the stimulation that hit her in waves.</p>
<p>“Can I not taste it?”</p>
<p>“Ohh! Ah!”</p>
<p>The tip of the tongue poked inside. “I’m already dipping my tongue in and tasting it. I might as well taste you whole.” The man’s tongue reached deeper, poking through a region full of sticky, dew-like liquid. When he relentlessly continued his ministrations, she flinched, and he gently caressed her.</p>
<p>“It’s sweet.” The man licked at the fluid pouring out of her. Every time he plunged in with his tongue, a deep part inside her trembled.</p>
<p>“You tase sweet and delicious Emma,” he said. “I have no choice but to continue.”</p>
<p>Every time his tongue stimulated her inner walls, her flesh contracted and relaxed alarmingly. Something hot flowed out of her. “Mmm.”</p>
<p>The man continued his ministrations, indulging her. Her body heated up again in passion. His tongue teased her cl*t. He wetted her flesh and swallowed her deeply.</p>
<p>“Mmm. Ah, oh! Ahhh!” she moaned.</p>
<p>“Keep it coming. Emma.”</p>
<p>Her back arched and her hips gyrated as his tongue made her senseless. His tongue dug through her soft, open flesh.</p>
<p>“Your p*ssy is open like this, and liquid keeps gushing out.”</p>
<p>Was it because of his obscene choice of words that even this felt vulgar? The heat rose from her lower region to her cheeks. His tongue dug inside again and then slipped before digging back in, imitating what he was going to do with her.</p>
<p>The strange sound felt vulgar. “Emma,” he whispered her name. The deeper his tongue went, the more she gushed. “Emma, give me some more.”</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>The man persistently stretched out his tongue and continued with his passionate invasion. His tongue slip in and slipped out, only to slip in again. When he did that, it made Emma’s inner parts contract alarmingly. She convulsed.</p>
<p>“Your p*ssy is full of liquid.”</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>As Emma shuddered as her insides convulsed, the man lapped it up with his tongue. He licked every inch of Emma’s skin.</p>
<p>“Ah, ahh.”</p>
<p>When he did that, a thrilling wave of unknown sensation shot down from her waist to the tip of her toes. Then, something long and hard brushed in between her thighs.</p>
<p>“N-no, you can’t.”</p>
<p>He smacked his lips while Emma, who had flinched, looked down at him with a blurred vision.</p>
