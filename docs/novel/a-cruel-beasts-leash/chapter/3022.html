            <p><strong>Chapter 77.2</strong></p>
<p>“You don’t think it’s too weak?” he asked cheekily.</p>
<p>“Hng, hck!” Emma m0aned as a hazy, strange sensation ran down her spine as her nerves tingled.</p>
<p>“Shall I suck and drink it all up?” Irvan asked, his voice deep with want.</p>
<p>As he licked and sucked her wet heat, Emma lost herself in the sensation, it had been a long time since she felt this way. The obscene sound of him sucking on her nectar resounded as er0tic pleasure piled up in layers, and the unbearable sensations rippled in small waves before gradually bursting out in large waves.</p>
<p>At some point, white pleasure spread before her eyes and struck her like a thunderbolt. “Ha, ah, ahhh!” Emma couldn’t hold back and let out a shriek. She was climaxing. Her sweet, hot nectar was pouring down on him.</p>
<p>“Oh, you came first…” Irvan said, looking ecstatic as he raised his head and stared at her gaping hole before straightening his posture.</p>
<p>Irvan embraced Emma, who was dizzy from the after pleasure. He moulded himself over her body. “Ahh!” Emma gasped as he pushed the blunt tip of his penis to the entrance that he had been teasing with his tongue just a moment ago.</p>
<p>“Emma, eat to your heart’s content. Be greedy,” he whispered.</p>
<p>He pushed the narrow entrance with his erect member, splitting her wet folds with his thick hardness. Emma threw her head back at the stimulation. As his thick and hot p*nis penetrated her body, Emma’s sensitive flesh engulfed him sweetly, making his whole length throb.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, like this,” he grunted in pleasure. Emma’s walls clamped around him obsessively.  With hazy eyes, she savoured the feeling of the thick mass digging into her body.</p>
<p>She had some experience with him before, but she was still afraid of how thick and long he was. However, the thick and heavy feeling came to her as a strangely sweet sensation.</p>
<p>“Hu, ah, ahh…” Emma shuddered and trembled all over at the chilling pleasure of penetration.</p>
<p>“You eat quite well,” Irvan said whispered.</p>
<p>The sensation of his huge, thick pen1s sliding through her inner walls was thrilling. He dug through and hit deep within her before stilling. He slowly pulled his pelvis back and thrust back inside with a low groan, and Emma’s body shook slightly as she embraced him.</p>
<p>The touch, feeling, and pleasure felt so good that Emma reached out to run her nails through Irvan’s taut neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>“Hu, haa!” she exclaimed as he pulled her in deeply, supporting her pale hips and waist.</p>
<p>“Yes, tighten up like this…”</p>
<p>Irvan whispered with a low voice as he pinned her to the bed with a firm hand, and grasped her pelvis with the other. <em>Thwop, thwop</em>. The sound of their bodies slapping together filled the room as Emma’s eyes grew dizzy at the sensation of his pen!s hitting and stimulating her sensitive nub, her wet folds and her aching hole. His length slid against her inner walls and dug himself into her so deeply that there was no space left between them. Liquid spilled between them and wet their nether regions.</p>
<p>“I think I’m going crazy,” Irvan groaned. Emma’s body arched to embrace him as he pushed deeper and deeper inside. “You swallow me up nicely,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“Ha, ah!”</p>
<p>Emma exclaimed as he moved his waist faster, causing Emma’s body to shake like she was bouncing. Her insides seemed to melt at the sweet thrill.</p>
<p>“I want to f*ck you like a dog in heat,” Irvan growled, biting her neck.</p>
<p>He pounded into her roughly, filling her inner walls with his manh*od. The feeling was beyond what she could bear; Irvan completely possessed her mind and body with every deep stroke into her core.</p>
<p>“Huaa… ah. Ugh…”</p>
<p>Emma m*aned as he picked up the pace, her body twitched in pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ha, Emma…”</p>
<p>Irvan’s  movements became more frantic as they were nearing the peak of ecstasy; with each thrust, Emma felt like she was being pushed to the brink of insanity, but she couldn’t get enough. She clung to him tightly, her body responding to his every movement.</p>
<p>The sound of flesh slapping against flesh filled the room as they moved together, lost in the sensation. It was too much, too deep, but Emma couldn’t get enough. She wanted more. More.</p>
<p>“Ahh. This is crazy, really,” Irvan gasped as Emma’s body writhed beneath him with his strong thrusts.</p>
<p>“Hu…hck! I like it… so much,” Emma whispered, looking at him with hazy eyes.</p>
<p>Irvan groaned. He grabbed her pelvis roughly and slammed into her deep and hard. They were both intoxicated with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah!”</p>
<p>Irvan’s voice was so s*nsual that Emma felt her core warm even more. She threw her head back and gasped as her already hot body writhed beneath him.</p>
