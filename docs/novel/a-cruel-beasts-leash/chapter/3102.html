<p><strong>Chapter 37.2</strong></p>
<p>Karina thought for a while. “Well, that’s possible,” she acquiesced. “It must be intricate and beautiful items. How do you plan on repaying the rest?” she threw Emma a sharp look at the last question.</p>
<p>“I am ashamed to say this,” Emma mumbled pitifully, “but I was going to ask Irvan. However, the amount is too large as it is… and I desperately want to reduce the amount before Irvan returns.”</p>
<p>Receiving Karina’s contemptuous look, Emma put her hands on her chest and begged. “I beg you, Countess Karina, to be generous and understand my desperate situation.”</p>
<p>When Emma suddenly showed a low profile, people’s attention was secretly drawn in her direction. The attention seemed unwelcome as Countess Karina showed slight displeasure by wrinkling her forehead.</p>
<p>“Such a pity that it involves money.”</p>
<p>The countess, who had caught the eyes of the snoopers, immediately controlled her expression gracefully. As she calmly ignored the eyes of the courtiers with curious looks on their faces, she finally nodded with an unhappy look on her face.</p>
<p>“You tend to act recklessly when you’re young. You’re bound to get into trouble if you spend a lot of money.”</p>
<p>“I will reflect deeply on this and never forget your grace, Lady Karina.” Emma bowed excessively.</p>
<p>“Tsk.” Karina closed her eyes briefly, pretending to feel resigned, and then opened them. It was in fact permission. “I hope it’s smoothly resolved before Irvan returns.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, My Lady, my savior! Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>“Miss Herman, I hope you don’t make the same mistake again.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Lady Karina. I will not. I will be sure to remember that. Thank you so much.”</p>
<p>Receiving a completely hateful glare from Karina, Emma showed courtesy with an unhesitant bow before quickly escaping to the dining hall. When she bolted out of the hallway as if she was running away, her heart, which had been beating hard, gradually subsided.</p>
<p>She was so nervous that she would not get permission! It felt like she had endured a decade of hard labor.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s a success,’</em> she thought. Resting under a pillar’s shade, Emma quietly held a hand to her chest.</p>
<p>It was a reckless improvisation, but thanks to the clumsy image she’d worked hard on during tea time, she was able to get permission safely without being suspected. The situation about the huge debt was of great help. By now Countess Karina must be jumping for joy that she had caught Emma’s weakness. She would naturally be more  suspicious and vigilant.</p>
<p><em>‘I can relax for the time being.’</em></p>
<p>Because as long as the noble Lady Evelyn was inside the annex, there was no need to worry about Collin.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I heard you escape a crisis through Lady Evelyn.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I got lucky.”</p>
<p>“How could it be luck? It’s the result of your quick planning and smart wits. How impressive. I can’t believe you’re relying on Baron Berne, Miss Herman.” Laute rubbed his monocle as he cheerfully spoke.</p>
<p>“It’s because I had no one else to ask for help,” Emma replied.</p>
<p>“It was a very wise decision to involve Lady Evelyn. This way, madam.”</p>
<p>Laute extended his arm and pointed to the entrance as he spoke. Today, he decided to show Emma an alchemy lab and a pharmacy located in the internal investigation hall.</p>
<p>“By the way, did you not find a doctor?” Emma said.</p>
<p>“Lady Evelyn said she has already met a bunch of doctors,” Laute replied.</p>
<p>Lady Evelyn, who’d already spent the past two nights with Emma, was suffering from menstrual cramps. She usually refrained from going out during her menstruation period, but due to Emma’s desperate situation, she was forced to leave the house and spend two nights at the annex of Van Wert Castle.</p>
<p>During their first meeting, Lady Evelyn’s face was pale, and she was extremely untalkative. So Emma seriously wondered if she had taken advantage of Irvan’s position to ask for an outrageous request. She surely would have been offended if Baron Berne had forced her to come to the annex.</p>
<p>But Lady Evelyn later explained to Emma, who had been wondering if she should officially apologize at the given opportunity, her condition through her handmaiden, saying, “Don’t get me wrong.”</p>
<p><em>‘Lady Evelyn started her period yesterday.’</em></p>
<p>From then on, a blanched Lady Evelyn clutched a pillow for two days as she groaned. The maids, who had followed to serve their master, were as restless as a hen guarding a nest as they listened to Lady Evelyn.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Lady Evelyn’s physical condition helped Emma a lot. Her sickly countenance allowed her to not only extend her stay in the annex longer than she had expected, but it was also a good excuse to refuse the countess’ invitation.</p>
<p>Emma was able to relax thanks to the noble family’s love and the protection of the annex. Collin, who was wandering around like a sly wolf, also behaved politely under a mask when Lady Evelyn appeared around Emma. Emma politely expressed gratitude to Lady Evelyn for that.</p>
<p><em>‘Thank you very much for listening to my troublesome, uncomfortable request.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘No, it’s fine. Grandfather promised a big reward. So you don’t have to be too sorry. Rather, I’m so happy to have the items that I’ve been eyeing for some time.’</em></p>
<p>Lady Evelyn spoke as if it were nothing, but as a woman, Emma knew very well how annoying and uncomfortable going through a period was. She was very sorry and thankful. So Emma wanted to do everything she could to repay Lady Evelyn’s kindness.</p>
