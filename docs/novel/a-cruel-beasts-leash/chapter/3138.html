            <p><strong>Chapter 19.1</strong></p>
<p>“Whew. I guess it feels good.” The man abruptly slowed down. Emma flinched as the heat rose up suddenly and grabbed his arms tightly.</p>
<p>“Relax,” said the man as his gyrating waist slowed down.</p>
<p>“You’re extra tight in this position,” he said with a grunt, “it’s making me crazy.”</p>
<p>The wet, blunt tip of his penis filled her narrow insides, and while it steadily pushed through the inner walls the big pillar of flesh weighed down and dug in.</p>
<p>“Mmmmm.”</p>
<p>An indescribable feeling of fullness and tension seemed to explode by his pressing hard. Emma’s lower area was soaked.</p>
<p>Every time he repeated his thrust, his member pressed harder against her. The feeling of pleasure spread from her stretched insides to her chest.</p>
<p>At the swelling of her insides, she exhaled sharply. “Ah, ah!”</p>
<p>Soon after, when her cramped insides were filled, tears began to form around Emma’s eyes.</p>
<p>“You are doing good,” said the man gently, planting his hot lips on her eyes. Meanwhile his thrusts did not stop.</p>
<p>“Ohhh! Ahh!”</p>
<p>Emma groaned. She was feeling overwhelmed by the heavy thing filling her insides. The hot flesh repeatedly rubbed her sensitive parts. All thoughts in her mind scattered and only pleasure filled her.</p>
<p>The rock-hard member pierced her spot. “Ahh!”</p>
<p>Emma shook and moaned at the sensation. His member thrust in and out contributing to her mounting pleasure. Something thick and slippery slid out. She felt as though her body was on fire.</p>
<p>At some point, Emma’s was completely overwhelmed. Her body trembled violently as her walls tightened. “Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>Her thoughts went blank, and she could only see white. “Ohhhh!” Emma sobbed and screamed in pleasure. Her body felt like it was melting.</p>
<p>As if her insides reacted on their own, her walls tightened to the point of suffocation and then loosened dizzyingly; she was overwhelmed by the wave of pleasure that came sharply over her entire body. It was a brilliant climax.</p>
<p>All of her nerves rose and trembled with ecstasy and she could feel everything at once. Everything else became distant. She felt as though she was out of her own mind and body.</p>
<p>“I think I am going crazy,” he said, and his thrusts became frantic.</p>
<p>“Aaargh! Ahh!” Even he was in a state of ecstasy.</p>
<p>Emma was driven to a stronger and deeper climax. “Ahhh!”</p>
<p>The wave of pleasure spread all through her body like a deluge. Her body shivered and arched. Finally, when she reached her limit, Emma’s senses sank to the peak of only blackness as it were shattered.</p>
<p>The brilliant ecstasy floated like a dream.</p>
<p>“My name is Irvan.” She heard him at the edge of consciousness, trapped in a drowsy dream created by the pleasure he gave her. His member, however, dug deeper.</p>
<p>“Emma, who am I?”</p>
<p>“Irvan…” Emma clamped her lips as if they were being controlled by an invisible thread.</p>
<p>“Right. Call me by my name. It sounds good coming from your mouth.”</p>
<p>When his tender invasion crushed her inner walls in a promiscuous and obscene way, his voice heightened her senses. They moved as one.</p>
<p>“Say it, Emma.”</p>
<p>“Ahh… Irvan, oh!”</p>
<p>In the debris of scattered pleasure, Emma’s body gradually sank into a swamp of ecstasy. Their bodies moved together. The sound of their flesh filled the room. She felt like she was gloating somewhere above herself. She couldn’t move or lift a finger.</p>
<p>She had already reached her peak, but she still enjoyed the flesh poking her insides.  “Again, what is my name?”</p>
<p>When Emma didn’t say anything, he lifted himself and rubbed her cl*t with this finger. That sent her reeling. His shaft inside her while his hands touched her.</p>
<p>“Oh, oh, ah, ah!” Emma gasped.</p>
<p>“Say it, Emma.” The tip of his stubby finger stimulated. As his stimulation aroused her, she held onto him for dear life, nervous that her insides would melt away.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah… Irvan!”</p>
<p>Her inner walls accepted him readily. The deeper he went, the more she felt like she would float away.</p>
<p>“Ohh…!”</p>
<p>Her insides were filled with liquid, hers and his, creating a mess. As his finger played with her, her body melted and was remade. Emma shuddered and trembled.</p>
<p>“Oh. Ahhh…”</p>
<p>Eventually, Irvan abruptly stopped moving, pouring out a hot liquid that spurted inside Emma in a hot mess. After having been forced to reach the breathtaking orgasm several times, she was unable to move, but her insides tightened.</p>
<p>His ejaculation lasted a long time. The tightened inner walls held onto him, swallowing him whole. He trembled and groaned as he squirted inside her. Crushed underneath his body, Emma’s lips let out a moan.</p>
<p>The two were completely intertwined, as though sharing one body. The hot sensation seemed to melt both of them. When their body fluids flowed together, their bodies trembled.</p>
<p>“I guess I’m lacking a little. Seeing that you keep tightening down there,” said the man teasingly. The first long and pleasurable wave was not the end but just the beginning of a dense and ecstatic day that would continue until darkness fell.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Emma spent all day enraptured. At dawn, she could make sense of her surroundings. She fell fast asleep. She didn’t know how much time had passed but it was bright outside when she opened her eyes again. She had no idea how long they had been here. Frowning, she drowsily woke up and rubbed her eyes.</p>
<p>The warmth surrounding her body was comfortable. The blazing fire in the fireplace had long since died, not even embers were left. A shirt covered her nude body, but she didn’t feel cold at all because the one who hugged her had enough body heat for the both of them.</p>
<p>Emma was still wrapped in Irvan’s arms. The day felt the same as yesterday, but a whole night had passed and so many things had now changed. She had experienced sensuality for the first time in her life. Half-asleep and drowsy, she tried to make sense of what had happened.</p>
<p>This man, who had refused to introduce himself before, was Irvan. He had become the first man in Emma’s life. At the beginning, it had felt like he was swindling her, but she now knew that that was his sense of humour.</p>
<p>Like he had said, it might have been a problem with time, but Emma felt connected to this man. The important thing was, she was unable to forget. She was unable to forget his beauty in all its nakedness.</p>
<p>Emma shook her head, trying to shake off the embarrassing thoughts. She snuggled deeper into his side for warmth. They had stayed up all night doing…. <em>Is this what kept the human race alive?</em></p>
<p>Irvan’s body felt familiar next to her. Perhaps because they had spent the entire night in each other’s arms, his warmth didn’t feel foreign. He looked cold but his body was emitting so much heat.</p>
<p>Emma who snuggled against him, raised her head to look at him. She could see his beautiful face, his high perfectly sculpted nose, his luscious lips and his perfect jawline. Irvan was asleep and was breathing rhythmically.  However, to Emma, he looked as though he just closed his eyes and wasn’t actually sleeping.</p>
