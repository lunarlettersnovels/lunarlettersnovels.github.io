            <p><strong>Chapter 21.2</strong></p>
<p>“What?” Shocked, Emma blinked fervently as he lowered his hands, which held her hip, and opened her thighs.</p>
<p>“Open up wide, show it all to me.”</p>
<p>“W-what…”</p>
<p>As Emma flinched and shook, Irvan smiled, looked up at the middle of her garden, and stuck out his long finger. Then the tip of his fingers gently spread her folds open. Emma’s body instantly froze. She hadn’t expected to show him her secret place.</p>
<p>“It’s pink.”</p>
<p>Before Emma could even react, Irvan spread her her legs open and made a stark declaration as he peered inside. As she listened to him say that, Emma automatically turned red, like her whole body had been torched.</p>
<p>“A lustful pink.”</p>
<p>Feeling both embarrassed and disconcerted at the way he had mumbled and marvelled at her private parts, she felt an emotion of unknown origin come up to her jaw.</p>
<p>Irvan’s deep, awe-struck eyes scanned Emma in detail as if he were admiring a beautiful piece of art. His eyes roamed her thighs above the water surface to her cr*tch, her chest, her face, and to the tips of her hair. He scrutinized her in detail, the persistent eyes heady.</p>
<p>“It’s the same color as your lips,” he added.</p>
<p>“…” Trapped in his gaze, Emma nibbled on her flushed lips. Her cheeks were hot; her ears burned; her head was mess.</p>
<p>“Even when I suck on it, I can’t believe it’s still a shy, pink color. But if I suck it again, will it turn fiery red?”</p>
<p>Each spot that his eyes landed on seemed to burn under his gaze. Then his orbs headed downward. When his eyes stopped at the center of wide-opne legs, her body began to get strangely excited. Her body slightly shook and her inner walls tightened as if his sight was wnough to caress it.</p>
<p>“Here we have an erotic pink hole…”</p>
<p>It felt like the slippery liquid created by the heat swirling deep inside her body was flowing out on its own.</p>
<p>“It’s pulsating.”</p>
<p>Irvan, who nonchalantly spoke so raunchy, descriptive images, lifted his head. He fixed his sharp gaze upward, faced Emma’s eyes, and slowly opened his lips as he put his head closer.</p>
<p>“Mm.” He raised his eyebrows mischievously, and stretched out his wet towards her wet opening. “It must want to get angry. It’s begging me to lick it quickly.”</p>
<p>Then, his warm tongue made contact with her hole. The tip of his tongue experimentally poked and swirl around. An indescribable warmth seemed to rise from every spot it touched and  Emma’s face soon began to twist in excitement.</p>
<p>“It tastes and looks good.” With a satisfied mutter, Irvan continued to move the tip of his tongue, tasting and teasing her throbbing flesh. Every time he did so, sweet liquid came rushing out to meet him.</p>
<p>“Seeing you shivering and smelling like that, I want to lick and soothe you more sincerely.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” Though Emma bit her lips at those embarrassing words, a moan she had tried to suppress came out. “Oh, yes!”</p>
<p>The inside of her thighs shuddered. Drunk on the unbearable pleasure, she put her two hands over her mouth as a sob began to rise from her throat.</p>
<p>“I guess you can still endure it,” he said as the tip of his tongue skillfully caressed her opening. It climbed up Emma’s flesh, swept above the flower bed, and gently touch the clit*ris upward.</p>
<p>From his brutal tongue teasing, Emma’s back trembled and the tip of her toes shot up. Though her thighs were trembling, Irvan showed no signs of stopping.</p>
<p>“More? Your endurance is amazing.”</p>
<p>What kind of reaction did he want at this rate? She couldn’t think of anything with her head full of pleasure. As Irvan continued his dense playfulness with a provocative tongue tease, Emma, who tried to swallow her moans, shook her head slightly as if surrendering.</p>
<p>“S-stop.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“This is e-embarrassing.”</p>
<p>“You’ve already done everything embarrassing.” Mumbling mischievously, he tapped the clit*ris, which had sprung up with his fingers. It was trembling. “Now, there’s something new.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>He patted then rubbed it with his fingertip. She felt a strong sensation that was different from his tongue; it was both painful but thrilling. When his moist tongue touched her again after making a stake with his elongated finger, a riveting pleasure soared along Emma’s spine and stretched out to the top of her head.</p>
<p>“Ohh! Ahh, yes!” Emma couldn’t hold back her m*oans.</p>
<p>“Now, here comes the good m*aning. Louder,” he said. After pushing his tongue in and pulling it back out, he raised it and bounced it on the clitoris slowly.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Oh.”</p>
<p>Irvan rubbed it up from the bottom then pressed it gently, burying inside Emma’s soft flesh. The pleasure was so unbearably salacious and thrilling. Emma was left twisting her back and shaking her head in ecstacy.</p>
<p>“Stop… Ah!”</p>
<p>Irvan, holding on to her hip tightly, opened his mouth wide and licked her trembling, wet folds whole.</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to stop here?”</p>
