            <p><strong>Chapter 42.1</strong></p>
<p>“Ohh!”</p>
<p>Emma cried as Irvan descended on her with a powerful thrust. The hard tip and swelled member slid through the narrow passage, thrusting in and out of her creamy marsh. The faster Irvan went, the more Emma’s body sank deeper into the bed, struck with a dizzying pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ah, oh, ah!”</p>
<p>It was a feral, hard kind of thrusting that had her fisting the sheets for support. She struggled maintaining upright as Irvan didn’t show signs of slowing down. Thwack. Thwack. Their nether regions soaked with juices collided with l*wd noise, as if someone was stomping in thick, hot mud.</p>
<p>Emma’s inner walls had long been sensitive with every pounding from Irvan’s p*nis. Every thrust or sweet caress was enough to melt her. It seemed that every point of contact his member collided with was unbearably pleasurable.</p>
<p>He pierced deeper, crushing her soft bottom against his hips as an effort to satisfy his greed. Pushing in, sliding out – the process repeated, constantly stimulating the sensitive bumps inside her v*g*na. Then as he gradually increased in speed, it rubbed against her walls harder as she felt herself constrict for him.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Yes!”</p>
<p>Emma felt like her entire body was being devoured. It was impossible to come back to her senses as his fierce thrusting left no inch of space between their bodies. The delicious heat from below felt so hot that it made her eyes water, almost sending her into a daze. The ferocious thrusting was rough and rugged, sleek and sweet. A pleasure that made saliva drip from the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p>“Ahh, ah!”</p>
<p>Her throat was burned hard as she spat out m*an after m*an. At long last, as if surrendering, Emma’s vision became blurry and cloudy, and in the next moment, her vision turned white. Her whole world felt like it was torn apart as a glorious, dazzling climax took over her. A breathtaking ecstasy flooded in, overwhelming her senses that left her shaking in a storm of pleasure from the fingers holding the sheets to her curled toes .</p>
<p>“Ahhh….”</p>
<p>Before long, Irvan, who’d ejected all his sem*n into her cramped hole, exhaled a long, rough breath and pulled his waist back. Emma’s inner walls constricted as the large mass left, squeezing out some of hot sem*n.</p>
<p>“You really ate me up, huh?” he said, chuckling.</p>
<p>Irvan bent his head down, looked closely at her womanhood and his body fluid spewing out of her. He raised his finger to scoop some of it. As he squeezed through the hot hole with his thick finger, the cream and juice that filled her inside dripped down.</p>
<p>Irvan exhaled, caressed her bottom. “Are you satisfied now, greedy Miss Herman?”</p>
<p>“Mmm-hmm…” Emma could only nod dizzyingly from the sheets, her body still shuddering slightly in the aftermath.  Irvan lifted himself off her with a pleased smile on his face.</p>
<p>Emma’s eyes looked through the light that filtered inside the annex hazily. Everything felt distant, as if her consciousness was faintly subdued. The situation outside floated in her mind for a while, but she had no energy to care about it. While Emma was soaking in the thick afterglow of the org*sm, Irvan, who had gone down to the front door at some point, returned to the bed.</p>
<p>“Such a pain. They want us to attend supper,” he grumbled.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I heard that the demon-hunting was a big success.” Countess Karina, who was full of smiles, gave Irvan a gentle smile. “Then there should be no problem for the time being.”</p>
<p>“…right,” Irvan replied with a dry nod of his head.</p>
<p>Tthe countess squinted at his form, took her cup, and stood up.</p>
<p>“Today’s peace is entirely credited to the prestigious Black Knight Order and their master,” she said loudly, commanding the attention of the room.</p>
<p>She raised her glass high as she toasted gracefully to Irvan and the Knight Order. The veterans, servants, bureaucrats  and guests who filled the dinner hall raised their glasses high in unison to praise their bravery and performance.</p>
<p>From then on, the dinner went well. Emma sat next to Irvan, so it was not as awkward as it was at the first time. During the embarrassing first dinner, she’d been alone, but now she was by Irvan’s side. She relied on him as if he were a strong wall; Emma didn’t have to be nervous or scared. She just looked around with a relaxed mind and tasted various foods. The dancers’ performances, the troubadours’ songs, and the clowns’ jesting continued until late at night Emma still didn’t like Collin’s murky eyes drifting towards her from time to time, but she could ignore him because Irvan was around.</p>
<p>Emma tipped her head to Irvan and whispered, then broke into a grin at the clowns’ antics. It was then, Irvan suddenly gripped the glass in his hand and hurled it at Collin.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Collin exclaimed. He had hastily dodged it, so the glass flung at him instead hit the wall and shattered. “Master Irvan, what was that!?”</p>
<p>When Countess Karina’s body shot up as she glared at Irvan, Irvan glanced at Collin. “My hand must have been slippery,” he said.</p>
<p>“Do you think that makes any sense?” Collin demanded furiously.</p>
<p>“It’s possible since I’m drunk,” Irvan replied. He waved his hand towards Collin. “Anyway, that look in your eyes was filthy. I was thinking about how to fix it, when the glass from my hand disappeared.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?” Collin, who’d been pointed out, flew in a rage. “Say it again. How dare you speak that way to your uncle. Ha!”</p>
