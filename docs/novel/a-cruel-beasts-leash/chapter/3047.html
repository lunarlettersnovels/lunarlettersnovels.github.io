            <p><strong>Chapter 65.1</strong></p>
<p>When the intended response came out, the prosecutor concealed his smile of satisfaction. With a grim look, he said, “Then are you saying that handprints were revealed through the purple marks?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Which means the person was strangled before being killed, right?”</p>
<p>Monte nodded in response as the prosecutor’s eyes gleamed like a hyena that had found its prey.</p>
<p>“You can presume that. The marks left on the body do <em>not</em> lie,” Monte said with emphasis.</p>
<p>“Yes…” Upon hearing the witness’s testimony, the prosecution deliberately remained silent for a moment. When everyone’s attention was focused on him, he raised his head and scanned the crowd. “You must have heard all that. It’s terrible.”</p>
<p>The prosecutor turned his head triumphantly to Irvan, but, as if he did not have the courage to look into his eyes, he lowered his gaze slightly and continued.</p>
<p>“This is why this Prosecutor has identified General Irvan as the prime suspect. Irvan and Chairman Collin were the only ones in the bedroom where the incident took place.”</p>
<p>Those who heard the details of the freak incident were noticeably agitated. There was suddenly a clamour among the audience. Yet this was to be expected – The Van Wert court was in a feud; it was divided by internal conflicts. To those who were neutral, it was insignificant, but those who supported the Van Wert family were livid, whereas agreement appeared in the Mun’s faction.</p>
<p><em>‘There is nothing to worry about. Obstacles will be removed soon.’</em></p>
<p>The Mun’s Faction recalled  Countess Karina’s resolve at an internal meeting before the trial. This trial would put Irvan in custody. Then, for the purpose of treating his madness, he would be poisoned with drugs to make him a madman, and if he has an heir after a year, they had planned to eliminate him. Although Collin, who was the mastermind behind everything, had passed away, his plan was working.</p>
<p>When Countess Karina has seized all powers, the Muns would take advantage of the right opportunity to devour Van Wert Castle and the entire Reshire.</p>
<p><em>‘You have to put on the first act properly today.’ </em>Countess Karina clasped her jewelled fingers and pursed her lips. A grand plan must have a well laid foundation. Unfortunately, the last Grok Lodge Project had failed because of the unexpected disruption of some lowly girl.</p>
<p>Countess Karina’s bitter eyes turned to the right side of the courtroom. <em>‘Huh…’</em></p>
<p>Irvan brought only Vice Commander Roham to the courtroom today. It seemed that he did not take the matter seriously as a professional lawyer did not even accompany him. His easygoing attitude would result in serious consequences later.</p>
<p>It was good because she couldn’t stand seeing the stupid girl who stuck to Irvan’s side and flirted with him constantly. She called her ‘Miss Herman’ politely only in front of others, but inside he thought differently.</p>
<p>Karina was originally the eldest daughter of Baron Muns. She was thus deeply sympathetic to her own family. It seemed like a mountain of old grudges had been passed down from generation to generation as they got caught between Count Edner and Van Wert. The Muns suffered the sorrows of being lesser lords.</p>
<p>No matter how much money they had, they couldn’t do anything about power and position. But now… there was a glimmer of hope. Yet a girl no one had heard of suddenly intervened, sprinkling ashes on the almost finished cake.</p>
<p>She had sacrificed two apprentice knights to imprison Irvan at Grok Lodge. Allies who were born and raised in Muland, not in Reshire. It was truly a painful loss. In addition, there were the thirty-five victims who died in the dungeon. Their loyal allies who had been sacrificed for the cause, would not come back to life. The same is true of her twin, Collin. To Karina, he was like her soul mate.</p>
<p>After imprisoning Irvan in today’s trial, Karina would make sure that b!tch Emma would be <em>finally</em> handed over to the prisoners in the dungeon. After a child would be born from the seeds of random men, Karina felt it would be a good year for Emma’s flesh to be torn to pieces, her bones grinded, and sprinkled as animal food.</p>
<p><em>‘Even Collin will be satisfied in heaven.’</em></p>
<p>Karina secretly sharpened the blade of revenge, remembering her younger brother who was unfairly sacrificed. But now, she was in a temporary court set up in an audience chamber. Sadness, not anger, should be expressed at this moment. Fortunately, mourning was easy. Her eyes glistened as she thought of Collin.</p>
<p>“Ugh… how could this be!” Karina burst into tears, a pained expression on her face. She lifted a handkerchief and gracefully wiped the corners of her eyes. “Count – no, <em>Irvan</em> -”</p>
<p>Karina continued sobbing. She called Irvan by his first name, giving the impression that she was taking matters personally.</p>
