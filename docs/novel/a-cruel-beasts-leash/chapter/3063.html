            <p><strong>Chapter 57.1</strong></p>
<p>Collin looked down at his stomach, startled. He had been stabbed. <em>‘A Dagger?’ </em>he thought disorientedly. No, he wasn’t bleeding. There was only a stabbing pain, not a cut or a burning sensation.</p>
<p>“What-what is this…?” As Collin stuttered, his pupils suddenly became hazy. “What did you…”</p>
<p>Emma stood on guard, glaring at Collin. “You better not come close!” she yelled.</p>
<p>“What is this….” Collin swung his hand once and almost staggered. He tried to say something, but words came out of his mouth with difficulty. “You s-stabbed me…”</p>
<p>Collin felt his limbs and his lips became numb as if paralyzed. Then, like a rag doll that had been cut off its strings, he collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s a success!’ </em>Emma held the pipette with a metal needle in a firm grip. Its original purpose was to divide a small amount of liquid into a medicine bottle or to temporarily store it, but the sharp tip was able to pierce through human skin without difficulty. As Collin collapsed helplessly, foaming at the mouth, a crowd of people looked inside with alarmed expectations. They hurriedly opened the door of the prison like a swarm of angry bees.</p>
<p>“Chief Collin!”</p>
<p>“Wake up!”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>There was a big commotion. Emma thought she had overcome a dangerous crisis. Collin was carried out on a stretcher and people rushed out after him. She felt relieved as she was crouching in the corner, clutching the pipette with trembling hands. At last, warmth returned to her fingertips which had become paralyzed from clenching them too tightly.</p>
<p><em>‘I prepared it in case of an emergency… I’m glad I did it in advance.’</em> She exhaled a shaky breath and felt the cold material in her hands. <em>‘I was able to repel Collin with this.’</em></p>
<p>The dungeon where she was left alone, felt desolate. But after escaping through a nightmare, the quiet dungeon felt more of a sanctuary.</p>
<p><em>‘I’m tired…’ </em>Emma was on the verge of collapsing. When her taut nerves had finally loosened, her whole body and neck felt heavy like wet cotton. Perhaps, it was also accumulated fatigue from the previous day. She felt cold; her chin shook. Emma sagged towards the wall and groaned.</p>
<p>She was dizzy and had no strength in her whole body. Eventually, her limbs trembled in exhaustion. Emma crouched down as she felt on the verge of collapsing. She bit her lip as she looked down at the floor like black mud.</p>
<p><em>‘If I just overcome this night safely, Baron Berne will take action…’</em> she thought. There was no way that Baron Berne would just stand idly.</p>
<p>IRvan must have been contacted. He would come forward himself or, if he couldn’t, he would use his influence through Baron Berne to solve this problem. Emma believed in Irvan wholly. Even if she couldn’t trust anyone in the world, Irvan was there. Because of him she could stand firm in the harsh wind and rain.</p>
<p><em>‘I have to wait. Calmly.’ </em>Emma breathed deeply. Now, she wasn’t alone like when she was betrayed by Otto and Dora. She needed only to hold on until Irvan came.<em> ‘I hope this goes on without any further incidents…’</em> she thought worriedly. Tonight was a critical moment.</p>
<p>Time went by slowly. Emma measured the passage of time by measuring the intensity of the torch burning outside the prison. Soon her heavy eyelids lowered. As her vision turned into darkness, she placed her hands together and prayed earnestly in her heart that she could get through this dark nightmare safely. However, it was only a naive wish.</p>
<p>Soon, the silence that engulfed the gloomy dungeon was shattered again. Rusty hinges bolted and hurried, heavy footsteps sounded. Emma’s heart sank when she woke up to the sound.</p>
<p>How long has it been? She hurriedly checked the window. The torch outside was already extinguished. The terrifying night was long and deep, but it seemed that dawn would soon come. Twilight was breaking. Emma shivered from the morning cold. She stood up and stared silently at the door. Her new guests finally showed themselves.</p>
<p>“Chief Collin is in critical condition. They say it’s a symptom of poisoning.” The knight who led the soldiers to the dungeon said, pointing a torch at her.</p>
<p>She took care of Collin but trouble arose again. Not knowing what would happen this time made chills run down her spine. Although her hands and feet trembled with extreme tension and anxiety, Emma narrowed her eyes and counted the figures despite the darkness. There were so many soldiers that it was impossible to count them with both hands. There were three knights instead of one. As the knights from both sides narrowed the distance from Emma as if they were driving a rabbit in the corner with torches, Emma faltered and placed her back close to the prison wall.</p>
