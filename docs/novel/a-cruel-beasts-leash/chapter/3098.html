            <p><strong>Chapter 39.2</strong></p>
<p>“It is bitter.”</p>
<p>“Hah! I knew it.”</p>
<p>Glancing at Laute who’d scooted back exaggeratedly, Emma put back the bottles into a basket. Laute complained that had he known this would be a boring job he wouldn’t have come; but then he added, “Feel free to ask me next time.”</p>
<p>Emma nodded. “Thank you,” she said gratefully.</p>
<p>“For what?” he shook his head, then as he was bringing Emma back to the entrance of the annex, he said, “Oh, Master Irvan will arrive this afternoon or in the evening.”</p>
<p>There was a flicker of surprise and longing on Emma’s face. She thanked Laute as he hurried away, turned around and knocked on the door. Fortunately from here on, she will have no more trouble with Lady Evelyn.</p>
<p>“Miss Herman.”</p>
<p>Zena, one of Evelyn’s handmaidens, opened the door and greeted her. The handmaid’s usual friendly complexion was clouded.</p>
<p>“How is Miss Evelyn’s condition?” Emma inquired.</p>
<p>“Not that good. The symptoms are so serious she cannot move.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I’ll be much help. I went to a pharmacy just now and got some medicine.”</p>
<p>“Medicine?”</p>
<p>The handmaiden glanced at Emma suspiciously. After all, she had already said Lady Evelyn’s menstrual pain was chronic, that they had done everything except surgery. Not only had Lady Evelyn received medical treatment from Monte, the chief physician of Van Wert Castle, but she had also called in numerous locals, alchemists, and pharmacists, but everything they did had no effect.</p>
<p>Emma nodded confidently. “Yes. It’s a medicine specially prepared for Evelyn, so it might work,” she said.</p>
<p>“How should I give it to her?” asked the handmaiden, receiving the medicine bottle with a green-colored liquid.</p>
<p>“The bitter taste is strong, so put two teaspoons of it in lukewarm water and have her drink it every five hours.”</p>
<p>“Understood, madam. Please hold on, and excuse me.”</p>
<p>The handmaiden, after a grateful nod, dug into her pocket and pulled out a tiny mirror. It was a hand mirror with delicate grayish-white patterns.</p>
<p>“It’s silver,” she said, offering no other explanation. Then, the handmaiden poured one or two drops of the dark green liquid onto the silver, checking the toxicity. When the color didn’t change she glanced at Emma, calmly said, “I apologize for my skepticism, but it’s a procedure.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right.” Emma replied.</p>
<p>In fact, she admired the handmaiden’s cautiousness. She always wondered why the handmaiden was carrying a hand-sized mirror. Presently, the reason was clear to her. It was not for vanity of appearance, but for many practical reasons. All for serving her master.</p>
<p><em>‘She said her name was Zena.’</em></p>
<p>As Emma observed the handmaiden, Zena headed for the guestroom to prepare honeyed water. Left alone in the living room, Emma wandered impatiently by the window, waiting for any news of Lady Evelyn. FInally, thirty minutes later, Lady Evelyn called Emma to her room.</p>
<p>“I’ve gotten so much better thanks to you.” Lady Evelyn greeted Emma with a weak smile. There was a bit of glow now to her pale face, which was usually covered in perspiration.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling better?” Emma asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. I think the effects from the medicine you gave me are really good.” Lady Evelyn wiped her sweaty forehead and studied Emma. “Where did you find the medicine?”</p>
<p>“From a pharmacy. In the castle.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I have heard that a highly skilled doctor resides here. A graduate of the royal academy.”</p>
<p>It was obvious why she had only heard the rumor and hadn’t asked around about it. Layna was employed by the Muns family. Emma, an outsider, would have noticed Count Limon’s deteriorating health and the suspicious relationship with Karina and the castle employees. They must have been on high alert inside and remained furtive with their operations.</p>
<p>“Thanks to you, my pain is relieved,” Lady Evelyn said. She smiled faintly at Emma. “By the way, aren’t there any side effects if I drink the medicine too often? It makes me suspicious that it works so well. Though, of course! Zena has already checked it.”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. It has the same effects as painkillers and cramp medicine. It has components that can help blood circulation. Your body won’t have any aches if you drink it every five hours.”</p>
<p>A joyful look passed Lady Evelyn’s face. “I’m alive, but it sometimes hurts so much. When pain comes, it feels like someone is crushing my hip with their hands. Sometimes it even feels like someone is banging a hammer on me.”</p>
<p>Emma listened to Evelyn speak with a soft smile on her face, reached into her basket and pulled out the medicine bottles. There were four.</p>
<p>“These will be enough for the meantime,” she said, offering them to Lady Evelyn.</p>
<p>“Oh! These are all for me?” she asked in wonder.</p>
<p>“Yes. They’re all prepared for you, so I have no other use for them.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my! Thank you, greatly! You’re so kind and generous.”</p>
<p>Lady Evelyn was so happy with the thought that the next menstrual cramps wouldn’t be as painful anymore. She could almost jump for joy if she still weren’t that weak.</p>
<p>“By any chance, if I run out… may I ask you for more?”</p>
<p>At her question, Emma’s expression became slightly troubled. Emma was in fact just a stranger, a temporary guest. She wasn’t even certain if she would stay in Van Wert Castle next month. However, despite her situation, she was unable to reject, faced with Evelyn’s  earnest gaze, so she had no choice but to nod.</p>
<p>“Yes. However much you need,” she said, realizing she meant it. “I really want to repay you for your kindness to me, Lady Evelyn.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Lady Evelyn said, finally settling down. “I won’t forget your kindness.”</p>
