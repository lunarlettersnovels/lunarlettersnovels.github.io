<p>She was held by him as he passed through the hallway, until the sofa appeared right in front of them. After gently setting her down onto it, he spread her thighs and put his weight on her to join their warm bodies.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I’m not sure which one will work better…” he said, his amorous gaze never leaving her flushed face as he filled her once again. Emma’s folds were in full bloom as they wrapped around his throbbing penis. Despite their previous engagement, his thick shaft hadn’t lessened in size, and still filled her narrow whole hungrily.</p>
<p>“What’s better… my spit, or my dick?” He kissed her temples as her inner walls enveloped against him tightly, shaking, almost devouring him. Her insides lubricated with saliva and their body fluids audibly smacked against his hot pillar.</p>
<p>“Emma… which is better?” he whispered, his voice low and hard. Emma couldn’t answer him except with a moan, or a whimper. She overwhelmingly crushed by pleasure, and the feeling of it was so good that Emma was out of her wits.</p>
<p>At this new position, each leg folded to the side so his weight rested on her filly, his thick shaft filled her completely, hitting her sensitive spot that brought her mind reeling, her body shaking. With every strong thrust, his movements seemed to speed up with the thrilling pleasure that ran long along their crushed bodies.</p>
<p>“Ohh! Ah!”</p>
<p>An indescribable joy bubbled inside her when the shaft of his thick, throbbing member rubbed against her inner walls. Then at one point, when it was deeply embedded inside,  touching the deepest spot as if it were taking root, a flash of ecstacy struck Emma like lightning.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>Irvan chuckled as Emma squirmed beneath him. Did he want to drive her insane with his teasing? But Emma couldn’t refute, other than an occasional “Oh!” or “Ah!” She merely held his forearms in vice grip as she rode out her umpteenth org*sm.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief.”</p>
<p><em>Slam!</em></p>
<p>All of the sudden, the tightly closed door opened wide. Her eyes, hazy from their lovemaking, jerked wide towards the now open front door. Several people were standing in the doorway. Unfamiliar people. And among them were three women as well.</p>
<p>“Ahh!” Emma screamed in shock, unable to think of what to do next. Irvan, who had swiftly withdrawn his member from inside her, frowned at the disturbance before sighing briefly. Without another word, he lifted Emma and returned to the bathroom with her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“It’s a wreck out there. Is everything okay inside?”</p>
<p>An old man named Miller asked. He was wearing a stiff uniform without a single wrinkle and had a businesslike but still polite expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Uh,” Irvan lazily nodded. “It’ll be messy.”</p>
<p>While the old man straightened his back a hard and formal posture, Irvan on the opposite side sat comfortably leaning against the sofa.</p>
<p>“Did you clean it all up?” the old man continued.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir. I am in the middle of it,” Irvan answered. The way he talked was distinct from the older folks. There was obvious arrogance.</p>
<p>He had briefly washed up a little while ago and there obvious annoyance as he swept the still wet tips of his hair tickling the bridge of his nose back. Fortunately, unlike before, he was wearing a shirt and some pants, but he had left his tie loosened.</p>
<p>Irvan didn’t bat his eyes when he spread his long legs comfortably across the stiff seated man before him. He had a fairly arrogant and snobbish attitude, but no one inside took issue with that. Rather, it seemed like the guests were being cautious.</p>
<p><em>‘Careful?’ </em>Emma thought pensively, studying the two men before her.<em> ‘More like fear.’</em></p>
<p>Emma could almost taste the faint emotions lingering in the air. It was not fear but <em>horror</em>. The people’s faces were frozen stiff, diligently paying attention to Irvan’s every move. There was a general consensus between them that if they made even the slightest wrong move, they’d be decapitated or scolded.</p>
<p>This old man named Miller, who to Emma seemed like the man in charge, looked very surprised to find two naked people before, but he soon schooled his expression; the same went for the people behind him. The three women with them stole glances at Emma as if they could not suppress their curiosity. However, it was not an imploring, gossipy look.</p>
<p>Everyone, including Miller, was dressed in neat uniforms as if they were high-ranking servants. Glancing at their organized and restrained posture, they emitted an air of good discipline.</p>
<p><em>‘Are they aristocrats?’</em></p>
<p>Although they were dressed up nicely, Emma had no choice but to think they were nobles since their uniforms didn’t seem to be bureaucratic. This was, after all, a cabin owned by some noble.</p>
<p>At this point, Emma became curious about Irvan’s identity.</p>
<p><em>‘Strange.</em>’ She studied the people who had barged in out of the blue as she fell deep into thought. <em>‘Is Irvan not the cabin keeper?’</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt suspicious about Irvan’s identity, which at first she was convinced of. He didn’t have the mannerisms of a servant nor did he treat his guests as his masters. The guests didn’t even ignore Emma, who sat right next to Irvan.</p>
<p>Despite her shabby appearance – She had hurriedly put on underwear and clothes – no one pointed out that fact. If a strange woman like her suddenly took over a noble’s cabin and settled down, they might ask her to leave so they could talk privately with Irvan. Worse, they could kick her out with demanding orders, but they didn’t even dare to try such a thing.</p></div>
