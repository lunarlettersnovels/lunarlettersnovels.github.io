            <p><strong>Chapter 71.2</strong></p>
<p>As if response to his er*cti*n, her body also flared up. Her wet bottom squeezed as shivers ran all over her body. Emma blushed at the feeling, and her thighs closed involuntary. She squirmed underneath him.</p>
<p>Irvan grinned. “Are you excited?” he said.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You lie well with such indecent eyes.”</p>
<p>As Emma pursed her lips, Irvan’s strong hands grabbed her knees and opened them wide. Emma jerked in surprise as his thick thumb grazed over her und*rwe*r.</p>
<p>“You’re wet…”</p>
<p>Irvan’s voice was low and seductive. He pulled down her wet p*nties, freeing her nether region. He stared unabashedly at her womanhood. Emma was embarrassed, but his gaze made her wetter.</p>
<p>“You’re excited.”</p>
<p>“… It’s sweat.”</p>
<p>Emma responded, shying her face from him when she felt her body betray her and became wetter. Irvan’s mouth curved up.</p>
<p>“Is sweat this sticky?”</p>
<p>After saying that, he pushed his body towards hers. Emma immediately felt his thick and hot pillar atop her wet petals. Irvan skillfully took her underwear off and rubbed her petals with his member. As she felt his hot skin obscenely touching her, she trembled.</p>
<p>“Does sweat smell this good?”</p>
<p>He continued teasing her. Emma’s heart thudded against her ribcage. “… It’s because I eat and drink nice things,” she replied cheekily. “I also do. Then do I also smell nice?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“How good? So good that you want to be <em>banged</em>?”</p>
<p>Emma’s heart was caught in her throat. She was soaking wet all the way to her pubes. He poked the tip of his member inside her hole.</p>
<p>“Like this?”</p>
<p>“Ohhh…”</p>
<p>Emma m*aned. His wet tip slowly pushed inside of her and then out. His slippery head pushed against her clitoris and Emma could feel the breath knocked out of her lungs.</p>
<p>“Can you feel me? I was sweating in excitement too,” he said. “I’m sweating lewdly too.”</p>
<p>He angled his hot member that was teasing her clit*ris and rubbed his length down the opening of her wet hole. Emma felt her clit*ris being squished it sent an immense amount of pleasure to her nerves.</p>
<p>“It’s same here…”</p>
<p>Irvan continued. His hot tip kept teasing her vagina.</p>
<p>“Ha… uh..!”</p>
<p>“It keeps on sweating as I rub it. It smells good too…”</p>
<p>As he slowly rubbed his length against her womanhood, warm juice spilled from her hole, soaking her entire petals. She shivered uncontrollably. Her hole kept contracting and spilling thick liquid out.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“There’s more sweat coming out from this hole.”</p>
<p>Emma’s face flared up like a tomato as Irvan continued mercilessly teasing her. Now she regrets what she said.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to do more?” he whispered.</p>
<p>Before Emma could reply, the hand that was caressing her waist firmly grabbed her hip. He positioned her bottom in front of him and angled his erect member towards her glistening hole.</p>
<p>“Feels like it’s hungry.”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>His head that came into her hole was swallowed smoothly.</p>
<p>“It’s nibbling me…”</p>
<p>“Ah! Huk!”</p>
<p>Emma hugged Irvan’s back and m*aned as her insides contracted and devoured him like a hungry snake.</p>
<p>“Eat it more…”</p>
<p>Irvan grabbed Emma’s hips so she couldn’t move and thrust his m*nho*d even deeper. They both m*aned at the sensation. As her insides contracted around his thing as if squeezing the life out of it, Irvan let out a long sigh and grabbed Emma’s hand.</p>
<p>“Is it eating well?” He locked their palms together. “How’s the taste?” he asked.</p>
<p>At his teasing, she felt his member come in even deeper. Her back arched in reply.</p>
<p>His entire length slid into her wet cave. Her walls clung around it desperately as her body shivered. Her hole greedily sucked a thick pillar of meat.</p>
<p>“How’s the taste? Is it good?”</p>
<p>“Hut!”</p>
<p>As Emma panted and m*aned from the thickness that filled her inside, Irvan smiled in satisfaction and continued to penetrate deeper.</p>
<p>“It’s probably not sweat, but saliva. It’s chewing and swallowing me well.”</p>
<p>His thick swelled harder as Emma’s insides wrapped around it. More juice came out from both of them.</p>
<p>“Ahh.. now it’s spilling. How is it?”</p>
<p>With that, his waist started moving faster. The pleasure they both felt at the sensation was immeasurable.</p>
<p>Irvan grunted. “Is it good..?” he whispered as he skillfully moved his hips and clashed their bodies.</p>
<p>“Hut! Mhh! Uh….”</p>
<p>“Do you want more?”</p>
