            <p><strong>Chapter 20.1</strong></p>
<p>Sure enough, he was awake. As if he had felt her endless staring, his blue-gray eyes slowly opened and shifted towards Emma. The usually cool eyes above his well-defined nose were no longer cold or scary to her.</p>
<p>“Are you awake?” he mumbled.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she answered. Had he been waiting for her to wake up?</p>
<p>Irvan’s eyes staring down at Emma were slightly squinted, giving an impression of a wolfish, mischievous look. “Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Right,” he teased. “You slept soundlessly like a princess under a spell.”</p>
<p>“And you Irvan?”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>A long, thick finger caressed Emma’s back. Soon the flesh underneath his roaming slightly tickled. “Well…” While Emma’s body was bare and defenseless, Irvan’s long finger sneakily touched the secret gap between her pale thighs. “Who can fall asleep at such a moment?”</p>
<p>Emma clamped her legs shut with a shake of her head. “It stings,” she complained.</p>
<p>Perhaps feeling sorry for her, Irvan soothed Emma with his caress. He  sweetly whispered into her ear, “That’s because it was our first night. It happens during the first time.”</p>
<p>“Ugh,” frowned Emma. “You knew this whole time? It wasn’t even one time.”</p>
<p>“Ohh, is that so?” Irvan replied.</p>
<p>When Emma sulkily pouted her lips, Irvan played it off innocently. A low laugh rumbled from his chest. “Then did you count how many times we did it?”</p>
<p>Emma felt unsure. Had it been four times? Or five times? Since she had fallen asleep somewhere in the middle of it, that was all she could muster from hazy memory.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she answered dejectedly.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed. I was hoping you’d tell me, as I submitted myself diligently.”</p>
<p>“You what?”</p>
<p>As soon as Emma’s face turned a tad sulker, Irvan lifted a finger and lightly brushed her lips. “What a pretty but dissatisfied face,” he began impishly. “Oh, whatever shall I do?”</p>
<p>A cheeky smile was on his lips as he said that, further infuriating Emma more.</p>
<p>Then he proposed something even more absurd. “Even if we continue now, you won’t be able to remember where you counted up to. Why don’t we start all over again from the first time?”</p>
<p>Emma stared blankly at him after clearing her throat. “You must have had a record of the most you’ve <em>done</em>, right?” she began slowly, not meeting his eyes. “How many times did you do it… with other…?” she faltered.</p>
<p>“Why do you think that?” he said from above her.</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>Because he was so good at it, was what she secretly thought. But when Emma was unable to say what was on her mind, and merely blinked owlishly at him, Irvan chuckled.</p>
<p>“I guess I was so good that it satisfied you. Right?” he answered.</p>
<p>Emma bristled. She felt she needed to knock down his pride down a notch. “…it was just painful.”</p>
<p>His smile even got widder. “That can’t be. Then who made all that moaning that I heard all night?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“It was so erotic,” he whispered, his voice low against her skin, “as if I was melting like butter. I heard something so clearly, so lustful it would even make a monk’s d!ck stand erect.”</p>
<p>Emma closed her mouth, a furious blush making itself known in spite of her muteness. She didn’t say a single word to retort his playful, mocking words. Then, a soft smile lit up Irvan’s face.</p>
<p>With bright, blinking eyes, he said to her, “Relax. Because I don’t have any record of that.”</p>
<p>Emma blinked at him. “Huh?”</p>
<p>“It was my first time, too,” he divulged. “If we are really going to make a record, I think we’ll have to count over again. And for that, I think I will need this beautiful lady’s—” he came nearer to her, “—cooperation for this erotic secret.”</p>
<p>His dazzling smile almost dazzled Emma. Unbeknownst to her, joy blossomed deep inside her heart.</p>
<p><em>‘How could it also be Irvan’s first time?’</em> She thought disbelievingly, yet, she didn’t even realize that the corners of her lips had risen to the heavens.</p>
<p>“But young lady, you liked it way too much.”</p>
<p>As soon as her gaze met Irvan’s eyes which bore something else beyond playful mischievousness. Emma shyly lowered her eyes, cracked down on her inner thoughts, and hurriedly lifted herself from the sheets. When she was about to release herself from his warm, tempting arms, a large hand reached out and grabbed her wrist, pulling her back in. In an instant, his arms were around her waist, locking her in an embrace.</p>
<p>“Where do you think you’re going?” he whispered.</p>
<p>“T-t-to the bathroom.”</p>
<p>When Emma became flustered at his tantalizing murmur, his handsome lips twisted into a gentle, but wicked smile.</p>
<p>“Don’t think about escaping even for a moment,” he said so, with an air of deliberate arrogance, and a satisfied look on his face. “Do not leave my sight without my permission. You are mine.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Emma foolishly stared at him. Irvan, his eyes set into a lazy slant, slowly said in a low but clear voice, “It’s a legitimate demand as your lifesaver. I saved your life, and you are mine thanks to that,” he said childishly.</p>
<p>“…until when?” Emma replied, a deadpan expression on her face.</p>
<p>“Until I let you go,” Irvan replied innocently.</p>
<p>Now that she thought about it, she had begged him last night that she’d do anything for him if he saved her. As a result, she was safe, so Irvan’s argument was not wrong… Irvan had risked his life and protected her from her enemies, and even defeated a terrifying werewolf. On the other hand… she also liked it.</p>
<p>“I got it. Now can you please let my hand go?”</p>
<p>“No,” Irvan declined in a whiny voice, hugging her waist even tighter. Emma was deeply absorbed in his strong body because of that. Then, she could feel something warm and wiggly poking around her thighs and gen*tals.</p>
