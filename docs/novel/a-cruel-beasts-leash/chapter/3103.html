            <p><strong>Chapter 37.1</strong></p>
<p>Baron Berne studied Emma with leveled eyes. “My granddaughter happened to get her clothes tailored at the boutique. When was that?” he began.</p>
<p>Emma’s head quickly shot up. It was important to match the timing with the words he uttered. “…four days ago, Lord Berne.”</p>
<p>“That is right. You and my granddaughter met by chance four days ago.”</p>
<p>“Yes. In the boutique.”</p>
<p>“And from then you’ve gotten along, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Emma nodded enthusiastically. The thin lifeline that Emma had prayed for began to materialize before her. As expected, Baron Berne had years of experience with such matters even with his granddaughter.</p>
<p>“Your granddaughter and I get along well and have much in common.”</p>
<p>Berne had given Emma a clue with great difficulty, so she had to snag it at once and hang on to it.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” he continued. “There were some things that she liked among the items you’ve ordered, Miss Herman. Even the dress you’re wearing is a design that she probably likes.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I have many. Even dress shoes, brooches, and decorative bands,” Emma replied immediately.</p>
<p>Since she hadn’t actually met Baron Berne’s granddaughter, it was advantageous to list out things that didn’t need body measurements. Moreover, ready-made products were better.</p>
<p>“That is right.” Satisfied with Emma’s smooth reply and quick understanding, Baron Berne said with a gracious smile,  “Oh, my granddaughter’s name is Evelyn. There is a reason she has to meet you again. A reason that <em>cannot</em> be ignored.”</p>
<p>“I…” Emma’s brain quickly rolled into motion again. “Evelyn let me borrow some money at the boutique. I didn’t have a single coin to my name, and there were so many things I wanted to buy. Irvan has given me plenty of presents, but human greed has no end. However, I couldn’t shamelessly ask her for more. There were things I wanted that no one else knew.”</p>
<p>“I see. I can understand since you are young. Our Evelyn must have gone to Master Irvin and lent the money for you. How much did she let you borrow?”</p>
<p>Emma quickly calculated. “50,000 teaks. I borrowed it under Irvan’s name.”</p>
<p>She purposely said a considerable amount. 50,000 was no small feat. With that amount, a lady can buy two luxurious dresses, and can rent a decent small house for a year if one resided in Summerville.</p>
<p>“I see. But did you think twice about it when the things arrived?” Baron Berne continued.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of things I bought on impulse that didn’t suit me. Rather, I thought that it would be nice if she came in person and I exchanged some of the debt in kind. Since there are things that she said she liked,” she answered smartly. “Irvan just so happens to be away.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she nodded. “ It is a really good chance. The annex is vacant, so we can even become acquainted.”</p>
<p>“But Miss Herman, you are a guest in Van Wert Castle.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Baron Berne was skilled. After gazing in the air for a moment, Emma immediately found the answer that the baron wanted.</p>
<p>“…that’s right. That’s why I need permission from the countess.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. Then, I will wait here.”</p>
<p>Baron Berne nodded with a faint smile on his face. Contrary to what he’d said openly, however, he called the horseman over to order something in secret. It seemed to be a message saying to rush over to the mansion and to bring Evelyn.</p>
<p>“I will go get the countess’s permission now, Lord Berne. Please wait for a bit.”</p>
<p>“Please take your time. Don’t run. Since there is plenty of time to save face.”</p>
<p>While Baron Berne waited in front of the door with his cane in his hand, Emma hurried back to the dining room, lifting her dress with her fingers. Thankfully she was still in the same spot from earlier. She noticed Emma appear through the doorway and quickly threw her a glance and turned away while she was surrounded by her close aides.</p>
<p>After taking a deep, slow breath, Emma moved towards the countess, deliberately making a desperate expression.</p>
<p>“What is it, Miss Herman?” the countess asked with a raise of her eyebrow.</p>
<p>Emma asked the countess for permission, then whispered briefly in her ear. “I have something I’ve been wanting to say, Countess Karina. I…”</p>
<p>Countess Karina looked grim after hearing Emma’s story. “Is there a proper reason why today has to be the day you invite a guest?”</p>
<p>Her intense glare was fixed at Emma. At that, Emma made the most pitiful and embarrassing face.</p>
<p>“I kept this a secret from Irvan. And the stuff arrived yesterday, and I was out of my mind, so happy to open them,” she began. “It wasn’t until today that I started to worry. And tomorrow is too late! The stuff arrived yesterday, and since I recklessly opened them, they won’t be new tomorrow… If I want to get the right price, I’d better deal with them by the end of the day. Lady Evelyn may change her mind.”</p>
<p>“How much was it again?”</p>
<p>Nodding, Emma replied, holding her breath. “I am ashamed to say this, but it all cost 50,000 teaks.”</p>
<p>“Ohh…” Karina hummed curiously, demanding Emma’s caution. “So generous for such a young girl.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lady Karina. About that, I heard something from Baron Berne on the first day. What happened that time was called a ‘reimbursement’. Thinking about it again… I was very foolish. I guess I was caught up in the moment of extravagance and splurged on luxurious items…”</p>
