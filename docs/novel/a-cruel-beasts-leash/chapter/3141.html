            <p><strong>Chapter 17.2</strong></p>
<p>“I can’t taste this?” The man smiling wickedly did not stop teasing her with his tongue.</p>
<p>His lips above Emma’s wet gen*tals rubbed against her skin. Then, the gap in his open mouth widened, and a moist wet tongue stretched out and pressed over the clit*ris as if stroking it. When the hot tongue flexibly stimulated every corner of her gen*tals, her vision blurred with heat, and an indescribable pleasure poured out, pulling her into a dream-like state.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hard thing that touched the hole below gradually pushed inside.</p>
<p>“Ahhh, no…”</p>
<p>Emma, who opened her eyes thinly while sunken in s*xual pleasure, shook her head helplessly.</p>
<p>“It’s my finger.”</p>
<p>“Ohh, ah, ah!”</p>
<p>Emma grabbed the man’s hair and arched her head back as the tongue rubbed hard over her cl*toris. His finger opened her up and her back arched as the man went in deeper.</p>
<p>As Emma’s cl*toris was stimulated with his tongue and her vag*na was touched by his finger, her insides filled with longing for the climax, tightened to the fullest, and the excitement that suddenly reached its limit exploded.</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>At that moment, her slender waist shook and twitched helplessly. Her inner walls convulsed rapidly, and a hot and sticky liquid poured out from inside her.</p>
<p>“Wonderful!” he said. The lips and chin of the man lifting his head from between her legs were wet and shiny. He gently caressed her to soothe her.</p>
<p>“Mm. Oh!”</p>
<p>Emma felt something. She faltered at the blunt and hard thing that was distinctly different from his soft tongue. The man straightened his torso and pushed his body closer against her. He had taken of his clothes and his bare skin touched her body.</p>
<p>Soon, Emma, who had become eroded by dreamy pleasure, blinked to clear her vision as something hot, hard and blunt poked at her opening. It slipped inside her slippery hole and probed as though to find the right angle.</p>
<p>“I’m going to do it,” he whispered in her ears. At that moment, something huge, pierced inside at once. Her insides swelled up in an instant.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>It was as though a huge stake had been planted in the center of her body, her insides were spread wide, and the thing entered deeper and deeper. Emma’s body half interconnected with the burning rod. She couldn’t make a noise.</p>
<p>It felt as though her body was split into two with a large chunk of flesh firmly embedded through her middle. Immediately after, a searing pain shook her to the core, and she winced trying not to cry out.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah…!”</p>
<p>Her entire body felt the shock of it. Her body suddenly froze at the feeling of the thing inside her. For a brief moment, she was not able to move. The unbelievably stiff, unfamiliar and terrifying thing penetrated further and stopped momentarily. It hurt like hell.</p>
<p>This violent, brutal thing was incomparable to the man’s finger. While Emma felt like she had been paralyzed, the thick, hard thing passed through her tightly squeezed walls and filled her up as if it were going to take root. She was already wet, but the man’s member that pierced her tight insides was so wide and heavy that she wanted to stop.</p>
<p>“Ah! Oh! Ah!”</p>
<p>As Emma clenched her jaw to endure the pain, soft kisses trailed from her sweaty forehead to her nose, ear, and cheek. All the while, the man slowly fitted his body deep into hers. And at last, he reached a point where he could no longer go deeper.</p>
<p>“Ahh.”</p>
<p>The man who had dug to the end, stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>“Relax,” he said. He gently hugged her and caressed her while she trembled because of the pain, blinking back tears, “They say that the first time usually hurts.”</p>
<p>Emma blinked in shock. <em>First? Did he say first? But… what about last night? </em>She opened her mouth in disbelief. “Did you say <em>first </em>time?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the man, shuddering with his member still embedded inside her.</p>
<p>Through their tightly connected bodies, Emma was able to read each faint tremor in detail. The pulsation that spread from the huge thing deeply embedded conveyed the tremor in Emma’s body.</p>
<p>“Y-you fraud!”</p>
<p>“What?” The man’s lips curled up wickedly as if he was enjoying the moment.</p>
