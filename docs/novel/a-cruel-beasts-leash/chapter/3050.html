            <p><strong>Chapter 63.2</strong></p>
<p>“Two, you will testify. You will be paid well for it. Roham.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“How much would you receive for an opportunity like this?” When asked, Roham stroked his chin as if considering it. “If it were me, I’d take the price of a house in the downtown area of Reshire. Isn’t Mr. Irvan wealthy? It’s an opportunity to make a fortune. With that money, I’ll never have to worry about eating for the rest of my life.” At Roham’s answer, Irvan looked back at the maids.</p>
<p>“You heard him. I will pay both of you that much for betraying your master. You can move or continue to live with that money. The same goes for your children. Whether you’re going to give birth and raise them or abandon them. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>The maids looked at each other, then carefully hugged their bellies and raised their eyes towards the back. It was the yard where their children’s father died. It was clear that Countess Karina wouldn’t take illegitimate children. She may even harm them because she doesn’t like Collin’s seed in women’s stomachs. They knew the type of person Karina was, and it was a losing battle to be hopeful she would save them.</p>
<p>Their anxious gazes flitted side to side as they thought of a decision. Finally,</p>
<p>“I d-dare to ask w-what kind of testimony we should give…?” As soon as the black-haired maid finished saying it, she fell flat on the floor. Similarly, the blonde maid bowed her forehead and expressed her will of submission.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>While Roham was guarding the drawing room, Irvan took Emma up to the second floor of the annex. There, he hugged her tight in his arms.</p>
<p>“Emma,” he called her softly, his voice filled with longing and heartache. Emma buried her face in his wide, firm chest.</p>
<p>“Irvan…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. You had a hard time because of me.”</p>
<p>She certainly had a hard time. Last night was a hellish nightmare she never wanted to go through again.</p>
<p>Emma lowered her eyes and took a long breath. When his refreshing body scent enveloped her whole being, she suddenly felt safe and okay, like a sunny morning that comes after a strong storm passes. Irvan was unharmed, and so was she. She didn’t want anything else. If it wasn’t for Irvan, her life would have ended in that mountain lodge anyway. Every day felt like a blessing. Irvan was there too, so there was nothing more she could wish for.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you again, Emma,” he began.</p>
<p>Emma looked up to him. “Yes?” she replied.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you afraid of misfortune?” As Irvan’s soft voice sounded over the top of her head, Emma remembered he said the same words back at Grok Lodge,  <em>‘Aren’t you afraid of misfortune? Isn’t it possible that knocking on this door would cause misfortune?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘They say anger doesn’t go around alone. Things were bad today, but something worse could be waiting for you. Misfortune may be followed by injustice and misery.’</em></p>
<p>Recalling everything he said, Emma murmured, hugging Irvan even closer,”If the injustice and misery you warned about at that time are the Muns’ siblings, then it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“So you remember…” Irvan lightly stroked Emma’s hair.</p>
<p>“Yes, I didn’t know at the time, but I’ve experienced it and I know it now. And Irvan,” she lifted her head to look up at him.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>When their eyes met, Emma smiled softly. His blue-gray eyes, which remind her of a glacier when they first met, no longer felt cold. Rather, it was like a comfortable house in an icy country, endlessly warm and cozy. Irvan had always been like that. She was always reassured and protected when she was with him.</p>
<p>“Since Irvan has dispelled all my misfortunes and saved me from anger, I want to pay him back. I’ll get rid of all the injustice and misery following misfortune and bad luck,” she solemnly said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want that.” Irvan smiled playfully. ““You’re trying to get rid of the debt you owe me, huh? I’m so obsessed with you, but you’re making an excuse to run away.”</p>
<p>His thought was so unique that for a moment Emma blinked blankly, then burst into laughter. “No, never,” she said.</p>
<p>“How can I believe that?” Irvan looked down at Emma with a stern look on his face, but the corners of his mouth were turned upwards.</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s see, it’s a one-time repayment. Irvan saved me twice, so it’s okay.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, is that so?” Irvan furrowed his brows as if contemplating. Emma hugged him tightly and rubbed her face against his chest.</p>
<p>“Of course. So give me a chance to repay you.”</p>
