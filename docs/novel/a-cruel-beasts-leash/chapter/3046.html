<p>“Did you really have to commit such a terrible thing…!? Collin is your maternal uncle. Yes, I was well aware that you usually don’t get along because you’re not related by blood. Since you were a child I hoped that one day, kindness would manifest. I was even thinking of marrying you to Miss Herman, even though it’s not fair – just for your happiness. How could you harm my only brother?”</p>
<p>Countess Karina cried despondently, wiped her face with a handkerchief until her nose turned red. She had decided to put aside her usual dignity and elegance, and did not hesitate to show a pitiful appearance. Her shoulders shook with bitter sobs of sorrow.</p>
<p>She felt no regret for Irvan, but only anger that had accumulated; the will to deprive him of his successor position dominated Karina.</p>
<p>Then, when the tears stopped flowing, she squinted and shot a sharp glance at the prosecutor and the judge. Crying forcibly was exhausting and took a lot of energy. She had meant them to finish it before it gradually became boring.</p>
<p>The prosecutor, who had been fed a lot of money, loudly exclaimed and puffed up his belly like a poisonous toad. “Dear Judge! The prosecution pleads guilty to the murder of Count Irvan Van Wert!”</p>
<p>“I have an objection!”</p>
<p>Roham suddenly stepped out, surprising everyone. He stood in his seat and looked around the crowd and calmly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“This is only the unilateral argument of the prosecution. Everyone saw Chairman Collin fall from the window. It is clearly a tragic result of what he <em>alone</em> has done to himself.”</p>
<p>“How about the purple spots left on his neck? The handprints were clear. A corpse doesn’t lie! Even if you don’t trust Mr. Monte, you can call in another doctor to do an autopsy. It will have the same result.”</p>
<p>In response to the prosecution’s counterattack, Roham exchanged glances with Irvan and calmly opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Is it undeniable evidence that the purple spots remain on the body?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>The prosecutor nodded confidently. Without this kind of evidence, he wouldn’t have started from the beginning. As the inquisitor inwardly scoffed and narrowed his eyes at Roham, the latter opened his mouth. His strong expression matched the aura of a seasoned knight.</p>
<p>“Is there any evidence that the handprints belong to Irvan?”</p>
<p>“Ah…?” The prosecutor owlishly blinked for a moment, before answering in a loud voice. “Of course, at the time of death only Mr. Irvan and Chairman Collin were present inside the room! The day before, Chairman Collin had collapsed from the shock of the Werewolf incident. He was recuperating in his bedroom the whole time.”</p>
<p>Roham nodded and skillfully spoke,  “I know. Everyone in the castle is well aware of Chairman Collin’s<em> actions</em>. But speak outright – I’m asking if there’s any direct evidence that Irvan strangled Chairman Collin.”</p>
<p>The prosecutor shook his head as if finding the matter absurd. He turned to the judge.</p>
<p>“Dear Judge. Vice-President Roham’s argument is a tautology. I believe it is not worth responding to.”</p>
<p>The judge looked at Vice Commander Roham with a solemn expression and said, “Vice Commander Roham, please make your case based on facts.”</p>
<p>“It is a fact-based claim.” Roham did not back off and continued to speak firmly. “Because Irvan wasn’t the only one in Chairman Coliner’s bedroom at the time.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Did you mean the Chairman’s servants and bodyguards? At the time of the incident, they were all out of the bedroom.” The Prosecutor waved his hand and smirked. “And you’re saying they’ve strangled Chairman Coliner’s throat? To death? You’re claiming Irvan was framed?! Hah!”</p>
<p>“No. I am not talking about them.”</p>
<p>“All right, who is it? Are you speaking falsely in a solemn courtroom now?”</p>
<p>When the prosecutor was done taunting him, he furiously shouted, “Judge, Vice Commander Roham is insulting this court with inappropriate remarks! We object! It’s speculative.”</p>
<p>“It’s a presumption!”</p>
<p>“It is? Then what is the basis for making such an absurd claim!?”</p>
<p>During the heated discussion, the eyes of the audience turned to Roham and then to Irvan.</p>
<p>Irvan was always expressionless, as if it had nothing to do with him. His appearance was very similar to that of his royal-blood mother and his father, who was a warrior by birth; thus, he was manly and had a beautiful face like a statue, but everyone admitted that he was not befitting as the next Lord of Van Wert Castle. This was because he was cold and cruel.</p>
<p>Irvan did not show any gentle qualities that could convince the people of the Holy Land. He was neither magnanimous, kind, generous, nor tolerant. He was more akin to a warrior, or, even, a murderous mercenary who waged war without conscience, rather than a wise and firm lord in charge of Reshire.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Countess Karina, who sat on the throne even with stuffy eyes, was the ideal and virtuous lady that everyone dreamt of. She was kind, generous, and attentive. Her elegant and beautiful appearance was a bonus. In fact, in the past five years she has been acting as a Deputy Countess, everything was stable, so the people of the Holy Land have been supporting Countess Karina from the start. In their hearts, Karina was ‘Lord’, and not just the Deputy Countess.</p></div>
