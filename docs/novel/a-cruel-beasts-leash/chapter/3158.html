            <p><b>Chapter 8.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. The people who Otto mentioned as escorts are just armed robbers. They were hired to threaten and kill me.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Emma, who noticed a change in the atmosphere quickly sorted out her thoughts and added rather broken sentences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…I didn’t know, but now that I think about it, they must have thoroughly conspired and prepared in advance. There was a crossroad along the Gwando Island to Polaville, but they decided to choose the smaller unknown path that led to a quiet valley adjacent to the mountain range…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s definitely a crossroad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Emma nodded at the man’s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Ferragen Mountains are notorious for their rough mountains. I heard that if the weather is gloomy like today, usually people would stay at the nearby station. Usually, they wouldn’t hasten the process, but I simply thought our schedule was urgent, so I went along with it.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma turned her tear-filled eyes towards the man and the man’s blue-gray eyes became thinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am coming to realize that everything that seemed so urgent was just a big plan after all. Please save me.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man remained silent for a while and slowly turned around with an expression that he had heard enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma constantly looked at the man’s wide back, swallowing back hot tears and trapping the despair rising in her throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man stretched out his bandaged fingers and opened the tightly closed door viewer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sure you heard about the werewolves that appear a lot in this territory, especially in this forest. How many guards did you bring?” the man unexpectedly began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? Um…” Expecting something else to come out of the man’s mouth, Otto reacted somewhat slowly. “Fi..fiv… No, we have three.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto quickly fixed his words. It was a clear and obvious lie. Emma chewed her lips in bitterness. The number of guards she saw while running away was definitely well over three. The brightly lit torches alone were more than five. To be honest, there could have been way more.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Three is not enough. You have underestimated Ferragen Mountains.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, no, what do you mean it’s not enough? Although few, they are well-trained soldiers to cope with any crises.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From what troops are these soldiers in?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That, that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto hesitated, caught off guard by a detailed question. Then Dora, filled with impatience, finally intervened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are soldiers from Somerset. They are famous for their clean work and good skills, so we often hire them as escorts. They’re very famous people in our region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was definitely a lie. Emma, who grew up in Summerville, never heard of such soldiers. It was clear that Dora made it up thinking that people living in Ferragen Mountains were too deep in the mountain to notice the outside world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I guess they weren’t very useful. Seeing that they neglected their beloved lady,” the man openly voiced his cynicism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto closed his mouth knowing that there was nothing to say back. The same went for Dora.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s night and strong winds abound. Even if you go back to the carriage, you won’t be able to move. I’m sure you will need a place to avoid the rain. Why don’t we talk about this when tomorrow comes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the man tried to end the conversation with a lazy look, Otto seemed to be caught off guard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? B, but….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s an empty warehouse over there. You can use it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How can we trust you and leave our lady here?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otto was mad at the man’s one-sided conclusion. Dora also blurted out in rage, “Yes! You look young, we don’t know what you can do to our lady!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never said your lady was here with me. What’s the reason for assuming such a thing? I find that quite offensive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s… that’s….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get lost.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticized, the man tried to close the door viewer unpleasantly, rattling Otto. “Young man!” Otto demanded, “What are you going to do about our lady!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man sighed tiredly, “I guess my quiet night is going to slip away. I hate being loud. First, go to the warehouse. I’ll be out in a little while, so I’ll talk to you separately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After his last words, the man closed the door viewer without hesitation and turned coldly. Behind his back, a banging sound rang out as if protesting, but the man was expressionless. He looked like he didn’t care at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He strode to the sofa and sat down, while Emma blurted out everything she had in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s all a lie. There is no such thing as the ‘Somerset soldiers. They are just a gang of armed robbers. What I mean is, that it’s dangerous. You should never go outside and talk to them like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to Emma, high on anger, the man raised his head expressionless and pointed at the kitchen of the hallway with his fingertips. “Drink.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?” Emma stood dumbly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Water. You said you were thirsty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was weird to see such a calm demeanor in an emergency, but Emma was assured that the front door was shut tightly. No matter what happened outside, there seemed to be no way of breaking in.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same was true for the iron bars as well, which seemed to be designed to prepare the cabin for monsters. It too looked solid and difficult to remove even if armed people banged against it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The window was also completely blocked, only able to be opened if experienced craftsmen came along and used professional tools on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s probably why he is so relaxed.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Emma, who swallowed her nervousness with a short sigh, stood with her arms folded, as a dull echo continued from the front door. ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, two, no… three or four?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering that the knocking now was different, Emma deduced there were about six or seven people outside. Everyone seems to be rushing and knocking on the door, but the voice outside could not penetrate the front door and could not invade the silence of the room.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma, who got to her senses, raised her head and glanced towards the ceiling. There was a gap where light leaked out. Perhaps it was open for ventilation. But because the indoor sound insulation was so thorough, Emma assumed something must have been installed to block the noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are persistent.”</span></p>
