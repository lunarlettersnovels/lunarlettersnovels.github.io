            <p><strong>Chapter 40.2</strong></p>
<p>His stiff tip poked through her opening as Emma’s waist wrapped around his large, strong arms was slightly lifted. As his member and her nether region came into contact, a l*wd sound slightly echoed. In response to his excitement, Emma was also wet.</p>
<p>“D*mn,” Irvan cursed, his grip on her becoming stronger. “I guess you felt the same way.”</p>
<p>Instantly, he closed the gap between the moist flesh and his throbbing member. The narrow tip of Irvan’s rod entered past her wet petals, earning a gasp from Emma. His member that buried deep inside Emma’s core was as hot as a rod of fire.</p>
<p>“Oh, ah!” Emma m*aned. As soon as it met her deepest part, her waist slightly shook as a dizzying, burning pleasure seemed to undo her.</p>
<p>“Did you miss me this much?” Irvan exhaled roughly.</p>
<p>He tensed his body and lifted her from him. Then, Emma’s inner walls were filled with an extreme sense of mass again, his heat coming in and filling her lower abdomen.</p>
<p>“Oh… yes! Ah!”</p>
<p>Emma let out a faint m*an at the overwhelming pleasure from the insertion. When she grabbed on to him, his huge upright member glided smoothly through her tightly clamped inner walls. Thwack. Thwack. Her inner walls, engaged with the skillful movement of Irvan’s waist, repeatedly contracted and relaxed.</p>
<p>“It’s hot,” he whispered. As the long, erect rod whipped and devoured her wet inner flesh, her insides tightened around him thrillingly.</p>
<p>“Yum, yum…  Bite me. Welcome me. You’re in a fever of excitement,” he continued.</p>
<p>Emma felt dizzy. “Oh, ah, ah!”</p>
<p>“Whew… you take it well.”</p>
<p>At the exhilarating moment in front of her, Emma felt faint, shaking her head helplessly. The s*xu*l excitement was so obvious. As Emma’s inner walls tightened out of their own volition, they gushed with liquids her aroused state.</p>
<p>“You said you want to swallow it some more.” Irvan gripped her slender waist and deeply thrusted inside her, crushing her wet, wide-open petals.</p>
<p>Emma trembled slightly, m*aning. “It’s t-too, ah…”</p>
<p>“It’s so good…”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah!”</p>
<p>The stimulating sensation of his erect member gliding down her melting insides was enchanting. The veins on Irvan’s rod were thick and pulsating, so she could vividly feel it going inside and outside of her. As the soft inner walls surrounded his pulsating, thick shaft, honey-like liquid spewed from outside of her.</p>
<p>“I can’t take it any longer,” Irvan groaned, “you’re hot and tight.”</p>
<p>As the friction grew, the liquid that flowed out as she clung to him thickened like cream.</p>
<p>“Yes, ah! Oh!” Soon enough, her seductive m*aning began to fill the room. A peculiar, l*stf*l voice.</p>
<p>“How er*tic. You’ve gotten naughtier during our time apart.”</p>
<p>Emma clung to Irvan as her voice made an unbelievable sound. Perhaps because of their current position. With him raising her bottom and dropping her back where his shaft came all the way to the tightest part of her, her vision felt distant for a moment.</p>
<p>As they were deeply locked in an embrace with Emma’s arms around his neck, Irvan paused to peel her dress off over her head, as if it was bothering him. In an instant, the n*ked woman’s chest was presented to him.</p>
<p>“Ah-ha. How have <em>you</em> been?”</p>
<p>Irvan’s tongue then swirled around her bulging mounds, and when he poked up inside her, Emma twisted her body and gasped sweetly.</p>
<p>“Ohh, yes!”</p>
<p>Their wet nether regions were deeply intertwined, the thwacking sound and thick, throbbing member gradually built pressure on her inner flesh, which trembled as if it were convulsing.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Emma.”</p>
<p>Fighting against the pleasure, Emma gripped his shoulders desperately, her knuckles turning pale.  The more she fought, the more her insides felt entangled and bursting.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, ah…!”</p>
<p>Every time his angry member thrust up, the clear liquid soaked in pink flesh flowed down like foam. The juice that flowed down the pillar of flesh fell er*tically, soaking the sofa. The stimulation of continuous penetration was too strong, too deep. Emma’s inner walls trembled, her jaw shuddered, and a tingling sensation spread through her as the firm and long rod crept in and out. A whiteness suddenly spread over her vision; Emma was seized by a mind-numbing ecstasy. Thwack. Thwack. She squeezed around him with all her might; he stimulated her wet, trembling  inner walls, picking up the speed.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh!”</p>
<p>After a series of pounding, Emma reached the highest peak of ecstasy and exclaimed sens*ally.</p>
<p>Knock. Knock. Suddenly, a knock on the annex’s door shattered the amorous excitement in the room. At first, Emma thought she’d heard something wrong, but when she heard the clear echoes again, she was not mistaken.</p>
<p>“Uggh!” When the sudden uninvited guest appeared, she jumped up in surprise and covered her mouth with her hands. “Someone must have come,” she said, panting.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Irvan said offhandedly.</p>
<p>And as if neglecting the situation outside, he lifted Emma and laid her down on the sofa, grabbed her ankles, and spread her legs. And in that position, he started to press his weight down on her and in one fluid thrust, he was inside her again. Thwack. Thwack.  As soon as he started to move his waist ferociously, there was a tremendous sense of pleasure that assaulted her senses. While Emma covered her mouth and her back curled in pleasure, the knocks continued at the door.</p>
<p>The person outside still  hadn’t gone away. Perhaps there was a strange excitement from the impatience of hurrying and anxiety that someone standing outside might hear their l*vemaking, her wet flesh turned hotter and tighter around his thick p*nis, and a series of amorous sounds echoed across the room.</p>
<p>“Ah… mmh..!”</p>
<p>Emma could not think of anything besides covering her mouth as Irvan penetrated her whole being, rubbing long against her hot inner walls, striking deeply into her inner core. She just let out a barely-restrained m*an.</p>
