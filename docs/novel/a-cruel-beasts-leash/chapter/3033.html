            <p><strong>Chapter 72.1</strong></p>
<p>“You have to finish swallowing me,” Irvan whispered.</p>
<p>It was too much. She felt that his member was too thick and big and wouldn’t fully fit into her cave. Her inner walls tightly wrapped around him desperately.</p>
<p>“Huk! It’s too…”</p>
<p>Emma grabbed ahold of his arms like a lifeline, dazed at the simulation. Irvan started moving his hips faster.</p>
<p>“Too what?”</p>
<p>With a forceful thrust, his hard length slammed to her deepest part, earning a gasp from Emma. His member slowly slid outside her walls, then went inside again. With every hot stroke of his manh*od, Emma’s inner walls felt electrified. Her vision slowly turned hazy as he continuously penetrated her depths. Only the l*wd sound of their wet regions slapping together filled her ears.</p>
<p>“Delicious?”</p>
<p>“Uh..! Mhhm…”</p>
<p>As Emma’s m*ans became uncontrollable, she covered her mouth. Irvan felt devilish and moved his finger atop her sensitive cl*t. With masterful fingers, he rubbed and poked it in tune with his deep, long thrusts. Emma’s body shivered and jerked.</p>
<p>“Now, be good…”</p>
<p>“Ha, mm…!”</p>
<p>An intense wave of ecstasy crashed upon her. She was melting, becoming wet with every gesture of pleasure that he basked her in.</p>
<p>“You’re me swallowing well…”</p>
<p>Irvan’s tantalizing voice sounded far from her ears. Her back arched at the pleasure, her legs widened giving him more room to drive into her hard. Her walls squeezed around his member l*stfully, as m*ans kept escaping from her lips. He played her body with his fingers and manh*od and she couldn’t get enough of him.</p>
<p>“Keep going. Swallow me until the end.”</p>
<p>Each time he came inside her warm, melting cave, his thick pen*s thrillingly scoured the deepest part.</p>
<p>“Ha! Ah! Huk!”</p>
<p>She m*aned and gasped as an immense amount of pleasure swarmed within her. His erect and throbbing member crushed her insides and swirled her juices around as her cl*t was deftly stimulated by his fingers. She was so wet inside that his member smoothly slid and conquered her inner walls.</p>
<p>“You’re doing well…”</p>
<p>Every time his fingers touched her cl*t, her inner walls contracted densely around his member, increasing the ecstasy she felt with every second.</p>
<p>“Ha! Ahhh! Ah!”</p>
<p>“Ha, Emma…!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Irvan went inside her so deeply that her body trembled uncontrollably. Her womanho*d finally swallowed his whole length. She didn’t think it was possible. She felt dizzy, as if stars were exploding in front of her, but her bottom was filled with spasms of electricity.</p>
<p>Each time his thick p*nis went inside her and stimulated her inner walls as it came out, her nether region felt like it was on the brink of release. She panted as he passionately penetrated and teased her insides, her petals. It felt like she was losing her mind from all the pleasure.</p>
<p>“Haaaaa!”’</p>
<p>Finally, her inner walls that clamped around his aggressively moving p*nis made him spill white cream inside of her. Irvan grunted as he thrust his member to the deepest part where his seed and her juices became a sticky mixture. The pleasure was too sweet… so much that she couldn’t think.</p>
<p>For a while, Irvan was still, breathing heavily and observing her. “Is it tasty?” he said, his voice huskier than before. Emma shivered in reply, still overcome with pleasure. “You taste so good I want to have a second serving.”</p>
<p>Emma m*aned as Irvan slowly inched his member out, then came inside of her again to begin another round. She was so sensitive that she shivered with every slow stroke that stretched her to the brim, and her lower region throbbed like an incoming storm. She couldn’t handle the second zenith of the pleasure that went through her body.</p>
<p>“Ha… ah.. mhm…”</p>
<p>Even if she felt faint, Irvan didn’t stop. He slowly moved his waist and guided his manh*od to fully imprint himself deep inside her creamy cave. Emma shivered with his every deep contact, she felt her inside was being taken apart. Then changing tempo, he slammed inside her with enough force that the sound of sticky slapping skin echoed.  Emma shivered in pleasure as Irvan ramped up his speed and force of penetration. His penis came in quick and deep, throbbing and hard as it filled her with pleasure inside.</p>
<p>“Uh! Huk…”</p>
<p>Sweet nectar spilled from her hole as his entire length was submerged in her wet juices in her inner caves. Irvan touched and spread her wet petals.</p>
