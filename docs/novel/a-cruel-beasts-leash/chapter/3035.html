            <p><strong>Chapter 71.1</strong></p>
<p>She would’ve died in that stormy night; her life had only been spared thanks to Irvan. He was her only sanctuary when she was trying to recoup from all the wounds she got from the betrayal around her. That alone should be enough.</p>
<p>She could only be grateful of Irvan’s existence and remember these precious memories with him. As Emma collected her thoughts and dug herself into his embrace, Irvan hugged her tighter.</p>
<p>“Seems like you have a lot of thoughts,” he said.</p>
<p>Emma was quite surprised. She hid the sadness in her voice. “Does it look like that?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Mhm.”</p>
<p>Emma shook her head. “I wasn’t thinking about anything.”</p>
<p>His comforting hands were warm and nice. She felt calmed as she was surrounded by his firm and large body. <em>‘This is stability,’ </em>she thought. It felt like time had stopped, with Irvan’s calm breathing the only thing she could hear at that moment.</p>
<p>No, it hadn’t stopped. She <em>wanted </em>it to.</p>
<p>As the worries were eating her away, her face was lifted with a gentle motion. She slowly blinked at him.</p>
<p>“Emma,” Irvan called.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“It feels wrong that you’re not thinking about anything in this state. I was thinking about you.”</p>
<p>Emma was taken aback. She stared at him hard. As their eyes met, Irvan grabbed her chin and kissed her. Lips overlapped with each other for seconds. Her body shivered in anticipation.</p>
<p>“Hmmm-”</p>
<p>Irvan kissed her passionately. It was hot that a cold man could have such passion inside of him, and for <em>her</em>. She returned the kiss as eagerly, pulling him closer. Irvan slowly wrapped his arms around her waist. He laid her on bed and pushed himself atop her.</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t have succeeded without you,” he murmured, caressing her skin with his hands.</p>
<p>The pressure from his firm muscles felt wonderful and Emma could only shiver with every touch. Most of all, she was glad that Irvan was thanking her.</p>
<p>“…. No, I’m happy to help in any way,” she replied.</p>
<p>“You’re so modest. You should want a big reward. Do you need anything?”</p>
<p>Irvan moved his lips from her mouth to this side of her face. He bit her earlobe and kissed her neck as his hands continued stroking her body. She could feel a delicious warmth spread down her lower body.</p>
<p>“Ahh.. nothing,” she sighed, eyes fluttering close.</p>
<p>“You’re so determined. Tell me anything. I’ll give it to you.”</p>
<p>Irvan continued to kiss her skin as if he was hotly imprinting on it. The soft kiss that started at her ears continued down her neck and to her collarbone.</p>
<p>“Ha…. No. I won’t be able to do that. I’m the one who’s desperate for you.”</p>
<p>Irvan dug his face into her collarbones and took a deep breath. “I want to do it.” Intense gray eyes stared at Emma. His hazy face made her feel ticklish inside.</p>
<p>“Can I? I really want to,” he said again.</p>
<p>It was the face he never showed anyone while he was staying at the Van Wert castle. Only to her, he showed his defenseless, childish whining.</p>
<p>“How long…?”</p>
<p>“All night.”</p>
<p>Emma gingerly touched his cheek. Irvan took it as consent. He slowly took off his clothes; his thin shirt was quickly discarded to the floor. The familiar set of his shoulders and hard muscles greeted her sight. As she saw his masculinity, her heart started beating.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at?” Irvan laughed.</p>
<p>“You’re amazing…”</p>
<p>His body was like an art but the scars here and there made her remember that he was human and alive.</p>
<p>“Are you going to keep looking at me l*wdly?”</p>
<p>“…. Yes.”</p>
<p>Emma mumbled in spite of herself as she stared at him.</p>
<p>“Until when?”</p>
<p>“Until I get sick of it. I want to keep looking at you if I can.”</p>
<p>Irvan chuckled and took his pants off next. Emma took a deep breath as she looked down at his m*nhood. Her eyes widened. How was it so big and thick? The size of his erect pillar amazed her every time she looked at it. She was astonished that something so huge could go inside her and leave no wounds.</p>
<p>Was it the mystery of the human body? Or providence of the creator?</p>
