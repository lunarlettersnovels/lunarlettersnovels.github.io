            <p><strong>Chapter 34.2</strong></p>
<p>“…everything,” mumbled Emma, who pretended to think deeply for a moment as she munched the food in her mouth.</p>
<p>Karina straightened her back, as if she was shocked. her voice held disbelief as she asked Emma. “Everything?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Emma nodded shamelessly. She didn’t forget to make an awkward smile by clearly revealing her teeth.</p>
<p>“That’s a shock, Miss Herman. But now that I think about it, Irvan is <em>wonderful</em> with no flaws.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I think he’s really amazing and perfect,” said Emma with pure admiration in her face.</p>
<p>Immediately after that, Karina’s eyes turned cold as subtle laughter flowed from around her.</p>
<p><em>‘I have to look as ditzy as possible.’</em></p>
<p>Karina’s tea time was scheduled for tomorrow, and it seemed that Emma would be caught up with her until Irvan returned. Karina was superior in every way, in an overwhelming position, and Emma was just a humble, worthless commoner to her.</p>
<p><em>‘It’ll be damaging if I face her directly.’</em></p>
<p>For this reason, Emma wanted to look stupid on the outside. She thought it would be easier if she pretended to be a pretty young woman whose naivety could be seen at a glance.</p>
<p>She decided to take it a step further by enthusiastically praising Irvan. “The moment I first saw Irvan I thought he was a prince right out of a fairy tale. He was thoughtful, kind, sweet, and even brave! I fell in love with him at first sight.”</p>
<p>Emma praised all aspects of Irvan so much that she sounded like a fanatic who obsessed over Irvan.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it scary when he fought the werewolf?” Karin asked coldly.</p>
<p>“It was scary, but even that moment was dazzling! It felt like my heart would beat out of my ribcage!”</p>
<p>When Emma blushed and gazed at the air with a dreamy look, Karina, who looked gloomy, emptied her wine glass. For a while, Karina doubted Emma’s natural appearance and she persistently inquired her. Emma answered smoothly with her made-up persona. She looked surprisingly fine, but truthfully, she could feel a screw was slightly loose inside. But the jitters helped her act out the appearance of an unpredictable young woman.</p>
<p>As the dinner progressed, performances by troubadours and clowns continued in front of the podium. The guests who finished most of their meal shifted their attention to the stage. Perhaps even Karina was tired of the fickle conversation, that she also diverted her attention to the performance.</p>
<p>The room was filled with people’s laughter and conversations as they enjoyed the silly humor of the clowns on stage.</p>
<p>Emma could finally catch her breath. However, despite the relief of having overcome a crisis safely, the faitgue she felt was immense. Throughout the entire dinner, she was in tatters trying to remain alert and constantly behaving contrary to her nature. Her entire body was now tired and drowsy, so she didn’t even want to move a hand.</p>
<p>So Emma didn’t even bother to look at the performance and only focused on resting. Soon after the performance ended, the drunk attendees got off there seats and loittered around the hall. There was a carefree atmosphere prevalent inside the dining hall.</p>
<p>Emma was scanning the surroundings, trying to find a chance to escape. But it wasn’t easy to find a way out since Karina’s acquaintances kept talking to her.</p>
<p>“They say that sugar-coated nuts are popular on King’s Island. By chance are they popular in Summerville as well?” one asked.</p>
<p>“No. Tree cakes are popular in Summerville. It’s a snack layered like rings on a tree trunk…”</p>
<p>As Emma continued to make random sounds in her pretentious voice to answer the annoying questions, a glass was suddenly shoved in front of her eyes.</p>
<p>“I want to toast to our precious guest.” It was Collin, whom she’d briefly encountered earlier today. He had a grin on his red face. Emma dubiously wondered if he had been drinking elsewhere.</p>
<p>When she blinked slowly at him, he winked with one eye and smiled. “I told you I’d be pleased to see you. I am really glad.” He handed a glass to Emma after filling it with a pumpkin-colored liquid. “I offer this drink to you, such a beautiful woman. I hope you accept it, Miss Herman.”</p>
<p>The fishy look in Collin’s smile had insidious energy. The alcohol was not wine but distilled liquor, and the smell was fragrant, but it had a terrible scent of strong liquor at the base.</p>
<p>“Come o,” he urged when she remained motionless. “Are you going to ignore my sincerity? I was thrilled to see you. I think I’ll be sad if you embarrass me.”</p>
<p>“…O-ka-kay,” Emma stuttered, unable to fully conceal the shivers. As she accepted the glass, excited eyes were focused on her again.  “I can’t handle liquor well.”</p>
<p>She muttered it like an excuse. Then she took a short breath and tilted the glass to her mouth. But in reality, she wasn’t drinking the liquor, but pretended to do so. She faked a cough next. And along with the exaggerated cough, she spat out the alcohol, staining her dress.</p>
<p>“Oh! Excuse m-me!” Her face blanched as she looked down at her stained dress before standing up from her seat. At the same time, she cried with embarrassment, unable to control her emotions. “What should I do!? This is a new dress!”</p>
<p>Stomping her feet as she fretted over it, she decided to take this opportunity to leave the dining hall.</p>
<p>“My precious dress…! I must excuse myself. Please understand my situation.”</p>
<p>Emma showed courtesy to Countess Karina and Collin by bowing at the knee, then she immediately turned around and bolted from the dining hall.</p>
