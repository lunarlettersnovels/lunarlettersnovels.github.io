            <p><strong>Chapter 67.1</strong></p>
<p>“W-what?”</p>
<p>“You’re correct. These two strangled Chairman Collin.”</p>
<p>The court was suddenly in chaos. The gavel was slammed to calm the court down.</p>
<p>“Silence! Please focus on the trial.”</p>
<p>The people became silent. The prosecutor, who panicked for a moment after Roham’s unexpected claim, looked at the report and then glanced at Countess Karina. Countess Karina glared at him with an order to never surrender and just keep marching on.</p>
<p>“Eh, then…” The prosecutor licked his lips and continued. “Your claim, vice commander Roham, is that these two maids were the one that murdered Chairman Coliner and not Irvan?”</p>
<p>“No. I told you many times that Chairman Collin brought it upon himself,” Roham replied.</p>
<p>“Then how do you explain the wound on his neck?” The prosecutor asked.</p>
<p>“That’s more of Chairman Coliner’s <em>personal</em> affair….”</p>
<p>As Roham purposely didn’t specify, the prosecutor urged him. “This is to reveal the reason for his death. Only the truth is required and his personal affair cannot be an exception.”</p>
<p>“Mm, it might be very sensitive for the deceased if I reveal it. Your honor?” Roham gave the decision to the judge.</p>
<p>The judge realized that it was a trap set by Irvan’s side and wanted to stop, but as many were watching and Bishop Albert was there, he couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Please continue for the fair trial,” In the end, the judge compiled.</p>
<p>“Okay. Since you allowed it, I will reveal it.” Roham took a deep breath. Everyone went silent. As the court got quiet, Roham finally continued. “Truthfully… These two maids had an <em>explicit</em> relationship with Chairman Collin. You had a physical relationship with him but used meal serving as an excuse. Isn’t that right, Miss Heather?”</p>
<p>“… Yes.”</p>
<p>As Heather answered looking scared but still sounding honest, everyone was talking amongst themselves. The prosecutor received a death glare from Karina, and he immediately stood up. “Objection! This is an irrelevant statement.”</p>
<p>“No. Quite relevant. As Chairman Coliner’s taste was quite unique. So…” Roham touched his forehead as if this was difficult. He sighed and then spoke. “The Chairman apparently asked to be choked from time to time. And that morning was the same.”</p>
<p>As Roham said this, the prosecutor was almost out of his mind. “This is ridiculous! There’s no proof!”</p>
<p>“Why do you think there’s no proof?” Roham was calm. He looked at the prosecutor disappointedly like a teacher teaching a foolish student.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Roham pointed at two maids as the prosecutor stared at him all flustered. “There they are.”</p>
<p>“T-they are not! These witnesses were placed here by Commander Irvan’s side. It’s likely that they were swayed!”</p>
<p>“No. Not at all. They hold marks on their body that will prove this testimony.” Roham cut him off clearly. His loud voice shook the court. “They are both pregnant. And Chairman Collin is the father.”</p>
<p>Someone drew a quick breath and coughed at Roham’s statement. The prosecutor had nothing left to say. Roham brought in Monte again at this chance. Monte looked around uneasily after standing at the witness stand.</p>
<p>“Mr. Monte. Please tell us truthfully as the doctor of Count Van Wert castle. Is the hand mark left on the deceased’s neck a man or woman? I’m also going to testify with another doctor after his claim.”</p>
<p>Monte gulped nervously as Roham said this threateningly. “…. I don’t know that much. I just checked that it was a human hand on the neck.”</p>
<p>Monte trembled while answering. It was so different from his calm demeanor before that people wondered what was going on.</p>
<p>“Then it might be a mark left from enjoying a sexual act?”</p>
<p>“…. It’s possible.” Monte shut his eyes and mumbled.</p>
<p>“Can you check whether these maids are really pregnant at this moment? I’ll call another doctor if you can’t.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
