            <p><strong>Chapter 33.2</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps Miller noticed her thoughts. “Miss Herman. If you need some assistance I can call a maid,” he offered.</p>
<p>“I’m okay,” said Emma, shaking her head no.</p>
<p>At best, Irvan had moved her to the annex to get away from the interference of the castle, but the castle’s people could not be brought here. Because it was certain that whoever came in would become the countess’ eyes and ears.</p>
<p>“It’s all right. I can do it,” she said.</p>
<p>“Understood.” As if he’d expected that from her, he didn’t ask twice and slowly nodded. “Then I will come to get you before dinner begins so you aren’t late, madam.”</p>
<p>After all the people who surrounded the quiet annex escaped, Emma, who was left alone again, felt hopeless as she looked up at the boxes piled up in the middle of the living room. She was clueless as to what to do with all of them, but she had to do something. There wasn’t much time left until dinner.</p>
<p>It would be nice since it was hosted by Countess Karina. All the key figures inside the castle must be present.</p>
<p><em>‘They say that the first impression is important.’</em></p>
<p>Emma would have to introduce herself in front of a bunch of unfamiliar faces. So she had to choose clothes that fit her somehow and dress up nicely.</p>
<p>“Whew.”</p>
<p>After a deep sigh, she ambitiously rolled up her sleeves as she took a step toward the mountain of boxes.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“The dining hall is on the right side of the banquet hall.”</p>
<p>At the servant’s guidance, Emma stepped forward with trembling feet. Her stilettos clicked and clacked on the marble floor, and the bottom of the dress decorated with a lace brushed her heels.</p>
<p>She felt odd. Because she had never even thought in her dreams that she would walk in a resplendent dress through the halls of a castle owned by an aristocrat.</p>
<p>Following the servant, she saw a reflection of herself in the large wall mirror hanging in the hallway before turning a corner. Her well-groomed hair hung neatly over her shoulders, and the pearl headband slightly tilted over her forehead went very well with the ivory dress.</p>
<p><em>‘My hard work has paid off.’ </em>Shifting her gaze from the mirror, Emma proudly squared her shoulders with a pleased smile on her face.</p>
<p>Overall, she had chosen an elegant and calm design, but there was a problem. It was that her collarbone was fully exposed. The bold exposure was somewhat of a burden, so if she didn’t consciously straighten her body, people could almost see her cleavage.</p>
<p><em>‘It was an inevitable choice.’</em></p>
<p>Emma’s eyebrows gathered as she recalled the difficult process of choosing a dress.</p>
<p>The pile of clothes Irvan had sent ranged from casual clothes to pajamas, and even accessories for each type. After contemplating for a long time, she had chosen a simple, elegant banquet dress. It was acceptable, as no matter how neat and simple the design was, it was made with meticulous care and skill fit for an aristocrat.</p>
<p><em>‘But the top half exposes too much.’</em></p>
<p>It was a straight dress but when she wore it, it showed off her figure, and boasted a deep cleavage.  It was the simplest dress she could find among all of them.</p>
<p>Emma was stunned after spreading the other dresses, as she had never heard of such resplendent and unconventional designs for aristocrats. At least, casual clothes and outdoor dresses were relatively simple, but if she wore such casual clothes to the dining hall, she would become the laughing stock and suspected to be lacking common sense and culture.</p>
<p>Despite the plunging neckline, she really liked it. The silk slid down from her hips to her thighs in a smooth curve, and below the knees, it was layered with silver, and whenever it caught light, there was a subtle reflection. She also succeeded in covering her almost-exposed chest with her long hair.</p>
<p><em>‘I wouldn’t have been able to wear this with a questionable hairdo.’</em></p>
<p>When she drew closer to the dining hall, the hallway became filled with the sound of people’s voices. After taking another deep breath she stood calmly in front of the door. Then the gatekeeper guarding the dinner hall cleared his throat and shouted,</p>
<p>“Miss Emerlin Herman has entered!”</p>
<p>Emma’s eyes became focused on the dining hall as soon as the firmly closed gold-rimmed door opened on both sides. She looked around the inside with a nervous face. Countess Karina, sitting on the front and center platform of the dining hall, looked at Emma with one hand holding a glass of red wine.</p>
<p>Below it, her close acquaintances and people sat, and in the center, there were three rows of rectangular tables filled with court officials and bureaucrats. The number of attendees in the dining hall seemed to exceed one hundred. Everyone blatantly glanced at Emma and commented something amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Emma tightened her stomach and imposingly lifted her chin so that she wouldn’t look meek among the strangers.</p>
<p>“This is Master Herman’s special guest. Please, this way, Miss Herman!” The Countess gracefully opened her mouth, affectionately calling Emma.</p>
<p>Emma took modest steps across the center path of the dining hall and went to her table.</p>
<p>“I saved a seat for you. Please, sit over here.”</p>
<p>When she reached the chair Karina pointed at, a servant, who’d been waiting, pulled her chair out for her. Emma finally took her seat.</p>
