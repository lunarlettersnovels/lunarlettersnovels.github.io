            <h3>Chapter 25.2</h3>
<p>“Thank you for welcoming me.”</p>
<p>Emma felt relaxed with the countess’ welcoming personality. Although she was not familiar with each of the complex upper-level etiquettes, she was at least recognized by the lady of the house, so she knew that it was the same as a guest who was officially invited to Van Wert Castle.</p>
<p><em>‘But…’ </em>Emma suddenly felt something was odd.</p>
<p>Did Irvan often bring women around? It was odd that Countess Karina didn’t even bat an eye after seeing him enter the castle with an unknown woman. When Emma glanced at Irvan with an inquiring look, her sweet voice gently interrupted her.</p>
<p>“Well, Miss Herman…” When Emma carefully shifted her eyes to the countess, the gorgeous woman smiled. “Later on, everyone will gather for tea time in the greenhouse. Just a tiny afternoon event. If you’re fine with it, should I leave a seat open?”</p>
<p>It was such an unexpected invitation. Emma only drew a blank from her mind. She blinked at her feeling tense.</p>
<p>“I will introduce you then. New guests are always welcomed passionately!” Countess Karina exclaimed. “You can attend with no worries.”</p>
<p><em>‘What should I do?’</em> Emma pondered. She was dressed far from casual, but it was awkward to appear like this in front of the countess. A sense of loss pervaded her as she wondered whether to accept the invitation or not.</p>
<p>The Van Wert castle was like a small royal court. It was where the lord of Reshire resided. Emma had heard that people were picky about the level of etiquette one had to maintain in the royal court, but she was just a wealthy middle-class commoner, so she was not properly educated in such detailed manners. Even her strict tutor hadn’t felt the need to teach her court etiquette since Emma had been reluctant to mingle with nobles.</p>
<p><em>‘I’m definitely going to make a mistake.’ </em>Or other people could scrutinize her every action and make it difficult for her. Perhaps it was true that the royal court was a terrifying place. Emma’s face dropped at the thought that she might be caught or ridiculed from her trivial words and actions.</p>
<p><em>‘And I am Irvan’s guest…’</em></p>
<p>So if it was an invitation that could be harmful to him, she would have no choice but to refuse and prepare to be met with displeasure. But as long as she is Irvan’s guest, she would not be bothered. Furthermore, Van Wert Castle would have to be her safehaven in the meantime… If Emma became caught up in controversies, it would only become another battleground inside.</p>
<p><em>‘What’s the most natural excuse?’ </em>While Emma was hesitating, her yes darting to and fro as she thought how she could respond courteously, Irvan grabbed her wrist and pulled her to him.</p>
<p>“No,” he declined for her, to Emma’s relief. “This isn’t a good time. Miss Herman is still reeling in shock after having run into some monsters on our way here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my!” Karina had a shocked expression on her face. “Is that true? D*mn them! And you weren’t injured?” The countess was surpingsingly concerned about Emma’s wellbeing.</p>
<p>Emma modestly bowed her head and said, “I am unharmed, Countess Van Wert.”</p>
<p>“Then, you’re lucky to have arrived safely.”</p>
<p>The longer Emma looked at the other woman, the greater the woman’s beauty became. She couldn’t believe she was a mother and had a son who already a man.  Even though they had the same elegant appearance, her beauty was far more warm than Ivan’s haughty, cold elegance. Karina smiled, as if she was familiar with this admirable gaze on her.</p>
<p>“Come in and take a rest. You must have been so shocked at the sight of blood,” she finally said.</p>
<p>“Then please excuse me.” Emma’s head bobbed up and down.</p>
<p>Looking at her in that state, Countess Karina’s eyebrows narrowed slightly. “Oh, Miss Herman. We must meet after you rest. I would be very grateful if you can regain your strength at tea time.”</p>
<p>Irvan nodded toward Karina, who spoke amicably with a gentle face, and tried to pass by her. However, at the same moment, Countess Karina turned slightly as if she were blocking his path, and smiled after making eye contact with Irvan.</p>
<p>Still all smiles, she said, “The first-floor guestroom is ready. How about it? I think Miss Herman will be comfortable there.”</p>
<p>“There is no need for that. She will be staying with me,” Irvan responded bluntly, and giving no time for Countess Karina to reply, he darted up the stairs, pulling Emma with him.</p>
<p>The countess’ meaningful sigh lingered for a long time in Emma’s ears, but she had no time to pay close attention to it because of Irvan. She could only stare back and bow again. This modicum of courtesy was the best Emma could do.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After they climbed the stairs and passed through the large, wooden doors that blocked the central hallway to the second floor, Emma was met with a cozy interior. An endless hallway seemed to stretch out before her, lined countless doors on both sides.</p>
<p>She looked around excitedly, her wrist still in his grip as he gently dragged her with him. He walked past several doors decorated in gold, turned the corner, and headed towards a splendid door.</p>
<p>“Here we are,” he said, opening the room for Emma to see. “How is it?”</p>
<p>The interior inside was luxurious, as one would expect from nobility. Silk embroidered with gold and silver threads covered the walls and pillars, and all kinds of beautiful decorations and expensive paintings showed off their sublime presence throughout the room.</p>
<p>“It’s exquisite,” she answered truthfully. From where she stood, the floor was densely covered with thick carpets in geometric patterns. Everything was like a painting.</p>
<p>Irvan gauged her reaction. “This is my room. Do you like it?” he asked.</p>
<p>“S-sure.”</p>
<p>Even if the interioir was designed with a masculine taste, it was the most luxurious room Emma had ever seen. It felt like she was standing in the middle of a royal palace.</p>
<p>“Then I guess you’ll definitely be satisfied spending time here…” Irvan mumbled, more to himself than Emma.</p>
