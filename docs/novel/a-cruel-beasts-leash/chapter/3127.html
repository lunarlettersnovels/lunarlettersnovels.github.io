            <h3>Chapter 25.1</h3>
<p>The other party was regrettably, Irvan. But as long as Emma knew Irvan’s true identity, she was not foolish enough to dream in vain.</p>
<p><em>‘If he is Count Van Wert…’</em></p>
<p>It was too far of a dream, like the clouds floating up in the sky. Unreachable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he wasn’t even a nobleman but a margrave. The authority of the margrave responsible for the border of the Perrigans was especially powerful, even within the kingdom. So, even if she were to coincidentally get her hands on him, she wouldn’t be able to hold onto him. And if she were greedy, he wouldn’t stay long.</p>
<p><em>‘That can never come true.’  </em>Emma silently lamented. Turning to Miller, she asked, “Earlier I heard you refer to Irvan as ‘Master’. What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t know, Madam?” Miller enthusiastically replied. “Master Irvan is the head of the Black Knights Order, a key power in the city and the pride of the Van Wert House.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>The suspicion was solved at once. Then that was the reason why Irvan had asked Miller back at the cabin if he was accompanied by knights. Emma’s curiosity about Irvan’s identity was finally resolved.</p>
<p>If he was the next margrave, the head of the Knights Order, and the legitimate heir of Van Wert, and not just a run-of-the-mill cabin keeper, there would be more than a couple of maidens who loved or sought after him. But Emma had spent one, no, two nights with him.</p>
<p>‘<em>Thankfully, though, that was also his first time…’ </em>Frankly, that was hard to believe. <em>‘But he’s not the one to lie.’</em></p>
<p>Supressing a sigh inside, she shook of the myriad of thoughts clouding her head. Emma wanted nothing more than to open the window and brazenly ask Irvan if he was engaged, but it would be highly inappropriate to ask him about such a thing after she learned of his identity through Miller.</p>
<p>Emma tried hard to remain composed, suppressing her urge to snoop around his personal life. Instead, she fixed her eyes outside the window to eliminate the excessive thoughts and distract her attention, when the carriage suddenly stopped in front of a fancy, high-class store.</p>
<p>“This is a clothing store, Madam.” Miller said. “You may enter.”</p>
<p>Emma was taken aback, but she exited the carriage with him. As soon as they were outside, Irvan dismounted from the horse and approached her.</p>
<p>“After you. My lovely lady,” he said endearingly, making Emma blush like a maiden.</p>
<p>Escorted by the prince-like Irvan, who had held out his arm, Emma entered the clothing store, feeling like a girl from a fairytale storybook.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Inside the store, Emma tried many clothing with Irvan. Only after awhile did they emerge back outside, and Emma mounted on the carriage once again, now properly, and almost beautifully, dressed. There destination was the old, magnificent castle.</p>
<p>Before long the carriage passed the solid gates of the Van Wert Castle and there were gathere at the main entrance.</p>
<p>“We have arrived,” Miller politely announced this as he opened the door.</p>
<p>Irvan, already waiting for Emma to dismount, held out his hand. “You look much better now that you’re properly dressed. Very pretty.” He spared her no lack of compliments.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the compliment…” her eyes flitted to the ground. “Thank you so much.”</p>
<p>There was noticeable change to her demeanor. After all, the man she slept with and originally thought was a mere cabin-keeper was a high-ranking noble. Everytime she was reminded of Irvan’s true identity, and their differences that encompassed miles, the way she spoke to him became cordial.</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Irvan was looking down at Emma, slightly displeased. He grabbed her wrist and turned her face to him. “Your words are stiff.”</p>
<p>“That’s because people are watching… Lord Irvan,” she replied unfalteringly.</p>
<p>His eyes held her face for a brief moment, mulling over her words. “Ohh. I see… <em>Miss</em> Herman.”</p>
<p>Their entourage upon their arrival was a throng of servants forming two lines, and bowing respectfully to greet Irvan.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Master Irvan”</p>
<p>“Good evening, Master.”</p>
<p>They chorused together. Irvan merely brisked past them through the front door, nodding nonchalantly. Emma tried to keep her walking pace alike with his, but it was a challenging feat due to her new shoes and dress. All of her energy was focused on walking upright since she thought she might look ridiculous or trip unexpectedly.</p>
<p>“Irvan!”</p>
<p>A lady with resplendent elegance, called out to him sweetly. She walked down the stairs of the beautifully arched staircase connecting the lobby and the main entrance. She was a young lady, with a slim body, blonde locks gracefully rolling in waves over her shoulders. Emma wondered if she was his aunt or older sister.</p>
<p>“You’ve only just arrived?”</p>
<p>“…yes.” Irvan replied, abruptly halting in his steps as if he had run into a wall.</p>
<p>The lady, unconcerned with that, smiled brightly like a flower and looked at Emma next. “Oh, my! And you brought a guest!” she exclaimed. “Irvan! It’s my first time seeing the woman next to you. Aren’t you going to introduce her?”</p>
<p>Despite her amicable greeting, Emma could see a frown on Irvan’s face. Then, he reluctantly introduced her. “This is Emerlin Herman. From Summerville. Emma, this here is Lady Karina, also known as Countess Van Wert.”</p>
<p>“It is a pleasure,” she said, the corners of her lips curled into a polished smile. No wonder she boasted extraordinary beauty and dignity: she was a countess… Not Irvan’s sibling or blood relative.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to meet you, Countess Van Wert.”</p>
<p>Emma hurriedly got down on one knee to politely show her courtesy. The countess’ laugh, like a twinkle, drifted from above her. “Welcome to Van Wert Castle, Miss Herman.”</p>
