<p><strong>Chapter 78.2</strong></p>
<p>Emma’s head was so hot that she could hardly think. She accepted the tight feeling of fullness that went up to the top of her head, reaching out an urgent hand to caress his solid muscles and hugging his neck tightly.</p>
<p>“Yes, hold on to my leash,” he growled.</p>
<p>Their bodies moved together in perfect harmony, each thrust driving her closer to the edge of ecstasy.</p>
<p>“Until you die, no, even if you die, don’t let me go,” he whispered, his voice rough with desire.</p>
<p>Emma was overwhelmed with pleasure, her entire body consumed by the sensations coursing through her. She was lost in the moment, unable to think of anything else but the heat and intensity of their passion.</p>
<p>As morning light streamed through the window of the bridal room, the two lovers continued to writhe together in a frenzy of desire, lost in the intoxicating pleasure of their union.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Most of the wedding guests were preoccupied with the splendid events of the day, and were unaware that the Count and Mrs. Van Wert had been completely invisible. On the last day of the wedding, Emma and Irvan appeared at the official place with full energy and entertained the guests.</p>
<p>The guests, who had not seen the Count and Mrs. Van Wert all day, hurriedly covered their mouths and whispered to each other. Emma blushed as she fanned herself, feeling the sullen glances from her friends.</p>
<p>After the three-day wedding was over, the guests began to leave one by one. Philip Herman was the last to pack his clothes.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Lady Emmerlyn.”</p>
<p>“Uncle, you don’t have to be so formal when we’re together. Please speak comfortably.”</p>
<p>“No. You’re a high-ranking countess, so how can I speak comfortably? I prefer it like this. Lady Emma.”</p>
<p>During his stay at the Van Wert castle, Philip was treated with exceptional hospitality and wore a satisfied look on his face. The aristocrats he met there were big-time moguls who he wouldn’t normally dare to speak to, so he was just satisfied with having connections.</p>
<p>Reshire was an unfamiliar place to Philip since he came from Polarville, but there was nothing to lose by knowing high-ranking nobles. Besides, the countess that would reign there like a queen was none other than his niece, Emma. As the days passed, his nose grew taller, and his shoulders were puffed up.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s about my brother’s inheritance. As dowry…”</p>
<p>Philip was about to bring up the money he had already prepared, but he felt a cool stare from Emma and quickly blurted it out. Even though Count Van Wert looked calm, his coolness felt unusual. Philip cleared his throat and looked at Count Van Wert.</p>
<p>Perhaps because his rank was higher than other nobles, he was more dignified than them. Since he was both a Marshal and the commander of the knights, it was perhaps natural for him to exude a cold and callous feeling. He was usually taciturn and didn’t talk much, but his terrifying presence alone was more than enough to subdue the other nobles.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep it brief. The marriage has already been settled, so there’s no need to rush.”</p>
<p>In response, Philip swallowed down the story of the dowry he had prepared with great effort and whatever else he was about to say. After all, Emma was like a goose that laid golden eggs. It wasn’t necessary to cut the goose open. It was enough to just accept whatever was given.</p>
<p>Frankly, he had no idea that Emma would succeed, not only in marriage, but in securing a title, snagging a big shot like that. Looking back, he was satisfied because all of these results seemed to be because of her own self. If his niece hadn’t made her way to Polarville, she would never have received this miraculous honour.</p>
<p>“I wish you two the best of luck. I think the children will be happy when they hear the good news.”</p>
<p>Before Philip climbed into the carriage, he bent towards Van Wert. “Visit often. You’re welcome any time.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, you say such nice words. I’ll leave now.”</p>
<p>“Alright, see you next time.”</p>
<p>Emma had a wide smile plastered on her face as she waved gracefully.</p>
<p>“If I am healthy and well, I will go visit you again.”</p>
<p>After wishing him goodbye, Philip confirmed that his luggage was loaded on the roof for the last time and sat down. Just as the carriage was about to depart, Count Van Wert, who had been silent the whole time as he exuded an icy atmosphere, stopped the carriage with a simple gesture.</p>
<p>“Mr Herman.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I forgot to take care of your travel expenses. Take this.”</p>
<p>Count Van Wert glanced coolly at him, and a skinny man who looked like his subordinate approached the carriage. His subordinate, who had a monocle, handed him a leather pouch.</p>
<p>Philip judged the amount by feeling the heavy weight on his fingers. He held back the corners of his lips that were subconsciously about to curl upwards and bowed his head to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>“Oh, you. This… thank you. Count.”</p>
<p>Count Van Wert looked at Philip with an expressionless look and went back next to Emma.</p>
<p>“Uncle, see you!”</p>
<p>Emma waved her hand, and the carriage began to move slowly. Philip took one last glimpse at the majestic Van Wert Castle that was getting further away. After checking his surroundings, he carefully opened the leather pouch.</p>
