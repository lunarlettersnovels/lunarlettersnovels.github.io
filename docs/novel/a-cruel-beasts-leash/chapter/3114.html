            <p><strong>Chapter 31.2</strong></p>
<p>“There must be an interesting story about how you came to this unfamiliar place as a guest, but since you say so, Miss Herman, I should look forward to it later. By the way, when did you arrive? I stayed in the castle until recently then left for a while and came back, but I didn’t hear any news about any visitors,” Collin continued speaking.</p>
<p>“It was only a few days ago.”</p>
<p>“I get it. Did you attend dinner by the way?”</p>
<p>“I did not.”</p>
<p>“That is interesting. Did Count Limon invite you?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure about that. Since I’m still recovering from the fatigue of my travels.”</p>
<p>“Are you feeling better now?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Since she had already come outside, she couldn’t make excuses about her physical condition.</p>
<p>“If so, I can see you at dinner this evening, Miss Herman. When we meet then, I think it’ll be more welcoming than now.”</p>
<p>Colling, who lively spoke with a pretentious smile, later returned to the carriage, saying that he had something to share with the bishop.</p>
<p>At Collin’s disappearance, Baron Berne narrowed his eyes, his face showing his disapproval, but it was gone the next moment, as if it had never happened.</p>
<p>“Let’s go this way,” he finally said.</p>
<p>The two resumed their walk. As they turned the corner of a remote building and reached a wall, Baron Berne scoured the surroundings, confirming that there were no people around.</p>
<p>“We must be cautious,” he warned her in a low voice.</p>
<p>Emma wordlessly glanced at him, then shifted her eyes ahead. Perhaps because it was a vague path, there was no one else walking around. Emma waited obediently. Only after checking the surroundings, the baron said, “Sir Collin is an able but mysterious man. Lady Karina is kind of the same way as well. That must run in the Muns family.”</p>
<p>Passing the wall and through the low flower bed in the garden, Baron Berne added, “I’m concerned about the sudden deterioration of Count Limon’s health in recent years, and it bothers me that even after adulthood, Master Irvan has not gotten engaged.”</p>
<p>Emma was keen on listening when Irvan’s name was mentioned.</p>
<p><em>‘Engagement…?’</em>  She had been trying her best to ignore that nagging question in her mind, but at some point she had become curious about Irvan’s private life.</p>
<p>“Irvan isn’t engaged?” she asked.</p>
<p>Baron Berne shook his head. “No, he isn’t, madam. Somehow, that’s what happened.”</p>
<p><em>‘That is unexpected,’ </em>she thought curiously. After all, a high-profile nobleman with a prosperous future like Irvan normally decided on marriage before adulthood.</p>
<p>“The count came down with his illness at the time when the marriage was being discussed. From then on, several letters of proposal were sent to the castle, but we didn’t show any significant response. Of course, ‘we’ refers to Countess Karina acting as a substitute for Count Limon,” he narrated.</p>
<p>Baron Berne whacked his cane hard on the floor. “It may be an old man’s unnecessary worrying, but since you came as a guest of Master Irvan, I think it would be better to be as careful as possible.”</p>
<p>Emma was just thinking that same thing. She nodded with a serious look in her eyes. “I shall keep that in mind,” she said.</p>
<p>“Right,” Baron Berne nodded. “You seem to be a sweet and thoughtful person, so I’m relieved.”</p>
<p>While they were conversing and strolling around the garnen, a servant came to announce to Baron Berne that the advisory council was scheduled.</p>
<p>Baron Berned stroked his white beard after instructing something to the servant, then he turned to Emma. “Unfortunately, this old man must leave now. I’ll have my reliable secretary assist you. His legs are stronger than mine, and he’s even got vitality, so it will be easy for him to guide you.”</p>
<p>A while later a slender man with an eyeglass lens over one eye appeared in front of Emma. He was slightly shorter than Irvan, and scrawny.</p>
<p>“I am Laute,” he briefly introduced himself.</p>
<p>Laute was a clerk and Baron Berne’s secretary. He seemed well adapted to his job; working on documents all the time, his skin was pale, as he didn’t get much sunlight. Moreover, he was stubborn and formal despite his outer appearance making him look extremely fussy and nervous.</p>
<p>He his teeth with his forehead narrowed; Laute looked silent and cautious. From this, Emma thought that his personality was not much different from his appearance.</p>
<p>“Take good care of Miss Herman,” Baron Berne said.</p>
<p>Laute nodded respectfully, “I will take over from here, sir.”</p>
<p>As soon as Baron Berne, smiling and tapping his cane, disappeared into the castle, Laute showed Emma his true colors.</p>
<p>“Are you really, <em>really, </em>the master’s guest, madam?” he asked exaggeratedly in suspicion.</p>
<p>Emma’s shoulders shrunk, as if she were a criminal being interrogated, she nodded slowly and averted her eyes. “…yes,” she replied.</p>
<p>“A <em>female</em> guest?” Laute said incredulously, more to himself that her.</p>
<p>Emma blinked. Did he mean to say that she didn’t look like a female despite having put on a dress? Or was it another way of saying he didn’t like her?</p>
<p>Emma’s twitched, and with a frown she snapped back at him. “Then do I look like a man?”</p>
<p>Laute laughed. “A feisty one. I like that side of you much better, Miss Herman. Submissive ladies are boring.”</p>
<p>Laute was totally different from his appearance, that much was proven now.  Unlike his outer image, he was a chatterbox.</p>
<p>“Life sure does have its surprises. Who was the first to express their feelings, madam? If it isn’t too much to ask, I really want to know. I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep if I don’t hear it today,” he chatted on, unafraid.</p>
<p>After his initial shock of Emma being Irvan’s guest, he was soon busy babbling about one thing after another with disbelief all over his face.</p>
<p>“So he was a man after all..” he looked to Emma then added, “He hasn’t shown interest in the opposite sex, so I secretly wondered if he was gay. But that doesn’t mean he paid attention to other guys. Oh no, madam. By the way, are you two in a relationship? Otherwise, there’s no reason to invite you as a guest. Oh, did he make the first move? Really, did he?”</p>
<p>Being glared and bombarded with so much questions, Emma stayed quiet for a while before giving him a simple reply.</p>
<p>“I think I was probably the one who made the first move.”</p>
