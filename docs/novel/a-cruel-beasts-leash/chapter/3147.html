            <p><strong>Chapter 14.2</strong></p>
<p>“Okay,” he said slowly. “So, you have nothing to do with the people I mentioned?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I don’t know any Miller or Colliner or anyone.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Do you swear it by your honour? On your luck and misfortune and everything?”</p>
<p>“I swear by it. I really don’t know any of them,” said Emma enthusiastically to leave no doubt.</p>
<p>“Okay. So, it’s not a trap,” mumbled the man to himself and leaned down.</p>
<p>“Then did you just get lucky?” he whispered in her ears.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>“It’s Emma. My name is Emma,” she said to him firmly, gathering her senses.</p>
<p>No matter how she might have taken off her clothes and embraced him, she didn’t want to be called ‘you’. She had a name. Even if she was indebted to him and was grateful, it felt insulting to be called ‘you’ after she had introduced herself already. Moreover, they weren’t friends or anything to address each other with so much familiarity. Emma recalled that she had revealed her name to him but knew nothing of him. Not even his name.</p>
<p>It was rude of him to not even introduce himself.  <em>We spent a night together as man and woman. How could I have not asked his name? He saved my life, but this isn’t right…</em></p>
<p>Emma stared at him determinedly. “By the way, who are you?” she asked.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I already told you my name. Who are you?”</p>
<p>“My name?” With his lips still on her ear, he laughed softly. Emma gulped as his light breath tickled her neck. Her heart pounded and was out of control.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s rude not to introduce yourself. What is your name?”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with it even if I tell you?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think it is strange that we spent the night with each other, but you won’t even tell me your name?”</p>
<p>“Why is it so strange?” The man teased.</p>
<p>“What?” Emma was left speechless. Suddenly the close distance with the man made her feel uncomfortable. She squirmed and tried to twist out of his arms. “I am not that kind of a woman! I don’t spend a night with someone I don’t even know the name of.”</p>
<p>The more she struggled, the more he held her tight and whispered in her ears. “Even though you say that it was different last night.” His low voice heated Emma’s cheek. She blushed. “You suddenly took off your clothes and rushed into my arms. You didn’t seem to be bothered about my name yesterday,” he whispered in a low, deep voice.</p>
<p><em>Did I really do that? I guess it could be true. I did take off my clothes willingly. </em>Emma’s scarlet eyes trembled in embarrassment. She felt as though her heart was going to beat out of my chest. <em>But… did I really do that?</em></p>
<p>She didn’t think she was capable of something like that after just a glass of alcohol. Emma firmly believed that she couldn’t do something like that. She never did anything impulsively unless she had a good reason for it.</p>
<p><em>Was it because of something that might have been mixed in the alcohol? </em>Everything felt suspicious. Looking down at her confused face, the man with a mischievous smile lifted her chin. “You did so most stubbornly.” His gaze was both chilly and warm in that moment.</p>
<p>Emma felt like she was standing in front of a violent beast. She felt helpless. Curiously, she didn’t seem threatened or frightened. She somewhat liked it. A strange relief filled her mind instead of fear. <em>Perhaps I am used to him because we spent the night together. Maybe my body recognizes his touch.</em> She looked up at his lips. <em>What would it feel like to touch those lips? </em>She wondered.</p>
<p>“Thanks to you, I couldn’t sleep all night.” The man smirked, gently leaning down. “I kept thinking whether I was caught in a trap. But I’m surprised that it was none of that.” His face came close to hers and suddenly his lips were on hers. As soon as their lips touched, the heat rose up in Emma.</p>
<p>At that moment, a soft touch broke in with a gap in the closed pink lips.</p>
<p>“Hmm!”</p>
<p>Emma’s whole body was tense with an unfamiliar sensation.</p>
<p>As if to loosen her stiff body, the man murmured with an ecstatic smile with his small lips.</p>
<p>“Hush, Emma.”</p>
