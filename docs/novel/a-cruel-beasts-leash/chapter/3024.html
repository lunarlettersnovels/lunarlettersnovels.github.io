<p>“I’m fine either way. What about you, Emma?” Irvan asked, his gaze fixed on her as he began to remove his jacket, revealing his solid neck and shoulder line.</p>
<p>Emma’s gaze was drawn to his masculine physique and she felt a flush of heat spread through her body. Every time she looked at him, it was as if a fire was slowly igniting inside her.</p>
<p>“You’re a beautiful bride, suitable for a bridal room,” Irvan murmured, as he leaned over her and gently lifted the flower crown from her forehead. Emma’s long hair, tucked into the veil, cascaded over her shoulders in waves.</p>
<p>“Emma,” Irvan said, his voice low and husky.</p>
<p>“Mr Irvan,” Emma replied, looking up at him through her eyelashes.</p>
<p>Their eyes met and their breath mingled as Irvan leaned in closer and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead.</p>
<p>“You’re calling me by the wrong title,” Irvan said, pulling back slightly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Emma asked, confused.</p>
<p>“You used to call me casually when you were excited, but now you’re being formal in a place like this? We’re a couple now. Call out to me again,” Irvan said, his gaze intense and burning as memories of their past moments together flooded Emma’s mind.</p>
<p>Emma’s heart raced as she looked up at him, feeling the weight of his words and the intimacy of the moment. She knew that from that moment on, things would never be the same between them.</p>
<p>Like a dazzling shooting star that suddenly lights up the dark night sky, those moments were so brilliant and enchanting that Emma thought they would disappear like a dream after she blinked. She had thought that their relationship would end someday and it would be a sad thing, but now she wondered if the earnest desire in her heart had reached him. And with that, she hoped their relationship would grow.</p>
<p>Frankly, Emma still couldn’t quite believe it. But, she never wanted to wake up if this was a dream.</p>
<p>“Irvan,” Emma finally said, her voice small but filled with a mixture of emotions.</p>
<p>With just taking out the ‘Mr’, his name took on a special meaning for her, familiar and friendly. Her heart swelled as she said it.</p>
<p>“Yes, Emma,” Irvan replied, his gaze fixated on hers as he drew closer. Emma’s lips parted and his soft tongue slipped into her mouth.</p>
<p>“That’s right. In the future, you have to call me like this. Take out the ‘Mr’,” Irvan said, smiling contentedly, as he gently lifted her chin and began to kiss her with such passion, it felt like he was devouring her.</p>
<p>Emma was happy to reciprocate and their tongues became entangled as they moved together in a dance of desire. Heat melted into her saliva as they kissed each other deeply, while his skilled tongue explored her mouth.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Irvan’s lips drew away from hers and landed gently on the slender nape of her neck, lightly sucking her delicate skin. Every time he did this, Emma’s body would relax and her mind would go completely blank as if she was under a spell.</p>
<p>His two large palms suddenly cupped her plump mounds and circled her sensitive nubs. Her heart was beating strongly against her chest. Emma sighed in pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ha… it’s soft,” Irvan whispered.</p>
<p>As his large hands stimulated her plump mounds as if they were kneading dough, her body gradually weakened. She felt a heat pool between her legs. He squeezed and teased her mounds again and again.</p>
<p>She could feel her body quickly become engulfed in a familiar s*nsual sensation.</p>
<p>Her chest was tight and warm, and her nether region throbbed and contracted. Her soaked inner walls wanted nothing more than his hot and hard length to fill the tight space inside her. She let out m0an after m0an, filled with l*st.</p>
<p>She wanted to be one with him right there and then.</p>
<p>Emma trembled with longing and gently pressed her knees together before Irvan grabbed her waist with large hands. It was as if he had read her mind, and with capable, dextrous movements, he pulled up the hem of her poofy wedding dress.</p>
<p>Emma gasped as Irvan slowly spread her thighs apart and drew nearer to her core. His dark eyes ran over her slender, feminine body and towards her face.</p>
<p>“Emma…”</p>
<p>Irvan pulled back, breathing deeply. He deftly took off his pants and revealed his desire for her underneath. His erect p3nis looked as if it was about to burst. Emma turned hot at sight of his manh00d and with a small smile, Irvan slowly rubbed the tip of his pillar across her wet petals.</p>
<p>They were both hot and wet for each other. His p3nis throbbed and pulsed as if it were in need of desperate stimulation. Emma’s core was tight and she could feel nectar slightly spread from her warm insides.</p>
<p>“You’re excited…”</p>
<p>S3m3n formed like dew on his tip. It slowly rolled down across his length, and her thighs trembled.</p>
<p>“Just as much as me, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>As his hot skin touched hers, it stimulated her skin er0tically, and a thrill rushed through Emma’s body.</p></div>
