            <p><strong>Chapter 52.1</strong></p>
<p>Baroness Berne smiled softly and lifted the cup with her wrinkled hand. “The other day when Evelyn stayed at the castle, there was a child who was very impressed with Miss Herman.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Emma became interested. If so, it must have been one of the maids who followed Evelyn at that time. “I wonder who it is.”</p>
<p>“To give a brief introduction…” Emma was curious, and the baroness gave her a brief description of the maid she would meet in the future. She was the eldest daughter of the cook, who had been loyal to the Berne family from generation to generation. At the age of five, she followed her mother to join the Berne estate and was selected as a maid because she was skillful with chores. Baroness Berne emphasized that she was sincere and truthful.</p>
<p>“She also has a great memory and is very smart, so she won’t cause a problem,” Baroness Berne added.</p>
<p>Emma felt overwhelmed. “That’s too much of a talent for me…” she timidly said.</p>
<p>“After spending time with her, I’m sure you will like her. She’s a very nice kid.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” As Emma smiled gratefully.</p>
<p>The Baroness and Evelyn made eye contact quietly and signaled to the butler. Soon, a woman in a maid’s uniform entered the greenhouse.</p>
<p>“Her name is Jenna. Say hello, Jenna.”</p>
<p>The familiar-looking woman bowed slightly as soon as she saw Emma. “It’s nice to meet you again,” she greeted.</p>
<p>“Oh, I have seen you before!” Emma exclaimed.</p>
<p>Jenna had left a strong impression on Emma. The last time when she made medicine for menstrual cramps for Evelyn in the annex, she remembered the thorough maid who dropped the drug into silver to check if it was safe. Intelligent and meticulous people were very valuable, so there was no harm in keeping them close.</p>
<p>“Miss Herman, I look forward to working with you.” Jenna put her hands together in front of her and politely bowed to show courtesy.</p>
<p>“I also look forward to it.”</p>
<p>“Jenna. Take good care of Miss Herman,” the Baroness said.</p>
<p>Jenna bowed her head in response to the baroness’s kind words and modestly said, “Yes. It was a difficult request, but thank you for allowing me to do so.” She stood up straight then bowed politely to the Baroness and Evelyn again.</p>
<p>The Baroness softly spoke, “No, we are grateful that you came forward. You have opened the way for us to repay Miss Herman this favor.”</p>
<p>Emma listened intently to the story; it seemed that Jenna had the idea of being Emma’s assistant first. Evelyn, who realized the maid’s intentions, then formally came up with the idea and it seems that the baroness granted it.</p>
<p>“I’ve never had any siblings, but I’m glad Jenna is here,” Emma said.</p>
<p>“I grew up as the eldest daughter, and I’ve been praised for being diligent and responsible. I’ll serve Miss Herman with all my heart,” Jenna replied.</p>
<p>“Then, I will be in your care.” After that, a friendly atmosphere continued in the greenhouse. After chatting for a while and sipping tea until late afternoon, Emma and Jenna went down to the basement dispensary and spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“I am not a noble. But to be the maid of a commoner like me? I wonder how you made such a huge decision,” Emma bluntly said.</p>
<p>“Please speak comfortably, miss. From now on, I will take care of you for a long time.”</p>
<p>“Still…” Even though they were both commoners, it was awkward because she was not used to having a maid. She talked comfortably as a habit with the nanny who had been by Emma’s side for a long time, but it wasn’t like she was a subordinate.</p>
<p>“You can speak however you want. I’m a maid so I’m used to serving my superiors. And you don’t have to worry too much about me because I volunteered to learn from you,” Jenna said.</p>
<p>“If it’s learning, you mean medicine?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you don’t know much about me, but I’m from a large family. I have a lot of younger siblings. Seven of them. But I was worried because everyone was always sick and they weren’t feeling well.” Jenna, spoke with a serious gaze, then continued in an earnest tone.</p>
<p>“Lady Evelyn took the medicine that Miss Herman gave her and her condition improved. Madame was also saved after drinking the medicine that the young lady had made. So I thought that if I could handle medicines like you, I would be able to protect the health of my family. Everyone catches a cold every season and always suffers from minor illnesses.”</p>
<p>Emma, who grew up alone, couldn’t imagine how the atmosphere of the large family would be like, but her expression naturally softened when she pictured a harmonious family. It was not for any other selfish or personal reasons. Jenna, as the eldest daughter, thought of the rest of her family and was concerned for her seven younger siblings. How can she be so sweet and kind? Honestly, girls around Emma’s age were busy dressing up and decorating themselves, but putting her family before herself… Emma, whose heart warmed upon hearing Jenna’s words, put on a soft smile.</p>
<p>“If that’s the reason, then it’s a good choice. I also needed help, so let’s help each other,” Emma warmly said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Jenna bowed brightly, “ Thank you for accepting me.”</p>
<p>“No, thank you very much. Let’s take care of each other and get along.”</p>
<p>“Yes, miss, I’ll serve you well.” Emma smiled and taught Jenna simple things to break the awkward atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Would you like to clean these up? I will teach you the tricks.”</p>
<p>It was to clean and disinfect the used medicine bottles and tools scattered on the desk with alcohol. As if she was very adept at these kinds of chores, Jenna handled it very well. As the baroness said, she was good with her hands, and the work was done quickly and accurately.</p>
