            <p><strong>Chapter 56.2</strong></p>
<p>“I bought it with <em>my</em> money,” Emma said. “I bought it for a considerable amount  because he was going to scrap it!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Miss Herman, but what I’ve heard is different. It seems like you stole them with the knights at the forefront. Tsk, isn’t it a group theft?”</p>
<p>“Then bring in the Knights of the Berne! Listen to their statement!”</p>
<p>“No,” Collin shook his head, a look of pity on his face. “It’s not the fault of your <em>poor</em> accomplices, but the main culprit who ordered it. So Miss Herman, you will be punished, <em>alone</em>. Now that you’re cornered, you’re suddenly trying to blame everyone for your demise. As expected, you have a bad conscience.”</p>
<p>Collin let out a nasty laugh and clicked his tongue. Through a series of conversations, Emma sensed that no matter what she said, it would never work.</p>
<p><em>‘He must have received a report from the keeper or put a tail on the carriage.’ </em>Emma immediately realized that Collin had been looking for her, and that she had been caught in a trap. It had been planned beforehand.</p>
<p>“See.” As Emma shut her mouth and remained silent, Collin pointed at Emma and shook his head.</p>
<p>“I’m tired of hearing the same story all my life, and Miss Herman here is the same. Criminals all say that they are innocent! If you feel unfair or resentful, try to solve it gradually during the execution process. You see, Miss Herman, the truth doesn’t go anywhere,” Collin shook his head and said with a pious look on his face.</p>
<p>“Now then, that’s not the point of this visit,” he continued/ “Confession is important, so let’s do an <em>in-depth</em> examination from now on…”</p>
<p>“Examination?” Emma’s heart thundered. “Then Call for Baron Bern!”</p>
<p>Collin merely grinned as Emma glared daggers at him. “It’s not even a formal court. Is it necessary?” He turned to the people behind him and said, “This time I will personally interrogate the criminal, so leave us alone.” The people who came with Collin swarmed out of the prison door at his instruction.</p>
<p>“Oh, leave the shutters open as well! I’ll have to make sure it’s a fair interrogation. Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p>Collin, who gave instructions to the knights with a wink, smirked satisfactorily after confirming that the shutters above the door had been opened.</p>
<p>“Miss Herman,” he began. He turned his head and faced Emma. He licked his lips. “The more I look at you, the more exciting you look.” His languid eyes were filled with obscene l*st.</p>
<p>“I heard that your talents below..  are quite something. Rumors have it that it’s deep and sticky, so it tightens indescribably. No wonder the Knight Commander, who is usually like a stone, was mesmerized.”</p>
<p>Emma spat as hard as she could. As the saliva clung to Collin’s cheek, he raised his finger and swept it across his cheek.</p>
<p>“You have a temper. It’s going to be pretty fun. I wish you’d be jumping like this underneath me.”  He brought his saliva-soaked hand to his lips, sniffed, and licked it. “This sticky saliva is like the love liquid that flows down from your bottom. It’s very delicious, maybe because it’s what the Knight Commander ate.”</p>
<p>“You are disgusting! Filthy!” As Emma yelled hatefully, Collin grinned and laughed.</p>
<p>“There is nothing to be shy about between us. It’s just a fragrance. Your garden must be sticky and moist like this, right?”</p>
<p>His insidious words that revealed his true intentions gave Emma goosebumps. Emma clenched her teeth, stepped back and twisted her body away from him. Collin licked his lips. “Shall we explore that hole and taste the fresh love juice?” Collin smiled and began to loosen his trousers. Emma realized what he was about to do, and hurriedly ran to the corner.</p>
<p>“Yes, keep running like that. It’s fun.” Collin, who had loosened his pants, put one foot forward. Emma flinched, her face deathly pale, and continued to stagger backwards until her back touched the hard, cold wall. Emma’s grew cold when she realized that there was no place to retreat in the narrow prison</p>
<p>“Well, well… are you looking forward to it?” Collin whispered. Emma’s frozen eyes shook slightly. “I will finally know how you seduced Irvan now that I can experience it myself. You had a great time spreading your legs for him, right? That’s good. Cause I really need you for what I’m going to do.”</p>
<p>As Collin, grinning and smirking, hurried closer, Emma tensed and pressed herself against the wall. His nasty gaze scanning her whole body was as horrible as a disgusting bug crawling around, and chills ran through her tense spine. Emma’s pupils constricted sharply with tension.</p>
<p>“It’s a good thing that Irvan had already explored your insides, so no matter who sows the seeds in your hole, he will have nothing to say, right?” Colin taunted, approaching Emma with his arms wide open.</p>
<p>When he was within reach, Emma finally swung what she had pulled out of her pocket.</p>
