            <p><strong>Chapter 48.2</strong></p>
<p>The knights rejoiced when Emma appeared in the hallway while they were still looking.</p>
<p>“The lady finally came out?”</p>
<p>“I see! The beauty is a procrastinator. It’s okay, madam. Ha-ha!”</p>
<p>Emma tucked a strand of hair that had fallen behind her ears. “Now that I’ve rested enough, I should get back to the dinner hall,” she said.</p>
<p>Looking at Emma’s face, they exchanged meaningful glances and openly tried to lead Emma to the terrace.</p>
<p>“But you’re still unhappy…”</p>
<p>“Have you been inside for too long, Miss Herman? At times like this, you need some outside air.”</p>
<p>“I will take you. Rest your hand on my strong arm.”</p>
<p>Emma only smiled faintly, not gracing them with an answer. She left the lounge and followed a middle-aged lady passing through the hallway.</p>
<p>“Ma’am!” she called.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>When Emma unexpectedly interlocked her arm with the woman’s arm, the woman made a surprised face, but Emma smiled naturally as she kept up the pace.</p>
<p>“Are you heading to the dinner hall?” she asked amicably.</p>
<p>“Oh, my. I sure am,” the woman smiled.</p>
<p>“So am I. You were inside earlier, right? If I have to introduce myself again. I’m Emma.”</p>
<p>Emma skillfully clung to her as the remaining knights followed her with absurd expressions. Before long, their expressions turned into annoyance.</p>
<p>The three knights that sat next to her when they’d returned to the dinner hall still kept trying to pester her. But it all went into one of Emma’s ears and out of the other.</p>
<p>“The wind outside is cold, so I don’t want to go out,” she bluntly declined.</p>
<p>“No way. It’ll be a change of pace once the cool wind hits you-”</p>
<p>“No more. I like it inside.”</p>
<p>Collin, who’d returned inside way too late, glared at Emma with a stormy face. He seemed to have taken a lot of time and effort to look at every nook and cranny for her. Emma was already sitting calmly with a nonchalant look on her face. His stare bored into the left side of her face, but Emma swiftly ignored it. With a faint smile, she picked up her knife and fork and slowly cleared the food from her plate.</p>
<p>Perhaps, because there was no creativity, the dinner in Van Wert Castle was similar every time. From minstrels, chamber music performances to clown performances. Finally, all of the boring, repetitive performances ended.</p>
<p>The persistence of the knights surrounding Emma did not stop until the very end. All throughout, Emma kept a cold silence and hung out with the ladies on the other table without speaking to the knights. Emma was nervous that something might unexpectedly happen, so she immediately headed to the aristocratic table where Baron Berne sat, as soon as the dinner was over.</p>
<p>The three persistent knights scattered like defeated dogs when Baron Berne began escorting Emma. Collin’s gaze followed the back of Emma’s head as they walked towards the front door. Only when her figure disappeared, did he then  finally take his eyes off her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The carriage rattled. Emma lowered her eyes and fell deep inside her thoughts as the luxurious carriage, with the Baron’s family crest, ran down the darkened street.</p>
<p><em>‘Red matgal… Tasugari.’</em></p>
<p>Both were ingredients that had been secretly, skillfully administered to Irvan. After facing the obvious hostility of the Muns siblings at dinner today, Emma could clearly see who was behind everything; they would also be the people who’d played tricks on Irvan in the cabin.</p>
<p>A new face comes barging in and tries to cast out the remaining patrons. It was just like that. The Muns siblings, having assimilated into Van Wert Castle, whose owner was bedridden, were trying to dominate and threaten Irvan.</p>
<p>In such a gloomy situation, it was fortunate that a dignified, loyal vassal like Baron Berne was on Irvan’s side. Emma wanted to confide all this to Baron Berne, but above all, there was no evidence, and it was another question whether the baron would believe her. Simply put, Baron Berne was Irvan’s confidant, not someone on Emma’s side. Moerover, the royal court was a complicated society. Emma could not guarantee what would happen in the future if she trusted Baron Berne and raised negative suspicions about Countess Karina.</p>
<p><em>‘I shouldn’t behave so impatiently.’</em></p>
<p>The wounds of betrayal she suffered from Dora and Otto, whom she had believed were her people, were still painful. Emma decided to persevere, putting the lessons of the past to her bones.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Emma, who had been worried the entire time she was out of Van Wert Castle, was only able to catch her breath after arriving at the Bernes’ home, It was inside a luxurious residential neighborhood of Wert City.</p>
<p>“Emma!”</p>
<p>“Greetings, Baroness Berne and Lady Evelyn.”</p>
<p>Emma gently lifted the hems of her dress to express courtesy to the people of the Berne family mansion. A total of three people lived in the mansion: Baron Robert Berne, Baroness Gabrielle Berne and their granddaughter Evelyn. Lady Evelyn said she was staying in Wert City because of her social activities, and her parents were staying in a castle outside Reshire.</p>
<p>“The liquid medicine you gave me before helped out so much,” Lady Evelyn said.</p>
<p>She led Emma to a guest room, a lively look on her face.  The menstruation had ended, but she said he was no longer afraid of the next month because it had passed much easier than other times.</p>
<p>She turned to Emma, asked, “Is this your first time out of the castle?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Emma replied, nodding.</p>
<p>“Good!”</p>
<p>Evelyn expressed her happiness as she clapped her hands.</p>
