            <p><strong>Chapter 80.2 (end)</strong></p>
<p>He only said that. Narrowing her brows, Emma hesitated before finally opening her mouth.</p>
<p>“Actually, luphenyl acts as a sedative, reducing the stimulants of red matgal. However, I’ve been drinking luphenyl ever since I was young. That’s why I wondered if it was what you smelled at the mountain cabin at that time.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that, though? You’re mistaken.” Irvan immediately shook his head in denial. “I like my wife’s smell so much that it can’t even compare to the smell of this perfume. But, after all, isn’t beauty the most important thing?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Emma blankly looked up at him as words poured out without any warning. He smiled, meeting her silent gaze.</p>
<p>“I mean that you’re pretty. You’re beautiful, and you’re so lovely that it wouldn’t hurt if I kept you inside my eyes.”</p>
<p>“Pfft!” Emma, her cheeks flushed, let out a small laugh. “Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. The more I look at you, the more beautiful you become, and I fall for it over and over again. I said this before, right? I want to keep you in my pocket.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I said ‘no’ because that’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“But it’s serious. My love for my wife is strong.” Irvan raised the corners of his lips and winked. “How was it? Did you like my answer?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>When Emma smiled bashfully and confessed her honest feelings, Irvan shrugged and looked at Emma gently.</p>
<p>“Um, about your uncle.”</p>
<p>“…Yes?”</p>
<p>As Emma raised her head and blinked her eyes at him, Irvan spoke gravely with a troubled look on his face.</p>
<p>“I was wondering if I should say this, but he might be a kleptomaniac.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Emma opened her mouth in surprise.</p>
<p>“The butler said that the gold candlestick in his room is missing.”</p>
<p>Irvan summoned the newly appointed head butler and had him recite the words he had already prepared in advance.</p>
<p>The script was about how no matter how much anyone searched, they couldn’t find the golden candlesticks in Philip’s guest room and the silver dishes that were in there as well.</p>
<p>“Ahh… What should I do?”</p>
<p>Touching her forehead with a delicate hand, Emma instantly became pensive. She was left in a panic and didn’t know what to do. She rolled her eyes before beginning to cry.</p>
<p>“You took care of my uncle’s travel expenses, and he still did such an unpleasant thing. I’ll take responsibility and pay for it.”</p>
<p>Emma sighed as she opened her eyes. She recalled the rumors Layna had mentioned before.</p>
<p><em>‘I heard he had money problems. It was said that it was so big that the house and property had to be sold off. Someone said it was related to gambling, but don’t take it too seriously since it could be a rumor.’</em></p>
<p>Maybe it wasn’t just a rumour… Did Uncle Phillip have a problem with gambling after all?</p>
<p>But to fearlessly steal the count’s golden candlestick and silverware!</p>
<p>Both were items that could be easily obtained at a pawnshop and turned into cash, but with the Van Wert family crest imprinted on the bottom of the items, it would have been more than enough to catch the thief in no time.</p>
<p>Good lord! How addicted to gambling was he, to riskily steal like that?</p>
<p>Irvan hugged her tenderly from behind, as Emma held her hands over her mouth, her shoulders drooping, showing her deep disappointment.</p>
<p>“No. I didn’t mean to ask for reparation or reimbursement or anything like that. I just wanted you to know. Mr. Herman must have had some urgent reason for taking those things. It’s just that I have a hunch that your uncle will never appear here again.”</p>
<p>Emma wholeheartedly agreed with Irvan. There was an old saying that a guilty conscience needs no accuser. It was unlikely that her uncle who had boldly stolen from Count Van Wert would show his face here again.</p>
<p>“Would that make my lovely wife lonely?”</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>Her words said this, but her heart felt different. After Otto and Dora, she couldn’t trust again. The wounds she got from other people were too great.</p>
<p>As Emma’s expression gradually hardened, with a dark shadow between her brows, Irvan led her with a loving hand towards the dressing room.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing big, so don’t think about it too much.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I’m with you. Shouldn’t that be enough?”</p>
<p>That was also true.</p>
<p>Emma’s soft eyes turned to Irvan, and he smiled brightly like an angel of salvation.</p>
<p>“I love you.” His low voice whispered sweetly into her ear.</p>
<p>Emma’s heart melted. The memories of her anxiety, distrust, and disquiet that had engulfed her had been completely melted away for just a moment.</p>
<p>“I love you too.”</p>
<p>“I know that.”</p>
<p>“What do you know?”</p>
<p>“That you fell in love with me at first sight.” Speaking softly, Irvan winked. “Now, I can’t wait to see what my lovely and beautiful wife will wear to the succession next week.”</p>
<p>With her heart feeling warm, Emma shook her head as she looked at her dressing room, which was filled with gorgeous clothes.</p>
<p>“I haven’t thought about it yet.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then let’s think about it together. I just changed my clothes. You should try on some clothes to see what you’d look good in too.”</p>
<p>Irvan cast a glance towards Jenna and beckoned for her to leave.</p>
<p>Confirming that Jenna had gone out of her dressing room, he stood face to face with Emma and took off her clothes layer by layer.</p>
<p>“You’re beautiful.”</p>
<p>Emma, naked, felt shy, and Irvan slowly lowered his head to bury into her mounds. He took a deep breath.</p>
<p>He took several deep breaths as if to calmly savor her sweet smell, then muttered quietly.</p>
<p>“Ever since I smelled your perfume, I wanted to smell your real, sweet flesh, not a fake one.”</p>
<p>Irvan, held her slender waist with his large hands and caressed her body. He lowered his hands and whispered slowly.</p>
<p>“No… I crave your sweet taste more than your smell.”</p>
<p>And they lived happily ever after.</p>
