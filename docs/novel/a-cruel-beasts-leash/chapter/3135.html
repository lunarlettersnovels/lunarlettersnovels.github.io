<p><strong>Chapter 21.1</strong></p>
<p><em>Splash. </em>Emma wiggled inside the warm tub and dipped her body deep into the water as if she were sinking. Her long hair loosened randomly against the water, and floated like a plant. Just as she was about to resurface and open her eyes, Irvan entered the bathtub after her.</p>
<p>“Woo-hoo!”</p>
<p>With a cry, he jumped into the tub, disturbing the still waters sloshing it all around. Emma hurriedly straightened her back. Not missing the opportunity, Irvan wrapped his large hands around her waist, pulling her in. His hands snaked towards her breasts, fully grasping them in his palms.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Strange,” he muttered in a low voice, their bodies pressed closely, his nose buried in the nap of Emma’s neck.</p>
<p>“What is?” murmured Emma distractedly.</p>
<p>“It’s strange. I don’t know if it’s real or not – ” Irvan mumbled sluggishly, his nose deeply inhaling her body scent. “- why you smell so good like this…”</p>
<p>Emma, who listened to his words calmly, lifted her arm to her nose and sniffed it. There was no smell thanks to the water. Then what on earth had he smelled?</p>
<p>Though Emma wasn’t completely sure, Irvan seemed to like it, so she decided to keep quiet about it but soon changed her mind. She had fallen victim to his jokes before, and this time she would return the favor.</p>
<p>Emma opened her eyes, an impish look in them as the corners of her mouth rose. Glancing back at him, she said, “Are you saying that because you have fallen for me?”</p>
<p>His eyes widened. “Fallen for you?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You fell in love with me at first sight.”</p>
<p>Irvan chuckled when she clowned him. “That’s nonsense.” As soon as the light gust of air from his nostrils grazed her neck, a sweet shudder flowed through her shoulders and back.</p>
<p>“Nonsense indeed. That you’ve fallen in love with me. Don’t try to back down now.”</p>
<p>“If I mistook your scent because I am in love with you, then my condition is critical.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, it <em>is</em> critical.” She talked rather coyly, with her chin slightly lifted. “Admit it. It’s because you have fallen in love with me. It’s not enough to threaten me not to disappear in front of your eyes for a single moment, so you even followed me to the bathtub.”</p>
<p>“Your confidence astonishes me.”</p>
<p>Before Emma could say anything, he jerked at her waist, pulling her in from below. Because of that, her hand almost slipped on the tub edge.</p>
<p>“Whoa!”</p>
<p>When the water sloshed around and splashed her in the face due to the sudden movement, she struggled for a moment. Then, after catching her balance she, like a child, splashed Irvan with water.  After starting the water battle, Irvan later joined, not wanting to lose.</p>
<p>With the golden bright sunlight filtering into the long window, Emma wondered if all this was a dream: seeing the fine water droplets flying like crystals, and the handsome man beyond those with a pleasant smile. It was painfully beautiful.</p>
<p>What if this gorgeous man existed only in her fantasy? If this were not real, it would have been too cruel, too disturbing.</p>
<p>“By chance…” Emma, who had been staring at Irvan for a while in solemness, squinted at him and muttered, “It isn’t really critical, is it?”</p>
<p>“Did you say critical?” He laughed. “That’s equivalent to faries terrorizing the Perrigans Mountains.”</p>
<p>Seeing that he had shattered the disturbance with a bitter remark, Irvan was definitely <em>not</em> in critical condition. But if Irvan were the servant of a twisted fairy who enjoyed pulling cruel pranks, he would have just let her have a beautiful dream. And if she were to wake from this dream… she wouldn’t know what awaited her.</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>“What are you saying?” Irvan, still embracing her at the waist, pulled Emma closer. And when he did, she became positioned on top of him. Only then did she felt something large and hard poking around her bottom and inner thighs.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Emma lowered her gaze to discover an overly erect, thick member beneath the surface of the water, nodding and swaying against the net of light.</p>
<p>“Look.” Irvan, who closely watched Emma’s eyes get bigger, chuckled. “There’s no way someone in critical condition would have something like this, right?”</p>
<p>“…It’s so… big.” Emma stuttered as if she was being strangled.</p>
<p>As it was distorted being below the water surface, his member, which had completely increased in size, was honestly incredibly large. How could such a huge thing go in and out of her deepest place?</p>
<p>“It’s really incredible…” The closer Emma looked at it, the more her lips fell open.</p>
<p>“It’s quite nice to hear your words of amazement,” he replied with a self-satisfied smirk, “It’s going to be incredible, <em>outrageously</em> incredible. And I proved my usefulness ability early on by satisfying you. By the way, why are you only looking at my thing?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“You’re staring at it wickedly, making me feel embarrassed.”</p>
<p>Emma had nothing else to say about it. If he was this victimized, she couldn’t even reply by telling him that he could look at hers.</p>
<p>But then, the corners of his handsome mouth twisted as if he had gotten a glimpse in Emma’s dirty thoughts. He suddenly wrapped his arms around her waist, and lifted Emma’s body out of the water.</p>
<p>“Get up,” he said.</p>
<p>“What?” she asked. He was still seated in the tub; Emma was the only one out.</p>
<p>“I said stand up straight.”</p>
<p>“W-why?”</p>
<p>When Emma put strength in her wrists to hold herself up the blue-gray eyes scanning her squinted. “You also saw as much as you wanted. Eye for an eye. So I get to look at you, too.”</p>
