            <p><strong>Chapter 80.1</strong></p>
<p>A sharp blade pierced Philip’s heart. He couldn’t believe it. As he blinked blankly, an indescribable sharp pain spread from his chest and constricted his breath. Finally, he fell over, coughing up blood.</p>
<p>“Burn him. Leave nothing behind,” Irvan commanded.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Irvan sheathed his sword and ordered the driver and coachman to dig shallowly around Philip’s corpse that was completely covered in blood. When that was done, several knights covered the corpse with firewood and poured oil on it.</p>
<p>As soon as the embers fell, the flames immediately engulfed the body and began to burn it, filling the air with a thick acrid smell. Irvan watched the process indifferently and then glanced back at the carriage, speaking clearly.</p>
<p>“In due time, spread the news that Philip Herman is missing. Ah, Otto and Dora will have a village chief in Somerville. We’ll handle it together when reporting his death.”</p>
<p>“All right. Please leave it to me.”</p>
<p>After Laute’s immediate answer, Irvan nodded his head and headed back to the countess.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Irvan returned late in the afternoon, Emma sniffed him, detecting a faint burnt smell. She tilted her head in curiosity.</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness, what smell is this?”</p>
<p>“I was wandering around the mountains earlier and came across people burning fields.”</p>
<p>Irvan took off his coat and handed it to the attendant, who ran to the laundry room, repulsed by the smell.</p>
<p>Emma went over to Irvan’s shoulder and put her nose to his shirt, taking in a shallow breath.</p>
<p>“You have to change your clothes. It smells bad. But if they’re burning fields, won’t it start a forest fire?”</p>
<p>“I was more concerned about safety than wildfire. It’s also a place where werewolves often appear, and it was originally uninhabited. They asked me if they could clear the fields there, and I said it would be fine.”</p>
<p>After Uncle Phillip had left earlier, Roham appeared and reported that there was a fire near the Ferragen Mountains and people had been discovered. When Laute, who was next to him, made a fuss about the fire, Irvan and the two of them immediately got on horseback and set off to investigate the situation.</p>
<p>“You are a generous lord.” As she said that, Emma untied the knot on Irvan’s shirt.</p>
<p>“Hey. I’m learning about generosity from my wise wife.”</p>
<p>Emma received the new clothes brought by the attendant and handed them over to Irvan one by one, and he was delighted as she fussed over him.</p>
<p>“Your hair smells too, so what about this? Should I spray some perfume on? We have to host a dinner soon.”</p>
<p>“Do whatever you want to. If my wife likes it, then I like it too.”</p>
<p>At that, Emma smiled happily and instructed Jenna to bring her perfume.</p>
<p>As soon as Jenna brought the perfume, Emma sprayed Irvan with it gracefully. The perfume was made by Emma herself, and it had a faint sweet scent due to its main ingredient: luphenyl.</p>
<p>“How is it?”</p>
<p>“How is what?”</p>
<p>“The scent. I made it because I thought you liked it.”</p>
<p>Straightening up, Irvan raised his nose and sniffed the scent in the air.</p>
<p>Irvan was taller than ever, and with the lightly scented perfume on, he looked more handsome than a prince. Perhaps because he had changed into fresh clothes and looked dashing.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s nice.”</p>
<p>“Is that all?” Irvan asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Emma replied absentmindedly. As she looked up at the dazzlingly handsome Irvan, she felt a twinge of happiness.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing she had to point out. Ever since she heard the details from Jenna, Emma had been wondering why she was able to stay safe from Irvan, who had been quarantined because of insanity.</p>
<p>The first time she knocked on the front door of the Lodge, Irvan was extremely out of it. Then, when she went to take a closer look, he muttered something to her.</p>
<p><em>‘I don’t know. I told you I don’t know yet.’</em></p>
<p>Emma wasn’t in a hurry at the time and didn’t think deeply about what he meant, but now that she thought about it, she wondered if Irvan, who was addicted to red matgal, could have muttered something about the luphenyl he smelled on her.</p>
<p>While she had been travelling in the carriage, she had been drinking luphenyl tea before falling asleep.</p>
<p>So, when she obtained large amounts of luphenyl from her uncle Philip, she tried making luphenyl perfume.</p>
<p>It was to clear the little doubt she had in her heart.</p>
<p>“Do you have anything else to say about it?”</p>
<p>“It just smells pretty good. Nothing else. What else do you need me to say?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
