            <p><strong>Chapter 15.2</strong></p>
<p>“You’re quite good at kissing.”</p>
<p>When she was suddenly praised, the heat rose to her mouth. Emma was lost for words. <em>Is he saying that because I wasn’t able to kiss him like this the other night? Maybe I didn’t kiss him properly because I was drunk…</em></p>
<p>‘Uh…you too,” she gasped out awkwardly. Emma, whose face was red, barely gasped the words out. The man smiled and then let out a small laugh. When he smiled that brightly, he looked so young.</p>
<p>Emma stared up at him and smiled. It was blinding. The more she looked at him, the more she found him fascinating and handsome. She wanted to keep gazing at him and imprint him in her own mind. She wanted to remember him like this, smiling and bright. His skin was pale, he had a sharp jaw and a proud nose. His eyes were deep and his lips sensuous. There was no hint of his usually hard expression. He looked soft and innocent.</p>
<p>“When you smile, you’re unbelievably handsome,” said Emma, without realizing that she had uttered those words out loud. She also realized that this might be why she might have agreed to spend the night with him when she was drunk.</p>
<p>“Really?” he asked. “Do you really think that?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she answered. There was nothing to doubt about that statement.</p>
<p>“I know I look quite nice. But hearing you say it so eloquently is something else. So, do you like me?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said at once.</p>
<p>Emma who had been staring up at the man with a coy face was taken aback with herself. <em>I wonder what he thinks of me now.</em></p>
<p>“How about me? Do you like me?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know yet,” said the man, smirking. He was wicked, alright.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p><em>You spent the whole night, but you don’t know yet? </em>Emma seethed. <em>It’s a yes or no question! </em>The mystery of it didn’t last long in her mind because the man lowered his lips on hers and her thoughts scattered away.</p>
<p>“First of all, I know that I like you more than the alcohol I love,” he said.</p>
<p><em>Alcohol?</em> While Emma blinked in surprise, the man kissed her deeply, letting off a moan as though he were exclaiming. Emma fell deeply in him without any reluctance. Her body soared with desire that was building within her.</p>
<p>“Strangely, I am attracted to you more than I have ever been with others,” he whispered, deepening his kisses. It was the same for Emma. She didn’t know why she was so attracted to him. Was it because they had already spent a night together?</p>
<p>Emma responded to the kiss with enthusiasm on her part, willing to give the same pleasure that he gave her. They were intertwined together. It was amazing and exciting to feel the same as the man.</p>
<p>Emma responded to the kiss with enthusiasm, willing to accept the pleasure given to her.</p>
<p>“The more I touch you, the thirstier I get,” he said, his tongue savouring the feel of her lips, her tongue and the inside of her mouth. “I want to taste you. Continuously.”</p>
<p>As though he was afraid, he kissed her with a violent tenderness. As their hearts raced, the tangled tongue slid and rose with each other. From deep within her, Emma’s body reacted with an overwhelming feeling. As his tongue rubbed against hers, Emma felt her lower part of the body loosed drowsily.</p>
<p>Suddenly his thigh hardened, and she felt the hard crotch against her that burned hotly. When their tongues met, her body tightened deep within her and her nerves burned like wildfire. As if all senses were in full bloom, the inside of the thigh was all wet, and their breath became ragged.</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>Emma felt drunk in ecstasy. Emma gasped. “More,” she said.</p>
<p>“Open your mouth so I can shove it in.”</p>
<p>Emma gasped and accepted his tongue. Her back flinched as his thick tongue penetrated deep into her throat.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>As his tongue played with her, the insides of her thighs were completely wet now. His passionate kiss melted her completely. As his tongue teased her, Emma’s body tingled causing her to tremble.</p>
<p>A shudder spread from her lower abdomen to her spine and a moan escaped her lips. As though that was the only signal he needed, the man’s hand released her waist and travelled up her body. He caressed her arms and shoulder and wrapped his hands around her chest. Even with the fabric between his hands and her skin, she was stimulated. His hard touch aroused her. His big hands crushed her mound softly. Emma gasped as the sensual touch. The thrill of the touch sent her reeling.</p>
