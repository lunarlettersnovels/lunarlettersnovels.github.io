            <p><strong>Chapter 28.2</strong></p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>When his soft tongue approached her passionately and twisted with hers, her already heated body reacted with more excitement. The pleasure that began with a smale, swirling dlame rose again like wildfire; her nether region began to get wet.</p>
<p>“Bend over, Emma,” he mumbled huskily, withdrawing his lips and stealing one last kiss.</p>
<p>As if possessed, Emma gently fell to the bed on all fours and bent over as he had said.</p>
<p>“Raise your bottom.”</p>
<p>She raised her bottom, her back arched. In an instant, she could feel Irvan’s presence from behind her. He raised her dress slowly, dragging the textile against her flesh which raised in goosebumps. He spread her thighs with his large hands, exposing her warm flesh to air, making her tremble. Then he pressed his fingers against the supple flesh of her bottom/ He caressed Emma’s flesh, and put his face close to it as if he were savoring the feeling of her softness.</p>
<p>“Ahh…”</p>
<p>When his moist breath touched her, the pleasure swirled through her cr*tch, and a burning sensation seemed to spread all over her body. She was already soaking, trembling finely, when her petals were gently spread open by Irvan.</p>
<p>Emma shuddered at the touch of his wet tongue her wet folds. For a moment, her arms almost gave out from below her.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Ohh!”</p>
<p>Emma’s bottom was l*wdly exposed as she laid face down. He added more pressure to his hands holding her bottom apart, so he could gain more access. Irvan buried his face near her garden, pulled her thin und*rw*ar to the side. Emma could feel his hot breath hit her exposed petals.</p>
<p>“Oh…” The unexpected moan that rose from his throat spread over her wet folds. He was too close.</p>
<p>“Yes, oh! Ah…” The unfamiliar stimulation caused by the crude position caused the inside of her thighs to shudder, and her toes to spread. “Ah… no! This is too weird.” Emma stretched her arm back and pushed him down, but he only caught her wrist.</p>
<p>“What is weird? It’ll only get better,” Irvan said, his low and smooth voice unmasking his own desire. “Your wet p*ssy is begging for me to taste it quickly.”</p>
<p>After saying so, Emma could feel his long, warm tongue poke it. He dragged his tongue along the length of her folds. His tongue licking her hot flesh was slightly cooler and stimulated her so, and Emma’s back instantly arched at the unmistakeable pleasure. The deeper she arched and the more Irvan licked her, the more pleasurable it became.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes!”</p>
<p>The annoying dress that covered her came right off. Irvan, who looked down at the lady who had become naked at some point, opened her petals wide and carefully licked the wet hole.</p>
<p>“A lot of liquid is flowing from the hole.” He said. “So pretty.” As he poked at it with his tongue, an obscene splashing sound filled the room.</p>
<p>Emma couldn’t withstand the repetitive movement that seemed to stimulate all of her sensitive parts. The pleasure made her dizzy, her eyes hazy. Her back constantly trembled and arched at the sensation rising from her secret, deep place.</p>
<p>“Nghh…!”</p>
<p>A series of m*ans burst forth from Emma’s lips. Irvan’s hold that kept her from moving every time she twisted around was affectionate and firm.  Her whole body was about to ripen and burst forth with flaming excitement.</p>
<p>“Mmmh! Oh, yes!”</p>
<p>Emma, who had been m*aning faintly as he continuously touched her, eventually lost strength in her knees and collapsed on the bed. At one moment, her entire vision had turned white.</p>
<p>Then Irvan grabbed her waist and raised her again. Irvan firmly held her waist, but there was no strength left in her as she had reached org*sm quickly. Not caring that Emma was wobbling, Irvan stabled her body and settled her thighs between his head. When Emma looked behind, it looked like she was straddling Irvan’s handsome face. Her body was arched and her thighs held by Irvan’s strong grip. He moved his chin and pushed his tongue into her wet hole.</p>
<p>“Delicious,” he said devilishly. He straightened his tongue and pressed it on her sensitive nub, then stuck it back again inside her hole, sucking as he had done with her peaks.</p>
<p>“Yes! Ah! Ohh!”</p>
<p>Emma bent her neck at the unbearable, intense stimulation and gave off a coquettish m*an. Everywhere his lips touched, her wet flesh became hot, suffocating her.</p>
<p>He licked around her petals like a madman dying of thirst. He licked and sucked from her sensitive, pink numb to her gaping, aching slippery hole, teasing her with his skillful tongue. The er*tic stimulation struck her with a frightening pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Yes!” she almost sobbed. Emma’s heart thumped furiously against her chest as if she had run a race. She gasped at the ecstacy that climbed up her chest. Emma shivered with pleasure as did her round peaks, suspended from her curved body.</p>
<p>“Keep it coming,” Irvan growled. “So I can taste more.”</p>
<p>Irvan pressed his tongue down on the pink numb that trembled in the center of her wet flesh, and then he rubbed his lips hard on it. “Sweet juice keeps coming out of your p*ssy.”</p>
<p>At that moment, a mind-numbing pleasure permeated the inside of Emma’s lower abdomen, and her knees loosened at the sweet, explosive release. Emma lost all strength in her knees, her thighs almost collapsing back on the sheets when Irvan grabbed her pelvis and propped her bottom upright. Then his hand snaked in between her thighs, opening her petals wide, stealing one last lick on her shivering garden.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>Emma thought she was going crazy. Eventually, she collapsed. She trembled for a long time basked in a wave of pleasure that she couldn’t bear.</p>
<p>Irvan licked his wet lips as if he were dying of thirst, and raised his body. Then, he loomed from behind her, grabbing both sides of her hips as if he was about to devour Emma once more.</p>
