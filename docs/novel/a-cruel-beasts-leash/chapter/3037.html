            <p><strong>Chapter 70.1</strong></p>
<p>Karina seemed to become hopeful when she saw Irvan show up. She got up, looking more animated than before.</p>
<p>“Is the delegation here already?” she asked. It seemed like she was eagerly waiting for the delegation to arrive from Barron Muns for negotiation. “It looks like the news about me has reached my clan!” she continued.</p>
<p>Irvan merely replied in a clipped tone, “Write.”</p>
<p>Karina raised her eyebrow. “What? Write what?” she said, a sneer almost forming on her lips.</p>
<p>Irvan threw writing utensils he brought from Karina’s bedroom on the table. “Who knows? Anything.  A will would be good.”</p>
<p>“Captain! How can you say such a thing to her!”</p>
<p>The red haired maid was outraged at Irvan’s cold words. The maid stood in front of Karina like a hen protecting its chick.</p>
<p>“The trial is over! Please leave if you’re going to say things like that! Now!”</p>
<p>Karina, who looked calm while looking at Irvan with the maid between them, mumbled to herself, sounding disappointed.</p>
<p>“Then the delegation isn’t here? How strange… My clan wouldn’t be so slow, but it’s fine. I just have to go to the capital. Everything will be smoothly handled there. It might be a bit complicated to handle matters here.”</p>
<p>“Where did you have the notion that you’re going to the capital?”</p>
<p>“Mmf-”</p>
<p>Irvan raised his brow at Karina’s barely concealed laughter. The latter smiled at him, her mouth turning into a sneer. “Isn’t that obvious? I’m going to request a reinvestigation to His Majesty. Thankfully my family has quite a connection, so it seems possible.”</p>
<p>“You’re planning on stalling.”</p>
<p>“Of course. I want to live as long as I can. Unlike <em>someone</em>.”</p>
<p>Karina spoke, thick-faced. She crossed her arms and smiled, daring Irvan to do what he could. The rings on her fingers reflected in the candlelight.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to talk then,” he said.</p>
<p>Irvan opened the writing utensil himself. Inside were a fancy paper and envelope, pen, ink, paper knife and sealing wax. Irvan looked down at it expressionless and searched his pocket.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do? Madam won’t be writing a will. She won’t be writing anything.”</p>
<p>Irvan didn’t pay attention to the annoying maid. He took out a pair of black gloves anda  handkerchief. He carefully placed the gloves on his hands. The maid felt something was wrong.</p>
<p>“W-what are you doing? I’m calling someone!” she blurted out.</p>
<p>“You can try.”</p>
<p>Irvan responded drily and took out a paper knife.</p>
<p>“What are you trying to do? You won’t be forgiv…. ah, ah!”</p>
<p>The red-haired maid wasn’t able to finish her sentence. The paper knife instantly crossed the air and was stabbed into its owner’s left chest.</p>
<p>“W-what are you…”</p>
<p>Karina looked down at the paper knife on her chest and stumbled.</p>
<p>“Uh, ah….!”</p>
<p>“Ah, mm-!”</p>
<p>The maid’s scream was instantly stopped as she was punched in the gut.</p>
<p>“You’re so loud. You should shut up as well.”</p>
<p>Irvan shoved his handkerchief into the maid’s mouth. He walked to where Karina was and took out the paper knife. Blood gushed out. As Irvan put the maid’s body in front of him like a shield, the maid struggled as she witnessed her master’s eyes slowly dim with life. Finally, Karina collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p>Irvan put the bloody paper knife on the maid’s hand. He made her clench it. The maid, whose mouth was still covered by Irvan, was trembling.</p>
<p>“Good, I think this is a good position. It’s a good angle.”</p>
<p>Irvan moved behind the maid, grabbed the maid’s hand that was holding the knife and swung it hard.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Ugh!” The maid struggled as Irvan had her cut the carotid on her neck with her own hand.</p>
<p>“I know it’ll hurt, but hold on.”</p>
<p>Irvan used the knife in the maid’s hand to lightly stab under her chin and ears.</p>
<p>“Since there’s no way a first timer could succeed in suicide, there should be scar for hesitation.”</p>
<p>Each time the knife sliced her skin, there were scars. The maid was struggling in the midst of all this.</p>
<p>“Sh, be calm. The pain is nothing when you’re dead.”</p>
<p>The maid who was covered in blood lost her conscience in the end and collapsed.</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>Irvan looked at the two women on the floor.</p>
<p>“This should be better right?” He mumbled and moved the two bodies and made the red hair maid and Karina look at each other. “Commiting suicide together. Tsk, what a shame.”</p>
