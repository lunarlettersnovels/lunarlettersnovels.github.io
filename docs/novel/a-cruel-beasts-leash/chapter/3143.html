            <p><strong>Chapter 16.2</strong></p>
<p>Emma, swayed by his skillful teasing, felt dizzy and heady. She trembled and m*aned. But as he continued, she could no longer hold back. “Uhh…ohh!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>The shaking did not stop. The heat flowed down from her thigh to her knew to her toes. She curled up her toe in pleasure. As she shuddered and trembled under him, the man removed his lips from her chest and glanced at her.</p>
<p>Their eyes met. One blurred in ecstasy and the other clear as day. “Was it good?” he asked, “Are you satisfied?” He directed a smirk at her. His mouth was glossy from saliva. “Since you aren’t answering, perhaps I should work harder to stimulate you more.”</p>
<p>He pressed the pap*lla, which had already turned red and erect, with the tip of his tongue and licked it. She moaned.</p>
<p>“It’s good to hear you m*an,” he whispered, hoarsely.</p>
<p>Emma who groaned and m*aned looked at the man  who coveted her through blurry eyesight. When his tongue descended on her tip once again, Emma was reduced to panting and m*aning.</p>
<p>The man, encouraged, twisted his mouth and absorbed the pink pap*lla rising in his mouth. His tongue teased the tip and rubbed it. It was ticklish. Emma was swept up in breathtaking pleasure.</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Emma shook her head to bring herself back to her senses. Her thighs trembled and her toes were numb from curling them over and over again. She felt something wet between her legs.</p>
<p>“That’s a nice view.” The man had taken off his lips from her chest and was staring at the rising and falling of her chest as she tried to breath normally. The tip of her br*asts were red and sensitive by now because of his teasing. She saw them reflected in his blue eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s the same color as my lips now,” he said.</p>
<p>As though he wasn’t satisfied with his work, he opened his palms and gathered her bre*asts into them. “They are beautiful,” he whispered. Emma tried not to lose her mind at his touch. He blew on them. The cool air made Emma flinch.</p>
<p>He let go of Emma’s hand with a deep moan. Emma was surprised. The man grabbed her slender waist with his other hand and lowered his eyes towards the triangle below her belly. The sight of her seemed to make his eyes glow excitedly.</p>
<p>He gazed at her privates and Emma was filled with sudden embarrassment. She felt very shy and exposed. When she twisted her body and tried to turn the other side, the man firmly held her fast. His eyes seemed to be probing at the target.</p>
<p>The back of Emma’s neck tingled in excitement as the tension grew. Her senses were on fire, her nerves frayed. Emma didn’t know if she was embarrassed or yearning in anticipation.</p>
<p>As Emma grappled with the mix of emotions she felt, she was suddenly lifted into the air. “This posture is uncomfortable,” he said as he laid Emma on the sofa. He leaned down and nudged Emma’s ankle to pry her legs open. “You look delicious,” he said as she spread her legs further open and dove his head between them.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…” Emma felt flustered. Emma instinctively tried to clamp her legs shut, but he gently nudged them apart as his face was already in her privates.</p>
<p>“Please, don’t look!” protested Emma.</p>
<p>“The more you refuse me, the more I want to see.”</p>
<p>Emma tried to squirm away, but his hands held her in place. His other hand explored her inner thighs. His fingers probed her most intimate parts. Her most private and intimate parts were exposed.</p>
<p>“Pretty,” he sighed. Emma tried to avoid closing her legs up. The man chuckled. Contrary to Emma, who felt flustered and shy, the man gazed at her private parts in wonder. Then he took a deep breath, taking in her smell. His thin eyelids were only half open, his blue eyes looked drowsy as though drunk.</p>
<p>“I kept saying there was a darker scent somewhere, and I guess it comes from here.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>He lowered his head between her legs and plunged his tongue in.</p>
