            <p><strong>Chapter 55.2</strong></p>
<p><em>‘I’m sure they will try this kind of thing again,’ </em>Emma thought furiously. Once an insidious attempt failed, there was a strong possibility of a second attempt. Now that they have the castle in their grasp, it was the best time to plot. Until the Muns siblings take over everything, Irvan has to be kept alive to produce an heir for them. This must have been the reason why they sparingly used ‘Red Matgal’, which was fatal to health.</p>
<p><em>‘They are treating Irvan as someone disposable.’ </em>She already experienced and knew about the vileness of Countess Karina, hidden behind a beautiful and elegant mask, but when she saw this ruthless and naked nature, anger grew from within. Emma clenched her fists. <em>‘Irvan saved my life.’ </em>It was Emma’s turn to help him.</p>
<p>Emma, who exhaled to cool off her anger, rolled up her arms, determined that she would definitely extract the Red Matgal ingredient from the water bottle and use it as the proof of a terrible conspiracy.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>A whole night passed by in the basement. Emma had been holding the water bottle for a long time and was engrossed in analyzing the ingredients. Even though she concentrated so hard, she only suffered countless failures. She used all her knowledge but there was no tangible result. But she couldn’t stop. Emma clenched her teeth and concentrated more.</p>
<p>It was only in the afternoon of the next day that she was miraculously able to succeed in extracting the Red Matgal component with a specially designed reagent.</p>
<p>“It’s done now!” When everything was done, only then did she felt that her whole body was utterly exhausted, like she had just gotten out from a long marathon.</p>
<p>“Shall I take you to your room?” As Emma was struggling, Jenna tried to stabilize her carefully.</p>
<p>“No, thank you. I’ll just rest for a while and go up.”</p>
<p>Emma was barely taking a breather, trying to brush away the dizziness, when suddenly she heard a murmur from outside. An exasperated voice, the sound of heavy shoes hitting the ground. The estate was quickly engulfed in an uneasy atmosphere. Feeling something unusual, Emma rose from her seat and approached the window. The sound of chaos pierced her ears clearly.</p>
<p>“No, you can’t!”</p>
<p>“I can’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Put him away!”</p>
<p>The noise of many people rushing around seemed to spread through the window to the basement, but it soon got closer to the basement door.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Jenna also felt something was strange, so she stopped what she was doing and blinked. “Shall I go out?”</p>
<p>Emma felt apprehensive. “Yes… we need to find out what’s going on-”</p>
<p>While Emma was midway through her sentence, the tightly closed basement door opened with a force.</p>
<p>“Emellin Herman!”</p>
<p>The man who introduced himself as a bailiff suddenly shouted. “So you were hiding here!” The man commanded the soldiers, “Capture the criminal immediately!”</p>
<p>“What criminal?! What mistake…?”</p>
<p>“What’s the crime?” Emma stepped back, pretending to ask in surprise, with her eyes wide open. Then she leaned his back against the shelf. Secretly, she reached behind her back and quickly grabbed the small pocket she had left on the front of the shelf.</p>
<p>“Your crime? Ha!” The bailiff, who narrowed his eyes towards Emma, bluntly replied, “You’ll find out when you get to the castle. Take her now.”</p>
<p>“Let go of me!” Emma yelled scornfully as the soldiers rushed in. “I’m telling you to let go of me!”</p>
<p>Emma struggled and resisted, but soon the knights rushed in and overpowered her. As her whole body was tied up with ropes, Emma bit her lip and glared fiercely at the soldiers around her.</p>
<p>“What’s the meaning of this?!”</p>
<p>Baron Berne heard the news late and came to the basement. The bailiff suddenly became polite and answered with courtesy, “Baron Berne. This is a command from above. It would be advantageous for Miss Herman to cooperate well.”</p>
<p>“You can’t do this! Miss Herman is our guest!” Baron Berne thundered. However, no matter how much Baron and Baroness Berne protested, the bailiff was stubborn.</p>
<p>“I am just following orders,” the bailiff replied curtly. With an arrogant gesture, he ordered Emma to be taken out of the basement. “I’m carrying out my official duties. You can file a complaint to the main castle.” The bailiff, who stood in the way as if to block their  captured Emma, gave instructions to the other soldiers, “Take all the evidence!”</p>
<p>“Yes!” As the soldiers stormed into the room, Jenna froze with a panicked look on her face and quickly exchanged glances with Emma. Emma gestured with her eyes quickly. <em>‘The water bottle!’</em> As Emma gave her silent instruction, Jenna quickly nodded.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch it carelessly! My stuff is here too!” Jenna made a fuss by waving her arms and hands in front of the soldier. She covertly dropped the water bottle behind the desk, hurriedly grabbed Emma’s important items and notebook, took it to her seat, then quickly backed away. The soldiers had papers with something written on them in their hands and started to pick things up. When Emma saw that one of the soldiers had taken the water bottle used in the Berne estate, she was relieved.</p>
<p>“I will definitely complain about this,” Baron Berne furiously said.</p>
<p>“Do as you please. There will be punishment later, so please come to court.” Baron Berne’s brow furrowed at the Bailiff’s arrogant tone.</p>
<p>Emma, tightly-bound, was taken away by a carriage. Baron Berne, who was frowning with a pale face, took out his fountain pen and quickly scribbled a note. He handed it to one of his knights and instructed him to set off on horseback in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Will she be all right?” Baroness Berne anxiously asked. She was hugging a startled Evelyn in her arms. The Baron only had his mouth pressed into a thin line. To ensure Miss Herman’s safety during Irvan’s absence, he had made her stay in the Berne estate. He couldn’t believe things could go wrong so suddenly. He had to let Irvan know about this quickly. It was urgent.</p>
