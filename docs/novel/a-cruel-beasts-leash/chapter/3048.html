<p><em><strong>Chapter 64.2</strong></em></p>
<p>Irvan nodded his head expressionlessly. It was a neat affirmation.</p>
<p>The prosecutor licked his lips and asked, “Could you elaborate on the situation again? What did you testify?”</p>
<p>Irvan calmly opened his mouth, “I testified exactly what I saw. Chairman Collin ran to the window and jumped. It happened so quickly that there was no time for me to comprehend what was happening or stop him.”</p>
<p>“Hmm….” The prosecutor looked down at the papers in his hand and carefully objected. “Many witnesses who returned to the scene said Mr. Irvan was sitting in a chair. Could you please explain why?”</p>
<p>“I visited Chairman Collin because there was something I wanted to discuss with him. I sat because I thought it would take a long time.”</p>
<p>“What did you want to discuss?”</p>
<p>“It’s personal.”</p>
<p>Irvan spoke flatly in an icy voice, and the prosecutor could not pry deeper. He was terribly afraid. So he continued talking about the primary topic, habitually wiping his cold sweat.</p>
<p>“But you said Chairman Collin suddenly jumped?”</p>
<p>“There has been a lot of evidence. I will refrain from talking about it.”</p>
<p>“Uh-um-”</p>
<p>Countess Karina’s eyes narrowed as the prosecutor stuttered. The flustered prosecutor calmed his stomach and spoke out loud, “No. I ask you to explain properly. The prosecution identifies Capitan Irvan as a strong suspect. What I have just said is an important question that could influence future judgments. Be sure to clearly speak your mind with ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Did the chairman jump off?”</p>
<p>With a sneer on his face, Irvan simply said, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“What did you talk about with Chairman Collin before he jumped out of the window?”</p>
<p>“We didn’t talk about much. It was the incident in the dungeon. As the Knight Commander, I have to pay attention to matters related to security in the castle.”</p>
<p>“That’s not something personal at all.”</p>
<p>“I put it that way because it’s related to my job.”</p>
<p>“…I see.” As if running away from Irvan’s cold gaze, the prosecutor turned his gaze to the judge.</p>
<p>“If he is ready, I approve,” the judge said. As soon as the judge’s words fell, the side door in the middle of the audience room opened. The figure which appeared through the gaps, was small and stocky, but unlike his poor appearance, he was well-dressed like a nobleman. He was the exclusive doctor of Van Wert castle, Monte.</p>
<p>The people were intrigued as they watched Monte come into the courtroom. It looked like things were going to become more interesting. Standing on the tribunal as a witness, Monte respectfully paid a greeting to Countess Karina and the bishop. Then, he briefly showed courtesy to the audience, and cleared his throat as if he was fully prepared.</p>
<p>“Mr. Bilod Monte.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Everyone knows, but I’ll ask you to confirm again. Are a doctor at Van Wert’s castle?”</p>
<p>Monte gave a clear answer to the prosecutor’s question. “That’s right,” he said.</p>
<p>“What was Mr. Collin’s physical condition? Including his mental health.”</p>
<p>Despite the curiosity of the people, Monte looked confident without any sign of being intimidated or dispirited.</p>
<p>“He was extremely healthy. His body was also full of vitality. Mentally, he was cheerful and sociable, such that he was enterprising and motivated in everything. He carefully examined many important issues within the territory, and vigorously pursued big projects,” Monte replied.</p>
<p>“Did the deceased receive regular medical treatment?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The chairman received medical treatment two or three times a month, and I saw him on the morning of the incident.”</p>
<p>“Were there any signs of abnormalities?”</p>
<p>“No. He was briefly shocked by the werewolf accident, but the Chairman was the same as usual.”</p>
<p>“I see.” After asking Monte some questions, the prosecutor carefully looked at the documents and started flipping through them. He then tapped a page with his fingertips and lifted his head. “You have reported here that an abnormal lesion was found as a result of the autopsy. Do you confirm this?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Monte affirmed in a confident voice.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me what kind of lesion it is?”</p>
<p>“It’s <em>Livor mortis</em>.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>When asked the question, Monte suddenly took out a monocle with a cautious expression and put it over his nose. He opened his mouth, drawing his hands in the air, as if to make himself look authoritative and informed.</p>
<p>“<em>Livor mortis</em> is a term that refers to the signs that appear on the dead body, and it takes on various aspects depending on the application of pressure or the change of state. For example, if it turns black, it can be inferred as poisoning. In the case of the chairman, a prominent <em>Livor mortis</em> appeared on the neck. This means that significant pressure was applied to the neck just before or at the time of death.”</p>
<p>The prosecutor, who listened carefully to the words, turned over the documents and read down the page. He touched one part with his fingertips and tapped it.</p>
<p>“The deceased fell on the farm implements loaded in the cart at the time, and his body was badly damaged. Could the shock put pressure on the neck and cause <em>Livor mortis</em> to appear?”</p>
<p>“No. That is not possible in this case. This is because the traces of pressure applied to the neck are specific. A strangled death is commonly referred to as strangulation, but that’s when a string-like instrument is used, and in this case it is strangling.”</p>
<p>“And what does that mean?” The prosecutor blinked and asked.</p>
<p>At this, Monte opened his mouth with a solemn, professional look. “The act of using the body or strangling the neck with hands,” he replied.</p></div>
