            <p><strong>Chapter 18.2</strong></p>
<p>Her vision blurred. She was only aware of the large, throbbing thing inside her. Her inner walls were all moist and a liquid surrounded the thing inside her. As the pain subsided, Emma’s body relaxed. The man, taking it as an encouragement, kissed Emma feverishly.</p>
<p>“Ah, mmmm.”</p>
<p>She could feel the heat rising in her inner walls as his member rubbed against it, creating a sweet pleasure that she had never felt before. The pleasure spread in waves through her whole being.</p>
<p>The sound of their soaked bodies together rung around the room.</p>
<p>“Getting hot,” mumbled the man as if amazed.</p>
<p>Each time his thrust, it touched her somewhere which made her tremble in pleasure.</p>
<p>“It’s a good thing you’re so wet. Seeing you eat me up like this.” His obscene words didn’t faze her. She was only aware of the pleasure he gave her.</p>
<p>“You gobble me up so well.”</p>
<p>Emma couldn’t reply to him. She felt herself go blank, her thoughts scattered and let out a joyous breath.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Oh. Mmmmm.”</p>
<p>Her body arched and she was only just able to follow his movement. An uncontrollable feeling soared within her as his member rubbed against her insides. The pleasure soared.</p>
<p>His thrusts became frantic. His hard member scraped against her insides faster and the mounting pleasure sent her reeling. Her skin was so hot and feverish that she felt she might catch fire.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s too hot. Ahh,” his low voice mumbled. The handsome face of the man in front of the gasping Emma was ecstatic from all of the pleasure she gave him.</p>
<p>“…think I’m melting.”</p>
<p>The narrow inner walls contracted alarmingly. He thrust deep and slip it out again.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Oh,” he moaned. His breath on her cheek tickled her. She stared at him with shy eyes. She looked down to see his shaft. It was large and bulky, and it was half inside her. It was unbelievable to see it naked. She wondered how that huge thing ever went inside her.</p>
<p><em>How could such a terrifying, ferocious thing settle in her body so comfortably?</em></p>
<p>When she saw his hot and large member that was about to burst, Emma flinched and a tremor spread through her insides, contracting and relaxing. She suddenly pulled him closer, and his member penetrated her even deeper.</p>
<p>“Ah… Oh…” Emma couldn’t move as he thrust inside her with vigor.  Her breathing became ragged as his massive thing filled her insides. The man grabbed her waist and thrust fiercely. “Ahhh…” Emma moaned.</p>
<p>The heat built up drastically and rose inside her, coursing through her entire body. As he continued with his thrust, Emma started getting overwhelmed and felt dizzy. It felt as though she was going to melt away. She felt the pleasure course through her body, her whole body trembled.</p>
<p>Their flesh melted together. Emma didn’t mind the burning heat. Her vision blurred. Emma felt light and floaty as though she had entered a cloud.</p>
<p>“Ahhh. Yess. Oh!” she moaned.</p>
<p>Her whole body trembled. Her inner walls contracted and relaxed repeatedly trying to accommodate the flesh thrusting inside her. The pleasure waves kept rising within her.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s getting hotter and stickier.”</p>
<p>As the thick pillar of flesh strongly rubbed against the boiling inner walls, a deep pleasure wrapped around Emma’s whole body like a heavy, intoxicating poison.</p>
<p>“Ohhh!”</p>
<p>Emma shuddered. Each time she did, she felt a burning stir inside. Emma’s inner walls containing the tender and hot liquid heated up to bursting. Her blood vessels throbbed.</p>
<p>Unlike before, her body was dizzily excited at the thrill of it thrusting inside her. Following the man’s strong and fierce movements, the penetrated inner walls flapped and worked together. Their bodies intertwined together produced a vulgar noise. The man’s waist moved in a rhythm.</p>
