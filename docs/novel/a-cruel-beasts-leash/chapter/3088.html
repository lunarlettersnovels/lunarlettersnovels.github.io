<p><strong>Chapter 44.2</strong></p>
<p>“Miss Herman,” Her cold tone and scornful eyes pierced Emma. “Miss Herman, as you are a <em>guest</em> of Master Irvan, you are a guest of Van Wert Castle. Are you going to leave for the Berne family home and never come back?”</p>
<p>“…no,” Emma replied.</p>
<p>At that question, there was no room for disagreement. Emma was planning to come back to the annex upon Irvan’s return.</p>
<p>“You are expected to stay in Wert City for the time being, but there is a high probability that he will accompany you back when he returns, right? Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>Emma was discouraged by the Countess’ dignified tone, who seemed to embarrass her sharply for a reaction. She could only faintly shake her head with her lips shut.</p>
<p>“<em>Say it</em>,” Countess Karina’s voice cut through the air. “ You will return to Van Wert Castle with Irvan.”</p>
<p>“I will… Lady Karina.”</p>
<p>Countess Karina narrowed her eyes as if she’d already known that. Blatant contempt was present in her glare. “Hmm, all right. So I don’t want to hear from somewhere that I’ve neglected to serve my guests,” she said.</p>
<p>“No, no, that will never—”</p>
<p>Karina cut off whatever Emma was about to say with a simple hand wave. “I am not examining your intentions now, Miss Herman. And I would never do that. I just want you to remember the old saying that people of the world enjoy intriguing stories. Especially if there’s a rumor that there’s a feud inside the castle, everyone will be busy chomping on it. Do you remember that dirty look last time in the dinner hall? What do you think caused us to be engulfed in such a humiliating disturbance? That’s why…”</p>
<p>Karina had an unpleasant look on her face. She nibbled on her bottom lip before saying, “You must attend dinner today. That’ll be all.”</p>
<p>Emma was no longer allowed to speak. She noticed that the pressuring atmosphere was thick inside the office. It was a terrible reminder that Karina’s authority could crush her if she complained even one more word.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she acquiesced. “See you at dinner, Lady Karina. Then…”</p>
<p>Emma left the office after a formal departure. The countess, who had told her intention, did not prevent her from leaving for Baron Berne’s home at all.</p>
<p>She decided to wait until dinner after loading Baron Berne’s carriage with her luggage. This time she was wearing clothes for traveling, not her banquet dress. It was also because she had already shown people her banquet dress several times, and in Irvan’s absence, she realized that revealing or colorful dresses were perilous.</p>
<p>During the time left until dinner, Emma strolled through the vast backyard with Laute. The purpose of the tour was to see what herbs had grown because Layna had hinted last time that she had built a garden in the east corner of the backyard.</p>
<p>“There sure are lots of different kinds.” Emma admired as she looked throughout the garden filled with herbs.</p>
<p>Layna had said her specialization was in growing herbs, and that indeed was true. Citucas, blue hemlocks, nerriounters, pokesbobs, whispens, and barquidilis  – which were famous for their strict growth conditions – were blooming everywhere.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s amazing that even whispens are here,” </em>she thought.</p>
<p>It had grown fresh and well despite it being a plant that didn’t thrive in this climate. Emma was truly mesmerized. Because Layna’s shocking skills as a herbalist were now proven. Unlike Emma, who constantly looked around the garden with admiring eyes, Laute’s face looking at the flowerbed didn’t show signs of impressiveness.</p>
<p>“The flowers are pretty, and the grass is fresh,” he mumbled, sluggishly looking around, “And the smell…”</p>
<p>Emma warned him when she saw him carelessly moving his hands and pulling the leaves off. “Please don’t touch them that way. Everything you see here is medicinal,” she said sternly.</p>
<p>“Medicinal? By chance, are they poisonous, too?”</p>
<p>Emma let out a faint burst of laughter when the heavily shocked Laute backed away from the garden like a scared bunny. Contrary to Laute’s serious-looking appearance he acted immaturely from time to time.</p>
<p>“Herbs can become toxic if not used in moderation,” she nodded.</p>
<p>“And is this dangerous?” he replied. He shook his black-stained hands in a rattle, pushed up his monocle, and looked at her with a serious face.</p>
<p>Emma replied, fiddling with the purple leaves sticking out, “This here is an herb called cutaline, and it’s mainly used for neuralgia as an external agent. By the way, it’s harmful if you intake it with refined ingredients; it causes nerve paralysis. However, this kind of light contact doesn’t cause any problems.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s relaxing. Then I am safe?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Absolutely safe.”</p>
<p>“Whew,” Laute sighed. “Well, I was quite worried I’d die an untimely death.”</p>
<p>“That can’t happen. Suddenly there will be two innocent suspects.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm. Come to think of it, you’re right.” He nodded as if she had a point. “Miss Layna and you would be imprisoned as suspects in a murder; she created this place, and you led me to it.”</p>
<p>“Stop that. I don’t want to be locked up in an underground cell.”</p>
<p>“Heh-heh. You speak like someone who’s been there before, Miss Herman. Now that I see it, you have quite the suspicious past.”</p>
<p>“Hmph. Don’t you have to go there to know what it’s like?”</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose. And how many people are locked up because they love underground prisons? I’m sure they’re either innocent, been victimized, or have justified reasons.”</p>
<p>Walking alongside Laute in the garden, Emma suddenly stopped at a scent tickling the tip of her nose. It lingered precariously in the air.</p>
<p><em>‘This…’</em></p>
<p>It was a familiar scent.</p>
