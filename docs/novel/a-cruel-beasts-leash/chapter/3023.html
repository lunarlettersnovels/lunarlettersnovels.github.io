            <p><strong>Chapter 77.1 – R 18</strong></p>
<p>Slowly, he moved closer to her, his ar0usal pressing against her thighs. Emma could feel the dampness of her underwear, and Irvan remarked on it. When he pulled back the cloth covering her intimate area, she felt the cool air against her skin.</p>
<p>“I’m going crazy. It’s obscene,” Irvan whispered, his eyes dark and hungry as he looked at her exposed body. Emma felt a shiver run through her, a mix of anticipation and excitement.</p>
<p>“The word ‘first night’ is meaningless when the bride is drenched like this,” he said.</p>
<p>He pressed against her, the thick tip of his ar0usal making contact with her hot, wet flesh. Emma couldn’t help but look at the large mass between his legs.</p>
<p>She murmured, “You too.”</p>
<p>Irvan stopped moving and looked at her mischievously. “Me?”</p>
<p>“The groom is fiercely excited. Don’t you think the bride would be afraid?” Emma’s heart was racing and blood was pumping hastily through her veins.</p>
<p>“That could be so. So, you don’t like it?”</p>
<p>“No… Do you not like it because I’m wet?”</p>
<p>“How could I?” he replied, and then lowered his head to bury his face between her thighs. “<em>Don’t like it</em>? What disappointing words. I want to put my head down like this and taste you.”</p>
<p>Emma wanted to feel his warm breath on her intimate area, and soon his soft, wet tongue found its way inside her. She flinched as her back twisted, the sensation both soft and moist. Irvan lightly ran his tongue over her bright pink flesh, spreading her apart as if it was soaked in hot honey, and immediately began to focus on her core.</p>
<p>He licked and licked, the hard tip of his tongue pressing against the small bump that jutted out from the middle of her slit. When he touched her cl!t, Emma gasped, her slender waist slid upwards to welcome it. His cool tongue caressed her hot insides, causing them to pulse and flutter.</p>
<p>“Raise your butt up, Emma,” Irvan murmured, and Emma lifted her hips a little before he grabbed her pelvis and pulled her towards him. He pressed his face closer to her, his wet tongue pressing deeper and rubbing softly. The feeling of being licked softly was overwhelming.</p>
<p>She shuddered as her back twitched and her stomach tightened. The chilling yet sweet thrill of his touch spread all the way to the top of her head, and Emma couldn’t help but m0an in pleasure.</p>
<p>“You’re flinching,” Irvan murmured as he continued to tease her, licking her like sweet cream until she melted into a shapeless being with his wet tongue. “You keep asking me to lick you so lewdly. You’re dripping…”</p>
<p>His words filled with l*st as he continued to tease her, using his thick tongue to swirl around her cl!t and gently tease her. It felt like his soft touch would make her s*x melt and disappear.</p>
<p>With his tongue still wet with her fluids, Irvan moved to her cl1t0ris and pressed his hot lips around it, sucking and rolling the tip of his tongue softly. Emma squirmed as she felt her insides contracting with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Haaa!”</p>
<p>Emma exclaimed, throwing her body back and tightening her thighs. Her delicate waist twisted and flinched as Irvan continued to touch her, driving her closer to climax.</p>
<p>“It’s still not enough,” he murmured as his tongue drove into her clitoris and then slid downwards to spread her folds open, lustfully licking them. Emma moaned in pleasure as he rubbed her heat continuously.</p>
<p>With her folds spread open, wet with fluids and ready to be filled, Irvan licked them roughly, his tongue gliding over her flesh as if he was about to swallow her.</p>
<p>“You’re dripping even more…”</p>
<p>Irvan thrust his long, wriggling tongue into her tight hole, sucking and licking her skillfully. When he was not invading her hole, he was licking her entrance and her inner walls with the tip of his tongue.</p>
<p>“Your p*ssy is tightening because it’s excited,” he whispered as Emma m0aned, her excited hole quickly trembling and tightening. As his tongue thrust in and out of her entrance repeatedly, her pink swollen flesh flared in excitement with the stimulation.</p>
<p>“It’s delicious.” Irvan murmured as Emma’s cl!t trembled and shook with pleasure. Cream overflowed between them.</p>
<p>“Haa, Emma…” Irvan called to her. Emma’s mind was blank with pleasure</p>
<p>His tongue ran between the flesh of her slit, tasting the delicious flowing liquid. Tasting Emma’s luscious and sens*al fluids, he suddenly lifted his chin and caressed her twitching nub with his soft tongue before lowering himself onto it. He licked upwards strongly and brushed downwards weakly over the cl1t0ris and entrance with a skillful caress. Every time he did that, Emma shot up, feeling sensitive.</p>
<p>“It’s too, ha… ngh…” she gasped, her hands grabbing the sheets as he stirred her luscious and sweet senses up without resistance.</p>
