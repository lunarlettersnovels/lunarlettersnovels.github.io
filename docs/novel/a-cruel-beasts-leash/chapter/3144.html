            <p><strong>Chapter 16.1</strong></p>
<p>When he teased her br*asts while grasping them, Emma shrank away with a m*an. However, he held her close and plunged his tongue deeper into her throat, swallowing her moan.</p>
<p>“Oh, ahh…”</p>
<p>Emma’s back arched and her chest met his further. Her mound became more sensitive in his grasp and she gasped. As the sensation build up, the man roughly pulled away her shirt revealing her quivering chest. His blue-grey eyes flashed with hunger.</p>
<p>“You seem to be already ar*used,” teased the man looking at her chest. Emma could feel his intense gaze all over her body. She tried to cover her body by pressing closer to him, but his gaze lingered on every inch of her skin. Emma suddenly felt shy and embarrassed.</p>
<p>Emma shyly avoided his eyes and tried to cover her chest with her arms, but his strong hands reached out and held her hands away. “They are beautiful. They seem to be teasing me to suck them.”</p>
<p>His words made her skin tingle. Her n*pples were already hard and turned towards him. It was perplexing to be so bare in front of a stranger and yet their desire was displayed in such specific details.</p>
<p>The man grabbed her slender wrists and raised both her hands and placed it on his neck. She clasped both her hands around his neck as though tied to him. Her chest perked up at the movement and the man let out a low m*an as though his was unable to resist any longer.</p>
<p>His lips touched her chest and Emma was unable to pull herself together. She gasped as his warm breath scattered over her skin, tickling her. His soft lips touched the apex of her mounds. Emma held him tighter. She felt ensnared.</p>
<p>It felt bare and vulnerable and yet it was full of passion. All Emma could think about was her nerves and how she wanted more. Her skin broke into goosebumps and her n*pples stood erect at his touch.</p>
<p>“If you do this, I can’t help it, you know…”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>His lips came down on her bre*st, warm and soft. It filled her with pleasure. “Shall I suck on it?” he asked.</p>
<p>Emma didn’t respond. What was one supposed to say to a question like that? “Tell me,” he whispered, “Do you want me to suck on them?”</p>
<p>Emma felt suddenly shy to answer and the man didn’t wait for a reply. His hot lips descended with a purpose and began teasing her there. Emma was gripped with such pleasure that she felt herself arch her back. She felt her inner thigh constrict, asking for more.</p>
<p>His hot lips teased her n*pples and gently clamped down on them. Emma winced and gasped. He then nibbled them softly and sucked on them sending Emma reeling. Her skin was hot and his hot tongue playing with her chest didn’t help make the situation any better.</p>
<p>His mouth on her chest tickled her and she felt like she was melting away because of all the heat building inside her. It was a dizzying sensation. Her skin broke into goosebumps. She felt hot and feverish.</p>
<p>But he wasn’t done. He teased the tip with his tongue, making them wet then nibbled and sucked on them sensing unbearable pleasure through her. Her body shivered and trembled. <em>Oh my god! </em>Emma was overwhelmed. She titled her head back and arched her back.</p>
<p>The feeling of his lips on his chest was so different than his kissed. Her privates throbbed in anticipation. It contracted and relaxed. Something wet trickled down her inner thigh.</p>
<p>As if enjoying her reactions, the man skillfully played with her chest and sucked them to stimulate her more. Emma’s thoughts scattered. She couldn’t make sense of anything anymore.</p>
<p>As Emma narrowed her shoulders in pleasure, the man nibbled softly and bit down hard on the tip and then sucked at them gently. It was as though he was picking at a fruit with his tongue. She felt her chest were trapped under his skillful exploration of her body.</p>
<p>Emma’s vision blurred and her lips and cheeks turned red with heat and excitement. When he continued with his ministrations, a swirl of pleasure took over Emma and she started feeling overwhelmed. A low m*an escaped her lips. As the dizzying sensation took over, the heat spread all over her body. All Emma could do was respond with another m*an as her body shook and shuddered.</p>
