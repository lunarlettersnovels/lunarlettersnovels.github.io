            <p><strong>Chapter 61.2</strong></p>
<p>As the servants waiting along the wall looked at Collin with worried expressions, Collin let out a short sigh. He soon signaled them with a simple gesture to back away. “As the commander said, wait in the hallway and come in as soon as we are done talking,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes. Then call anytime. Here is the calling bell.” The direct servant lingered around Collin until the very end, feeling uneasy, but when he received Irvan’s straight gaze, he flinched as if pierced by a spear and escaped into the hallway.</p>
<p>All the servants left the room. Collin clenched his teeth to prevent his jaw from trembling. <em>‘Let’s calm down, calm down.’</em> Collin cried out inwardly for composure. It is said that even if you are captured by the devil, you can survive if you have wit. The bigger the crisis, the more composed you have to be.</p>
<p>In broad daylight and with many eyes watching, Irvan couldn’t be casually violent. No one knows what happened in the dungeon. No, specifically, the people who knew had been turned into chunks of meat, and the dead can’t speak. No matter what Irvan had to say in the future, Collin would insist that it was a setup and a lie.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know what you’re going to talk about, but as you can see, I’m not feeling well, so I just want this conversation to end as soon as possible,” he said.</p>
<p>Even though Collin stated his request, Irvan didn’t care. “Did you enjoy your meal?” he said. Irvan wasn’t very talkative. In particular, he felt alien putting on this kind of show.</p>
<p>“…More or less,” Colling responded, finding Irvan’s response bizarre. He leaned back. “As you can see, I am not feeling well so I needed help,” he said. Collin glared at Irvan, as if telling him his displeasure. Irvan merely smiled at him mockingly.</p>
<p>“I heard you dragged Emma into the dungeon,” he said.</p>
<p>“Heard what? From whom?” Collin blinked quickly in shock. Was there a loose hole in the castle?</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know that. The very fact that I was told that is important.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t see it in person, did you? What you know is false. I didn’t drag Miss Herman to the dungeons, I brought her in for an investigation on an incident.”</p>
<p>“You dragged her not to a courtroom or an investigation room, but straight to the dungeon?” As Irvan narrowed his eyes, a cold chill ran down Collin’s neck. He felt as if he had been pierced by a spear. Collin was shivering from the chill that enveloped his whole body, but he pretended to be calm.</p>
<p>“That’s because enforcement should be fair! I was afraid that there might be preferential treatment if I had taken her there first!” Collin shouted desperately.</p>
<p>As Irvan looked at him quietly, the atmosphere became chillier. Colin’s complexion hardened and his nervousness became visible on his face.</p>
<p>“Don’t… don’t get me wrong,” Collin said, his mouth felt difficult to move. “Why are you misunderstanding? I am telling the truth as it is.”</p>
<p>Collin sensed something strange and disturbing would befall from Irvan’s unusually relaxed attitude. It was akin to a beast on the verge of hunting. He turned immediately to the door. <em>‘N-Nothing is going to happen, right?’</em> Just outside that door, his servants are close by, waiting in the hallway. He was certain that his quick-witted servant had called the knights and soldiers as well.</p>
<p><em>‘They will come in when I ring the bell,’ </em>he thought about the knights who sided with the Muns and felt a little relieved.<em> ‘……However.’ </em>Collin suddenly remembered that Monte had not done much for him since Irvan had returned from Grok. This was troublesome as he might be on the influence of drugs  and harm even that woman attached to him.<em> ‘But if she was unscathed, then the drug didn’t have an effect at all.’</em></p>
<p>The incident in Underground prison happened yesterday. This means that Irvan was determined to kill and was of conscious mind, not because of a drug-induced excitement or urge.</p>
<p><em>‘He is nothing but a human butcher!’ </em>Who in the world will slaughter nearly forty men without going mad? They were not just unfamiliar mercenaries, but people who he spent time eating, sleeping, and drinking together in one space.<em> ‘……it can be dangerous if I don’t behave properly.’ </em>Ultimately, he decided not to provoke him. He should be able to talk his way out of this.</p>
<p>“Do you have nothing more to say about that?” As Ivan hurriedly approached the bed, Collin became fraught with terror and leaned close to the head of the bed. His voice began to tremble as he explained, “I will explain what happened yesterday! So… leuk!” Before he could formulate a sentence, Irvan was already choking him.</p>
<p>“Kkkeuk!” Collin struggled and tried to shake the grip from his neck with both hands, but the hand that gripped his neck was like a thick chain that didn’t budge. The world turned red in an instant. His vision shook and blurred and  tears welled up. Collin desperately struggled, but the grip on his neck pressed harder and harder.</p>
