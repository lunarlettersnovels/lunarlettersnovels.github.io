            <p><strong>Chapter 32.2</strong></p>
<p>“Why was Irvan staying in that cabin?” she began with a question that gnawed at the back of her head. “I’m just curious since I heard he was there for about a month.”</p>
<p>“Uh…” Laute nervously coughed and looked around. “What I say from now must not be repeated carelessly, Miss Herman.”</p>
<p>Emma solemnly nodded. “Understood.”</p>
<p>After checking the surroundings one more time, Laute began to whisper lowly. From a young age, Irvan had shown excellent talent in many, but his emotions were said to be particularly unstable. He was pretty much emotionless, and that’s why he could be cruel without remorse.</p>
<p>Opinions were divided between the veterans’ association, advisory group, and the subordinates. They say his temperament was caused from being born on the night of a full moon and cursed by darkness; some claimed his behavior was due to aftereffects of his mother’s absence and father’s lack of affection during his upbringing; some expressed their opinions about how he had come in contact with cursed blood during a fight with a monster.</p>
<p>What was certain was that Irvan’s cruelty had steadily intensified the year after he’d become an adult. Everyone could only accept his brutal tendencies without disagreement for fear of their lives.</p>
<p>“Lately, Master Irvan has become quite worried about Count Limon’s health as he has started full-scale treatment. This time, Monte, the doctor, proposed quarantine treatment, so Irvan tried it,” Laute finally answered her queries.</p>
<p>It dawned on Emma now, Irvan wasn’t physically ill – the problem was his mental health.</p>
<p>As Emma listened to Laute’s story, she trembled without realizing it. She remembered Irvan slicing the werewolf; his appearance was that of a murderer who had an unquellable thirst for blood.</p>
<p>After that rattling confession, Laute faithfully accompanied Emma until the sun went down. From their tour, Emma became familiar with the geography and structure of the unusual, vast castle, and through their conversation, she was able to snwer most of the curiosities she had.</p>
<p>Finally reaching their destination, Laute nodded at Emma. “Then we shall meet again next time, Miss Herman.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Laute.”</p>
<p>After safely taking Emma to the annex, he left after giving assurances to call on him whenever she needed him or had any other questions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When it was close to dinnertime, the golden sun glowed into an orange sunset. Under the setting sun, the annex stood still.</p>
<p>Emma didn’t know this deserted place was naturally quiet. But it felt more like so because of the pond surrounding the building like a moat. The water was still, not the sound of flowing water or splashing could be heard.</p>
<p>She sat by the window and tilted her head, listening only to the sound of crickets. The sound made her feel peaceful, almost drowsy. Meanwhile, the sunlight reflected on the window grew thicker and stretched long. Soon, the world would be colored by the beautiful, warm colors and dark, mysterious dusk.</p>
<p>Whether the cabin or the annex, it still felt like an unfamiliar place. But in a sense, Emma was comforted because it belonged to Irvan. As such, she felt somewhat cozy, so in the middle of the silence, her tired eyelids closed.</p>
<p><em>‘Irvan will probably return soon,’</em> she thought drowsily.</p>
<p>As she was soaked in the quiet. afternoon sun, she suddenly realized a sense of belonging with Irvan, and a bitter smile crept to her face.  Up until just a while ago, Irvan had been a stranger to her dangerous place, but now he had become an inseparable center point in Emma’s life.</p>
<p>That stormy night where fate brought them together; the night had changed everything.</p>
<p>Now she could not go back to the time before she had known him. Like rowing into an unknown intersection in the river, her world before and after meeting him had completely changed.</p>
<p><em>‘Will I still be able to leave like this?’</em></p>
<p>Emma remained unchanged on the surface. She was still Emerlin Herman and an heiress, the certificate and the key to the vault left as a legacy were also still hers. Reshire and Polarville were more than four days away by carriage.</p>
<p>However, there was no way for her to leave this place alone without Irvan’s permission, as Van Wert Castle was tightly secured.</p>
<p><em>‘I can’t stay in Van Wert Castle if I am not a guest anyway,’</em> she reasoned.</p>
<p>The sole entryway to leave the castle was the main gate. Whether it was the main gate or the side gate, she must pass through the heavily guarded fortress to be able to leave. Van Wert Castle was a solid place surrounded by a four-story tall fortress wall. And she couldn’t ask anyone other than Irvan for help.</p>
<p>She was clearly a stranger, and she didn’t know or trust anyone here except Baron Berne and Laute, who had been introduced by Irvan today. These two were the only people she knew who were closest to Irvan. Whatever she did here or planned, there was no way for her to dodge the eyes and ears fixed on Irvan.</p>
<p><em>‘…I’ll take my time thinking about my departure.’</em></p>
<p>There was no rush. Emma was a stranger who had to leave in the future.</p>
<p>Of course, there were quite a few of her uncles in Polarville eagerly waiting for her arrival, but they would not worry much even if she was a week late. The travel spanned a long distance and her schedule was often delayed due to various events that had occurred on her journey.</p>
