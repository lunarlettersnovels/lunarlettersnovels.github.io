            <p><strong>Chapter 75.1</strong></p>
<p>There was no problem with the number of guests for the wedding, as the bride’s guests were all from Baron Berne’s side. However, Emma personally invited her uncle and friends. It was surprising that the first thing they heard from her in a long time was an invitation to her wedding, but they would understand since they had been childhood friends and had even attended her father’s funeral.</p>
<p>Emma’s uncle and friends must have thought that she had gone missing on her way to Polarville. From that point on, her uncle must have been doing everything he could to find her… There was also Otto and Dora, and Emma felt uneasy about not contacting them as several months passed. She wondered if they would be happy if she contacted them and told them that she was safe.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in mind, she sent her invitation by hand. Soon, a week passed and replies began to arrive one after another. Although the territorial battle had not yet ended, the specific date of the wedding would be announced later, but they all said they would attend regardless.</p>
<p>Emma was delighted and excited at the thought of her long-awaited wedding and seeing her friends again. And just in time, news of a long-awaited victory arrived. As the fierce battle continued, the victory of the territorial battle was decided by Irvan’s unmatched performance when he secretly infiltrated the enemy camp and beheaded their leader.</p>
<p>Baron Muns, who had lost his commander unexpectedly, surrendered and the Muland region, which had lost its lord, was subjugated to Count Van Wert. As a result, after absorbing both Reshire and Muland, Count Van Wert had a force equal to Count Edner, but it was not necessarily a big advantage or an overwhelming victory. This was because the supervisor sent from the royal palace demanded half of Muland under the direct control of the king in exchange for a declaration of victory.</p>
<p>Irvan gave up the territorial battle with several major conditions, which was approved by the royal court to benefit either side, and the conflict finally ended.</p>
<p>When the news of the victory was announced, Emma received a short note that said, “I miss you, what about our wedding?”</p>
<p>Her heart thumped sweetly as she read the message.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As Irvan had declared, a grand wedding was held at Count Van Wert’s castle after the victory in the territorial battle. Despite the long and dark funeral of Count Limon, the castle was filled with bright ribbons and colorful, fragrant flowers. Guests arrived one after another, creating a blessed atmosphere for the wedding. Two days before the event, Emma greeted the guests and showed off the elegance of a skilled lady.</p>
<p>After a season had passed, Emma had spent a long and meaningful period in Reshire. She had grown accustomed to Irvan and the unfamiliar Van Wert castle, and before she knew it, she felt that each day was becoming a part of her daily life.</p>
<p>As Emma represented Irvan at the Van Wert Castle, she was in charge of managing Reshire with the help of the vassals and the support of the bureaucrats. Under her leadership, the estate regained stability and flourished. She thought of the Van Wert Castle as a large apothecary, as Irvan had said before, so it was not difficult for her to run it. In addition to handling the various affairs of the land, Emma also explored her interests in scents and medicine.</p>
<p>Emma invited new personnel to the empty alchemy laboratories and pharmacies and directed various attempts to incorporate the local characteristics of Reshire. One of these efforts was the sponsorship of a greenhouse in the Ferragen Mountains to grow special crops, inspired by Reina’s vegetable garden in the past.</p>
<p>After several attempts, Emma was able to successfully grow her favorite plant, luphenyl, although she would have to wait a few more years for the harvest. The project to process medicine produced from the greenhouse into raw materials for alchemy and herbal medicine was successful from the start, and rumors about it spread, drawing attention and expectation from related industries and academia.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Emma set up a public health center at the entrance to the castle gate, prepared basic drugs and medicine for the health of the residents, and distributed them free of charge. Common illnesses such as colds, fevers, and indigestion were easily treated with Herman’s special medicine, while underlying diseases were treated with relief medicine.</p>
<p>Emma also provided hygiene education, encouraging people to make it a daily habit to wash their hands with the free sanitizer and disinfect their homes with alcohol. As special crops and raw materials gradually became available, they were in high demand and brought in substantial profits, which were used to set up a relief center to provide free meals. As a result of these efforts, minor illnesses in Reshire were significantly reduced, and the nutritional status and quality of life improved.</p>
<p>Emma’s popularity grew day by day as she was praised by those who had suffered from illness and poverty. No one thought of Countess Karina anymore, and Irvan’s popularity also grew due to his association with Emma.</p>
<p>One day, after being notified by a maid that Mr. Herman from Polarville had arrived, Emma grabbed a lavish dress and headed for the front door for the first time in a month.</p>
<p>“Uncle!”</p>
<p>“Emma!”</p>
<p>Uncle Philip had changed beyond recognition after almost half a year, appearing rough with clear signs of hardship. His eyes were deeply sunken and his under-eye area was dark.</p>
<p>“How long has it been?” Uncle Phillip’s face was gaunt, with deep wrinkles etched into his skin. His cheekbones stood out prominently, as if he had weathered many storms over the years. His body looked thin and emaciated.</p>
<p>Tears welled up in Uncle Phillip’s eyes as he took Emma’s hand in his own. His fingers were dry and gnarled, like old twigs, as they tightly gripped Emma’s fine, pale hands.</p>
