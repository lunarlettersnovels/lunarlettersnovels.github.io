            <p><strong>Chapter 66.1</strong></p>
<p>The title usually follows the bloodline. If the sick Count Limon passes away, the next count should be Irvan, the leader of the Black Fang Knights. When that happens, the merciless Irvan would be in charge of the estate. Irvan’s rule as Commander was so terrifying that people were horrified with the thought that he would become the next feudal lord. It wasn’t hard to imagine how much blood would be shed.</p>
<p>Most people regarded the current situation to be a contrast. The benevolent Countess Karina in power and overlooking the assembly, while the wicked Irvan sat arrogantly.</p>
<p>But those who supported Irvan were loyally stubborn. No matter how much Countess Karina showed her value with merciful ruling and great politics, they would only follow Irvan. On the other hand, those who were mesmerized by Karina weren’t too fond of Irvan.</p>
<p>Those who were neutral couldn’t decide between the two. If Irvan was pronounced to be guilty of murder, then the successor of the Van Wert castle’s owner would be uncertain.</p>
<p>It was hard to tell how long Count Limon would live; Irvan would become powerless. He should be succeeding Count Limon after his death, but if he is found to be guilty then he may be dragged to the capital for the murder of a noble and locked up in the palace jail forever.</p>
<p>Then who would become the next count? Countess Karina also didn’t have a child, she didn’t have a justification to keep the power.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah….!’</em></p>
<p>Those who were thinking for their own benefit zeroed on the words that Countess Karina said to Irvan: A marriage with Emerlyn Herman! It wasn’t something she said out of the blue. It was probably a set up for the future.</p>
<p>Emma Herman seemed like a promiscuous woman with a healthy disposition. If they married, there was a high chance of having a child. She also didn’t have anyone supporting her, so even if Irvan was found to be guilty, there was no chance she would break up the marriage. As Irvan was imprisoned, he wouldn’t be able to succeed the title, and it would naturally go to the child between them.</p>
<p>But Emma, who was a commoner, wouldn’t have the ability nor, like Karina, have the justification to rule Reshire. But as the wise Duchess Karina ruled behind Emma’s child, then the estate would be peaceful for generations to come.</p>
<p>The neutralists quickly finished calculating all of this in their head and glared at the traditionalists. Baron Berne was watching the trial calmly, but it was only a matter of time that the traditionalists were about to collapse.</p>
<p>The judge’s gavel hit. “The vice commander Roham needs to clearly state the evidence of his claim. Or I’ll consider it as deceiving the court.”</p>
<p>“You can’t see the trees if you look at the forest as a whole,” Roham started talking cautiously as everyone stared. “Did you really believe there was no other person?”</p>
<p>As his statement rang through the court, the Countess, who was secretly smug, looked up and glared at Roham.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” The prosecutor shouted.</p>
<p>“It’s like I said. Your assumption is incorrect,” Roham replied.</p>
<p>“Incorrect? Not at all!”</p>
<p>The prosecutor quickly flipped the document and examined it thoroughly.<em> ‘A third party existed in Coliner’s bedroom?’ </em>Unbelievable. He flipped the pages furiously. As he utilized the estate’s secretaries to investigate the incident, even the smallest details were on it. The report was as thick as a book. He checked the report again but Roham’s claim was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>The prosecutor declared after examining the report quickly: “Vice commander Roham! Stop just making claims, but show us the evidence.”</p>
<p>“Evidence? Of course I have it. I’ll bring a witness in. Honorable judge, please allow the witness that will prove my claim.”</p>
<p>The judge blinked in confusion but as everyone stared at him, he nodded reluctantly. “I’ll allow it.”</p>
<p>Roham signaled and the knights moved quickly. As the door to the court opened, two people showed up. They were wearing thick robes with a hood, but judging by their thin figure and light steps, they seemed to be women.</p>
<p>Countess Karina’s face turned pale as she recognized the ladies. She shivered in rage.</p>
<p>“Please tell us who you are.”</p>
