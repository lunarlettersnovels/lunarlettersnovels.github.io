            <p><strong>Chapter 18.1</strong></p>
<p>Emma, trapped in that man’s gaze, shook her head. “Last night… when I took my clothes off…”</p>
<p>“Hmm, you were mistaken.”</p>
<p>“Clearly that happened. When a man and woman remove their clothes and…”</p>
<p>“All right. It’s partly true. You did remove your clothes and jump on me.”</p>
<p>“B-but…”</p>
<p>“As a result, we have come to this. Have we not?” He started at her. She felt embarrassed caught in his glare and couldn’t think of anything to say.</p>
<p>“It was a matter of time anyway. Don’t tell me you hate me now.”</p>
<p>Emma didn’t respond.</p>
<p>“Emma, do you hate me?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Emma slowly.  She lay there with a baffled face, gasping for breath. The man closed his blur-gray eyes for a second and opened them again.</p>
<p>“There is no way you can hate me. And I’m so perfectly right most of the time that it’s almost scary.”</p>
<p>He looked deeply into Emma’s eyes, as if he were intoxicated by her. His eyes closed again. His eyelashes made delicate lines across his face. He opened them again. “Relax, no. There we go.”</p>
<p>Emma, who was getting stiff, obediently followed the man’s words. There was no other choice. Their bodies pressed together didn’t leave much room for movements.</p>
<p>While the man remained still, Emma held his strong arms and tried to relax her torso to control the thing she could feel in her body. Meanwhile, he was embedded so deep in her. She half wanted to clamp her legs shut.</p>
<p>“Open up, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Ah…</p>
<p>Emma let out a long breath and accepted the hot flesh that she felt between her legs. His think member wriggled inside her seeking permission to go in deep. He began to move slowly.</p>
<p>“Ahh…”</p>
<p>She felt hyper alert. She felt the pulsing member inside her and was confused whether it was going to push further inside or slide out.</p>
<p>“That’s it. Good job,” said the man gently. She caressed Emma’s slender shoulder softly as though she was fragile to his touch. The man slowly set himself into position.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Oh…”</p>
<p>An unfamiliar heat rose within Emma and her inner walls as she accepted the man while matching his movement. Many of her friends had said it hurt terribly the first time, but Emma wasn’t prepared for the type of pain they meant. It felt like she was being torn apart from the inside. She couldn’t even utter a word.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the kind of pain that hurt once and subsided. It kept hurting and throbbing for a long while. Her friends had glowed strangely in joy as though they knew of a secret that she didn’t. <em>Was the pain really worth it? </em>Emma thought.</p>
<p>Everyone had shared a subtle smile as though they were in on a joke that Emma didn’t know about. They had urged Emma to experience it once to know what they were talking about.</p>
<p>“You’re doing a good job, Emma.”</p>
<p>“Ohh…”</p>
<p>When she got used to the pain, she was aware of his body pressed against hers. She was also aware of his member filling her inner walls.</p>
<p>“Mmmm…”</p>
<p>Emma let out a faint moan. The man hugged her with his strong arms. Meanwhile, he thrust his waist. Emma flinched at his hard member drilling into her.</p>
<p>“Ease your tension. Relax.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Emma held onto him as she exhaled the breath she had been holding in. Holding the man’s arms and his shoulders. She endured the pain. With the overwhelming pain, some numbness grew inside her. <em>Was this how it was supposed to feel? </em>His large, thick member slowly thrust deep and slid out. His thrusts overwhelmed Emma.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…” The man groaned, letting out his breath as though he had held it inside him for very long. “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Emma nodded. He carefully continued thrusting his waist as if he was relieved.</p>
<p>“Ah… oh!” Emma arched her back and wrapped her arms over his muscular shoulders. As she hugged him tightly, his body odor filled her nostrils like a subtle scent. She felt a strange comfort and stability in her heart being close to him. Matching her movements with the man’s, Emma closed her eyes.</p>
