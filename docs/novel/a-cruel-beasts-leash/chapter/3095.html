            <p><strong>Chapter 41.1</strong></p>
<p>Irvan’s enlarged member delved inside her wet, inner walls, his pelvis sturdily pressed down against her folds. Emma could feel herself drown in pleasure. While his hot rod was deeply inside, stimulating her womanhood, Emma gasped and dug her nails into his arm as she rode her climax.  The pleasure that wrapped around her entire body almost felt like it was bursting to escape; the hands that grasped him turned pale.</p>
<p>“Oh, ah, ah… Yes!” Emma m*aned, unable to retrain herself any longer.</p>
<p>“Hush. They’ll hear you if you keep m*aning like that. Who knows, someone may even be leaning on the door now.”</p>
<p>At his mischievous whisper, she hurriedly swallowed her voice. With barely parted lips, her sweet breath exhaled, her vision blurred.</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>The tip of his p*nis, hot as a fireball and with veins pulsing on each side, widened her narrow path. Irvan thrusted without pause into her passage, digging deeper and deeper. At his rigorous actions, Emma could only feel dizziness descend. Whenever his long, thick member with its hard tip touched her core, hot nectar overflowed from the point of contact.</p>
<p>Irvan kissed her neck, murmuring, “You’re boiling inside.”</p>
<p>“Ahhhh… Oh!”</p>
<p>When the rhythm became fiercer, their entangled nether regions spilled warm and creamy liquids.</p>
<p>“You must be hungry,” Irvan whispered. “Seeing that <em>it’s</em> drooling and swallowing me so well.”</p>
<p>Emma, with eyes tightly closed, squirmed underneath him, twisting her waist whenever she felt his hot rod slip through her narrow passage and penetrate deeper into her slippery walls. The heavy sense of mass pounded her until even her navel tingled.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…”</p>
<p>“I have to feed it more,” he said.</p>
<p>Irvan thrust himself deeper and deeper as if enticed with Emma’s seductive voice. The member which dug into Emma’s trembling body came in and out er*tically, loudly parting her wet, red folds.</p>
<p>“Now that you’re nice and hot, I’m going to fill you up to meet your expectations,” he murmured, placing strength on his solid thigh muscles to thrust himself more strongly inside Emma. The sounds of pounding flesh echoed in the air.</p>
<p>“Oh! Ahh!” Emma tossed her head back, eventually letting out a m*an. It was inevitable even though she tried to hold it back. Then, his p*nis soaked with her creamy juice, smoothly slid out of her warm gap, coming out with a plop.</p>
<p>“Whew.” Irvan breathed heavily, stretching his sweaty torso. His muscles weaved beautifully around his toned body; he was like an artwork. Emma’s barely opened lids were only filled with the sight of him.</p>
<p>“I’d like to relax and enjoy this scene…” he suddenly said, “but it’s still dripping and tight for me.”</p>
<p>Irvan loomed over her like a god of desire. Beneath his well-defined torso, his thick member stood erect in front of her, covered in wetness, glistening.</p>
<p>“Can I still handle this?” Irvan whispered to Emma.</p>
<p>“Huh? Can I?” Emma mumbled confusedly in reply.</p>
<p>As his hardened tip exposed to the cold air positioned itself on the entrance of her waiting hole, Emma’s eyes fluttered close.</p>
<p>Irvan exhaled deeply. “I feel like I’m going mad. I want to thrust inside you until you break.”</p>
<p>His heart pounded in excitement, and Emma’s folds similarly trembled in anticipation for him. He raised Emma’s slender ankles, rested them on his shoulders, moved his waist forward and deeply thrusted his member at an angle.</p>
<p>“Ahhh…!”</p>
<p>For a moment, Emma’s waist lifted high under the pressure and then lowered as Irvan’s p*nis squeezed through her narrow gap, imbedding itself into her deepest core.</p>
<p>“Yes… ah!”</p>
<p>Irvan groaned. “Oh…”</p>
<p>At this position, Emma could feel anew his thickness and a deeper depth. A thrilling sensation spread from Emma’s center as her trembling pink flesh devoured his tight member, soaking it with milky cream. Irvan tilted his chin and pressed his thumb on her cl*t*ris. Emma buckled beneath him, m*aning.  He licked Emma’s ankle resting on his shoulder, moved his waist, digging deeper. The tip of her toes curled as his tongue licked her flesh. Excited, her insides clamped around his exploring member.</p>
<p>“Emma, loosen up,” Irvan ordered with a groan.</p>
<p>He thrusted deep, shallow, and explored different angles. Emma’s body bent and trembled with his dizzying ministrations. When his hot member finally hit an extremely pleasurable spot, her inside clamped even harder, spreading a sense of pleasure throughout her body.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, oh!” Emma cried. Her body trembled, wet with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Irvan murmured, continually stroking her sensitive nib. “That’s a good girl.”</p>
<p>Perhaps because Irvan had grabbed her legs and placed them over his shoulders, the insertion felt even deeper than normal. WIth each thrust, it brought forth crazy pleasure that felt as if it would split her body open. Her heated inner walls that rubbed against his thick pillar constantly spilled hot, sticky liquid, soaking their joint regions. The sensation felt too much, and Emma wept.</p>
