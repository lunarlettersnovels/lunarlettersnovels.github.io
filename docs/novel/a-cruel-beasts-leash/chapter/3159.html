            <p><b>Chapter 7.2</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That seems quite plausible,”  The man responded flatly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma suddenly became anxious. She felt her hands and feet grow cold as if she was experiencing motion sickness. “Are you going to hand me over to them?” she whispered fearfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know yet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does he mean by “yet”? That means you are also thinking of handing me over to them!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma urgently said, “If you save me, I’ll reward you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the word reward was too ambiguous, the man didn’t seem to be tempted.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should I do to make him interested? Should I mention the specific amount of reward I would be giving him?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the man didn’t seem to be interested in money. Emma was not sure how much money she should offer to melt the cold-blooded man’s heart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could feel agony in her heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the wealth in her hands was made up of her father’s blood and sweat. Handing over everything that her father owned was basically handing over her father to a stranger. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t use my father’s property in vain.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  Emma, who thought that far, hurriedly changed her mind. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘No! I must not think of it as a waste.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma clenched her fist nervously. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘It’s the price of my life. It’s also my father’s legacy, but the moment I die, it also becomes my legacy. How much is the price of my life? Everything? Or…’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Her mind was dizzy with confused thoughts. The more confused her mind was, the more her hands and feet trembled as if she was a small mouse cornered by a big cat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you going to give me?” The man, who was watching her steem in turmoil, broke the silence and asked first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Emma suddenly lost her energy due to the man’s uninterested cold voice. It even felt pointless to think about life and death in a situation like this. “Half… If you save me, I’ll give you half of my father’s legacy…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the maximum Emma could come up with. To be honest, she was willing to give all the legacy but deep down she knew she couldn’t say it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I were lucky to survive today, I still have to prepare for my life after that.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tough world, a young lady being driven into the street without any money would normally result in death.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polarville’s uncle Phillip would also not be happy if Emma only showed up alive. Phillip was a family member but between him and Emma’s family, there was little to no interaction. If Emma was placed like a piece of luggage no one wants, she would definitely not be able to survive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please…Please. Please help me. Don’t hand me over to them.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If my reward is going to be money, I am pretty disappointed. Money is utterly useless here,” the man refuted coldly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But the man was young. It was possible to think that he would leave this place and venture out into the world. ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wouldn’t he spend some money in the village?</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">But his clothes seem pretty luxurious to me…</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, I mean I guess he could be spending just the right amount he earns as a cabin keeper. This cabin is meant for royals… so he might have enough salary to live quite pleasantly.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about your family? Won’t your family need some money?” she began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I don’t think there are many people who I can call my family,” the man murmured, sweeping his chin with his long fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed the man was also an orphan. Just like Emma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your wife, or even your girlfriend…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm.” The man didn’t answer but just responded in a thoughtful way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for some reason, Emma felt a corner of her heart lighten when she saw the man’s face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma drooped her eyes and opened her mouth quietly. “Then, I’ll do something else! What do you need? I’ll do anything,” she resolutely said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since he said he didn’t need money, Emma had to put a different condition for the deal to be established.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His eyes glinted. “Anything?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a life-or-death deal. Emma felt she would do anything to live at a fair price.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man’s gaze sharply narrowed down at her, his whole being exuding an atmosphere of annoyance as he weighed her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even so, I don’t really need or want anything.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man’s indifferent attitude gradually made Emma’s heart shrink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am an uninvited guest, after all.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was quite natural to act irritated if someone came in the middle of the night, disturbing one’s sleep and making a big fuss. It would especially be more irritating as an employer who works in a quiet cabin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as it became more difficult to make a deal, Emma finally pleaded sorrowfully knowing it was her last chance. “Please! Save me!” I’ll really do anything!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her voice almost turned into a sob. “If they catch me, I’m dead. He said he would kill me after harassing me in the carriage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man’s dull face instantly changed as soon as he heard her say ‘kill’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a strange look in his icy blue-gray eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did he say he would kill you?”</span></p>
