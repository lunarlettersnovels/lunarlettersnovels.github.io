            <p><strong>Chapter 66.2</strong></p>
<p>The women took off their hood as the court scribe commented. A few quick-witted people were able to guess who the ladies were the moment they walked in and as they expected, they were Countess Karina’s maids.</p>
<p>“We are Heather and Les. We work as a maid for the Countess in the castle.”</p>
<p>Two of them looked nervous as they introduced themselves. They couldn’t even look up, it was as if they were the criminals. They especially couldn’t even dare to glance at Countess Karina.</p>
<p>“Do you swear to the Lord that you will only tell the truth and nothing but the truth in court?”</p>
<p>“We swear. I swear to the Lord that there will not be any lie in our statement.”</p>
<p>As the maids finished their oath, they held each other’s hands and waited for the question. Roham went towards the witnesses first.</p>
<p>“I’ll check something light first. I know you two well, but other people might not. How long have you been working as the Countess’s maid?” he started.</p>
<p>“It’s been 7 years.” Heather, the black haired maid, answered.</p>
<p>“Where are you from? Muland? Or Reshire?”</p>
<p>“Reshire. Wert City to be precise.”</p>
<p>“So you’re from our estate?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“From what I know, Countess Karina had three maids. Where is the third maid from?”</p>
<p>“Muland.”</p>
<p>“By Muland, you mean Baron Mun’s estate.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Terin is our senior.”</p>
<p>“Mmh… then who is the one that usually carries out Countess Karina’s orders?”</p>
<p>“It’s Terin.”</p>
<p>Roham pointed at the red-headed lady that was quietly standing behind Countess Karina.</p>
<p>“Is she Terin?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“All right, as everyone heard, Terin is Countess Karina’s maid from Muland. She was part of Mun’s family and came over. These two are from our estate. They were the maids personally chosen by Countess Karina after marrying Count Limon.”</p>
<p>People examined the maids curiously after Roham’s explanation. They were wondering why he put them as witnesses. Roham slightly smiled. Then he looked at the maids.</p>
<p>“Do you know Chairman Collin?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. He is the Countess’s brother,” they answered.</p>
<p>“Did you see him often?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“How often? More than twice a day?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Roham nodded satisfyingly and rubbed his hand lightly. “Good. Then let’s get to the point. Three days ago, Chairman Collin died. Did you see him that day as well?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“When?”</p>
<p>“In the morning.”</p>
<p>“Really? Did you see him with the Countess, or without her?”</p>
<p>Heather hesitated for a moment and answered. “Without her.”</p>
<p>“All three of you?”</p>
<p>“No. Just me and Les.”</p>
<p>Roham looked at Les, the blonde maid. Les looked down and avoided his eyes. “Why did you meet him?” he asked.</p>
<p>“We served him breakfast.”</p>
<p>“Both of you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“To serve the Chairman as the Countess’s maid. How odd. Did you do that often?”</p>
<p>“…. From time to time.”</p>
<p>“So to put it together, you met the Chairman at least once a day and even served him meals <em>from</em> <em>time to time</em>.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Roham spoke looking relaxed.</p>
<p>“They said they were serving breakfast three days ago, but the prosecutor doesn’t know about this. Do you have a witness or evidence to prove this?”</p>
<p>“We personally took the breakfast from the kitchen that day. It was soup for digestion. Everyone in the kitchen knows. The maid that was cleaning the stairs also saw us. Also all the servants and guards that serve Chair Collin know.”</p>
<p>As Heather finished, Roham lifted his hand.</p>
<p>“Honorable judge, please check whether the witnesses are telling the truth.”</p>
<p>The judge immediately ordered the court scribe to check the attendees and the kitchen staff. After some time passed, the scribe that left the court came back and said it was all true.</p>
<p>“Prosecutor, you see? When Irvan arrived to have a discussion with Chairman Collin, the maids were also there. The two of you were serving breakfast at that time, correct?”</p>
<p>As Roham looked at Heather, she nodded.</p>
<p>The prosecutor stood up and exclaimed. “Objection!”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Vice captain Roham is wasting time and clouding the issue. The fact that a third party was there means nothing as evidence! Are you saying that they strangled Chairman Collin instead?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” As Roham calmly answered, the prosecutor opened his mouth and blinked blankly at him.</p>
