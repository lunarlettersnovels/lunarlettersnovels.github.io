        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 74.2</strong></p>
<p>This was a method of exploiting the blind spots in the list of nobles managed by royal secretary. As Irvan intended, in order for Emma to become a countess, it was very important for her to be registered in the Berne family before making the list of nobility.</p>
<p>According to the kingdom law, the king’s approval was required for a marriage of a count or someone of higher ranking. If there were no political problems, the palace did not look closely at the internal situation and only confirmed brief facts about the name of the families.</p>
<p>The Bernes were widely known as the vassals of Countess Van Wert for generations, as well as managing the property of Irvan’s biological mother, Lady Charlene. It wasn’t uncommon to marry a vassal family with such a close relationship, and Baron of Berne wasn’t just a noble, but also a landlord.</p>
<p>If the royal family asked for a list of families to be submitted for confirmation, Emma only needed to submit the Berne’s family register. The king wouldn’t know the details of the Berne family, so there wouldn’t be any big issues.</p>
<p>“Now, Lady Emerlyn,” Baroness Berne called, a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Please call me Emma!” Emma hurriedly replied.</p>
<p>“Alright. Lady Emma.”</p>
<p>The baroness, still with a smile on her face, clapped her hands.</p>
<p>“Now, my family will take over the marriage ceremony and prepare for the wedding. I will take responsibility to make Lady Emma the most beautiful and happiest bride in the world.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Just like that, Emma became a member of the Berne family and began preparing for her wedding. While Irvan was busy preparing for the estate battle, Emma was invited to the Berne family and faced her two new brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews.</p>
<p>She smiled awkwardly when she met them. They weren’t unfamiliar faces. The last time she met Baroness Berne, it was when she was ill. But now, she met her as a family member.</p>
<p>She was unfamiliar with everyone, and the overall atmosphere was awkward, but Lady Evelyn, who often referred to Emma as her aunt and treated her kindly, made it possible for her to conclude her meeting without much discomfort.</p>
<p>The next day, Irvan led the Knights of the Black Fang, clad in gleaming metal armour. With his countless troops gathered, Irvan, declared the beginning of the battle for the territory with an imposing ceremony.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Even if she was left alone in the Countess’s castle, Emma was busy every day.</p>
<p>Ever since she appeared in front of the audience room, people had been focusing their attention on her. And perhaps because it was difficult to deal with Irvan directly, at some point, she found herself acting as an intermediary between Irvan and the bureaucrats.</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>Irvan, with a handsome frown on his face, didn’t examine the documents in detail or listen to what was going on, but delegated the tasks to Emma for her to discuss with the bureaucrats and resolve them on her own. So ever since Irvan’s absence, all kinds of requests, petitions, appeals, appeasements and demands had naturally flocked to Emma.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, Emma took charge of official duties of the estate and her wedding preparations, but she didn’t get a chance to talk about it, let alone complain to Irvan as he was in battle for territory. Even if there was an issue that was difficult for her to resolve on her own, she couldn’t say anything, fearing that it would interfere with Irvan on the battlefield.</p>
<p><em>It’s not a matter of life and death,’ </em>she reasoned. Therefore, Emma decided to refer to the opinions of Irvan’s trusted advisers, Baron Berne and Laute, after much struggle.</p>
<p>While the news of the national victories was heard one after another, Emma was busy taking care of the manor day by day. Even so, she prayed for Irvan’s safety, all the while her heart stayed in trepidation.</p>
<p>“Are you going to church again today?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I just need stability.”</p>
<p>She often went to church to soothe her anxious mind, and soon became acquainted with Bishop Albert. Bishop Albert was a fairly secular priest, and while he never encouraged her faith, his unique atmosphere of solemnity and benevolence gave her a strange sense of security.</p>
<p>“Making a donation to Bishop Albert will help you in many ways.”</p>
<p>Later, when she allocated a large portion of the donations to the church at the advice of Baroness Berne, Bishop Albert behaved kindly and gently towards her. Thanks to the support of Baroness Berne and the influence of Bishop Albert, Emma was viewed favourably. Through that, she gradually expanded her territory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Irvan’s absence passed as quickly as an arrow released from a bow.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Miss.”</p>
<p>Jenna, who had been promoted to chief maid of the Countess of Van Wert, approached Emma, and asked her while she was making a list to send out wedding invitations.</p>
<p>“I will finally confirm the names. Is there a total of four guests, including Phillip Herman, Becca Rayleigh, Sally Brooke, and Michelle Woodbin?” Jenna asked.</p>
<p>Emma paused. “Yes…” she replied, after some time.</p>
<p>“Now I will check the regions. Phillip is in Polarville, and the rest of them are in Summerville, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“Then can I send out the invitations like this?”</p>
<p>Looking at the carefully written words and neat handwriting on the invitation that Jenna had handed out, Emma smiled brightly. “That’s perfect. Thank you,” she said.</p>
