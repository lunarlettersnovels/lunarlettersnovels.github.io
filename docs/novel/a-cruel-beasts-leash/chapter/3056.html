            <p><b>Chapter 60.2</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countess Karina, who had spoken up to that point, glared at Baron Berne, who was sitting in the center of the conference room like an old, shrunk tree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, the perpetrator will have sole responsibility. It will have to be paid from the Knight Commander’s private property. Don’t you agree?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baron Berne nodded slowly. “…Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. Secretary, please discuss the details with Baron Berne and make it public.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countess Karina exchanged glances with the elders, a light smirk on her face. It is regrettable that the troops carefully prepared for the future were sacrificed in one single night, but this was only a step backward for a ten-step leap. If she could rob Irvan with this opportunity, she would be able to do something bigger, nonetheless, even using his own money for her strength to inflict a fatal blow on him. It was perfect.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘In the end, we just need to isolate Irvan,’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karin thought insidiously. That matter was easy. Irvan only has to be locked up with that naughty b!tch, day and knight, and have them reproduce like rabbits. Since Irvan is isolated, in the event that the girl produces an heir, it will naturally be concluded as Irvan’s child. She needed to contain Irvan now and ultimately defeat him in the future when Collin recovers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please take care of us in the future, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she walked out of the conference room with a smile that promised a generous reward to the elders, the butler approached Karina and reported that her younger brother had woken up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karin frowned. “His condition?” she asked, worried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is said to be normal. Fortunately, the antidote seems to be working. There are some aftereffects left, but it’s the normal aftermath of a paralyzing poison. He will be able to shake it off and get up in three or four days,” Baron Berne explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karina sighed. “I feel like I’ve lost ten years.” Karina finally felt relieved. She held her trembling hands and controlled her heart. No words could explain how heartbroken she was when she thought something was going to happen to her alter ego, her other half, Collin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more she thought about it, the more disgusted and furious she felt. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Wait and see… I’ll pay you back for this humiliation!’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Karina approached a window in the hallway, gritting her teeth as she looked at the annex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* * *</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a dark, bloody night passed, the dawn finally came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he arrived at the annex and put her on the bed, Emma collapsed as if she had fainted and fell into a deep sleep. Irvan, who was watching her quietly and guarding her bed, washed up and headed to the main building when morning came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Irvan appeared, the servants and attendants became pale-faced; they were frightened and eager to hide, perhaps because of the news of what had happened in the dungeon. Irvan went straight to the living room without any interference and stopped by the master room to visit his father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The doctor, Monte, had always kept him from approaching his father’s bed, with the reason that they should put the patient’s safety first. Irvan had to always stand at the entrance to the bedroom and look at Count Limon, who was always in bed with his eyes closed like the dead. But because of what happened last night, Monte was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t come in, young master.” The servants in charge of the Count saw Irvan and tried to stop him, but when Irvan strode closer with a solemn face  and unspeaking, they flinched back from the bed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he looked closely, Count Limon was nothing but skin and bones. The wrinkled skin had dried up and darkened, as though it had not seen sunlight for many years. The room smelled pungent, and the terrible, nauseating smell of medicine filled the air. Undeterred, Irvan looked down at his father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father, can you hear me?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how many times Irvan softly called, there was no answer. Count Limon was so immobile that it was unclear whether he was even alive unless one looked carefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Father…” Irvan’s eyes darkened, his orbs filled with mixed feelings. He grabbed Count Limon’s hand. His cold hands were heavy and wet like a corpse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The count is in critical condition all the time. We have to give him medicine as soon as possible,” the scared servant said, asking Irvan to leave the place because he had to start his morning treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m his child, what’s the matter? Can’t you do it while I’m here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-That’s…” The servant looked down at the floor with a dark complexion and murmured. “… Count Limon wouldn’t want to show his sick body to his child. As Monte has mentioned several times, he is in critical condition. I hope you will refrain from doing anything that disturbs the Count.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm… I see.” Count Limon originally had a meticulous personality. He liked neatness, to the point he had a little bit of mysophobia. After listening to the servant’s words, Irvan quietly agreed, as there was no specific reason to refute it. The servant quickly held her breath as Irvan passed by her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvan left the room, turned the corner and headed to Collin’s place. Collin was lying on his bed, eating. Countess Karina’s maids were taking care of him.      </span></p>
