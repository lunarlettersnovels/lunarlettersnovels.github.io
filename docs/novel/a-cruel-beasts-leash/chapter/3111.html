        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 33.1</strong></p>
<p>If the news of her wasn’t delivered immediately, her uncle would have thought her journey was delayed. So she still had some time to spare. But if there was no contact from her for longer than necessary, her uncle would start asking around.</p>
<p>And if her Uncle Phillip was lucky enough to find her whereabouts, she would be able to leave Van Wert Castle.</p>
<p><em>‘It would be better to leave with my uncle in the future…’</em></p>
<p>From being Irvan’s ‘guest’, Emma knew very well how her situation would unfold.</p>
<p>More than ten people had witnessed the couple’s secret relationship at the cabin a few days ago. And all the women there were also the countess’ maids. As the countess is a significant figure inside the Van Wert Castle, the status of her maids could not be ignored. Surely there were still rumors about her up and about.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s better to let the situation take its course, rather than exacerbate it.’</em></p>
<p>Emma calmly measured the way she had conducted herself. If she endured as long as possible, Irvan may come forward and provide a means of transportation even later. Even if he stubbornly clung to Emma now, it was a relationship that had a solemn ending.</p>
<p>No matter how notorious Irvan was for his brutal nature, it was clear that he was the only successor to Count Van Wert. His status itself was different from Emma, a mere commoner. And as long as Emma was a commoner there was no possibility of marrying a margrave.</p>
<p>According to common sense she’d learned from her tutor, it was said that a marriage between high-ranking aristocrats would take place only after obtaining royal approval. And as the social norms since time immemorial had a strict status system, the king wouldn’t allow the marriage of a commoner and a margrave.</p>
<p>Irvan also has no reason to add another notoriety to the stigma he had accumulated so far.</p>
<p>Even if a man and a woman are fond of each other, it doesn’t mean a relationship would last.</p>
<p>Emma lowered her eyes and was lost in thought. She let out a faint sigh without realizing it.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>What was already done was done. Overthinking did not mean that a solution would instantly come to mind, so she decided to stop thinking about it at this point.</p>
<p>“When is Irvan coming?” she muttered.</p>
<p>She stood at the door with her arms crossed. Seeing no sign of him, she shook her head and headed to the kitchen. She thought about drinking a cup of hot tea while viewing the peaceful pond outside the window. She was heading to the kitchen when there was a knock at the entrance of the annex.</p>
<p><em>‘Who’s that?’</em></p>
<p>When she carefully opened the door, Butler Miller was standing in front of the door.</p>
<p>“So you just so happened to be here, Miss Herman,” he said. With an enthusiastic look on his face.</p>
<p>“Yes… And you can call me Emma,” Emma replied cautiously.</p>
<p>“No, no. Aren’t you a guest of Master Irvan? He has also asked me to deliver some things. May I, if you don’t mind, Miss Herman?”</p>
<p>When Emma stepped away from the door to let him in, Miller did a simple hand gesture to the servants standing behind him. Then they all but flew inside, each carrying a box in their arms.</p>
<p>The large boxes in colorful, pastel shades were of different sizes, and there were more than just a couple. The boxes diligently carried by more than ten servants soon piled up like a mountain in the middle of the living room.</p>
<p>Emma looked up at the boxes with a puzzled face. “What is all this?”</p>
<p>Miller replied then, “It is all clothing, madam. These are all from the clothing store you visited last time. The measurements are perfect.”</p>
<p>Come to think of it, all the boxes looked like the ones that had been stacked in layers at the corner of the store.</p>
<p>Emma tilted her head, finding it strange. “It isn’t just a couple of pieces. Why are all these clothes—”</p>
<p>“They were all ordered personally by Master Irvan. He said that you need them, Miss Herman.”</p>
<p>“No. Still, do I need to wear this much stuff here? It’s too much…”</p>
<p>Emma blinked, speechless. Miller quickly said, “There will be lots of opportunities to dress up. Because there’s tea time, dinner, banquets, and even night parties. Oh, right. You must attend today’s dinner, madam.”</p>
<p>“Me…?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Chairman Collin has returned, so Countess Karina is hosting a dinner party. Master Irvan will also be attending, but it may take a long time for the women to prepare.” Miller glanced at his pocket watch as he continued. “Umm, you won’t be late if you start preparing now, madam.”</p>
<p>“When does dinner start?” Emma asked apprehensively.</p>
<p>“In two hours.”</p>
<p>“That’s right around the corner.”</p>
<p>“I suppose so. Even so, I tried to tell you earlier, but you were away…”</p>
<p>Miller’s justification was wrong. Emma was in Van Wert Castle the entire afternoon, alone. People only came looking for Baron Berne or Secretary Laute, so what reason did they have to not know of her whereabouts?</p>
<p><em>‘Well, I am considered suspicious…”</em></p>
<p>Then, had he purposely waited until the party was close to notify her? All that was left was a mere two hours. It was more or less a short period, but one thing was obvious. If she doesn’t choose her clothes properly and start preparing, then she would be greatly humiliated at dinner.</p>
