            <h3>Chapter 26.1</h3>
<p><em>‘Guess?’ </em>It was more luxurious than the rooms Emma had seen in her life!</p>
<p>Irvan mused for a moment. “If you like, you can choose another room. There are two choices; but whatever you choose, it will be better than this one. However, the first place is located outside and the other one is inside. The former has more open space, and the latter is secluded.”</p>
<p>“So the one inside is in here?” Emma confirmed.</p>
<p>“Right.” Irvan nodded.</p>
<p>Emma tried to recall the complex architecture of Van Wert Castle. There were so many other buildings other than the main one. “The one located outside is somewhere else than here?”</p>
<p>“Over that way. It’s behind the garden,” said Irvan, pointing a finger towards a window.</p>
<p>Beyond the curtain was a wide garden with well-trimmed grass, the edge of the vast garden was connected to a small forest. It would be better for Emma to stay out of the main building if she were to lessen her chances of meeting with Countess Karina unexpectedly; staying inside the Van Wert Castle would only do her no good. Moreover, whatever mistakes she had with her mannerisms or actions would be less noticeable if she were far from scrutinizing eyes.</p>
<p>“The outside one would be nice,” she decided after thinking long and hard. Irvan, who had been waiting for her decision with patience, then tugged on the bell pull hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>From the hallway, they could hear the sounds of scurrying and haste, the sound extending towards their front door. Soonafter, there was a knock. Miller entered, politely greeted them, a handful of servants following his tail.</p>
<p>“You called, Master Irvan?” Miller respectfully said.</p>
<p>Irvan waved his hands dismissively. “Who is using the garden cabin?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Mr. Colinas, Master.”</p>
<p>“… Is that so?” Irvan narrowed his eyebrows and asked again. “And the annex near the lake?”</p>
<p>“It is empty, Master.”</p>
<p>“All right. Then we’ll move there, so get everything ready.”</p>
<p>When Irvan simply waved his hand around, issuing an order, Miller blinked at him owlishly. “Right now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, at this very moment.”</p>
<p>As soon as Miller heard that, he courteously bowed to them before hurrying out of the room. NO doubt to get on with his duty in haste.</p>
<p>Emma looked at Irvan, a bit skeptical. “We’ve only arrived today. Is there a need for Miller to rush like that?”</p>
<p>“I understand that you don’t want to be apart from me for a second, but please, just bear with me, Miss Herman,” Irvan replied with a playful smile on his lips and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>“I-it’s not like that…” Emma muttered an excuse, her face turning crimson at his teasing.</p>
<p>“It’s a familiar place for me because it’s my home,” he began seriously, the former playfulness on his face gone. “But to you, it’s a strange place. Have you thought of what can happen to you?”</p>
<p>He was right. Emma hadn’t thought it out well enough. She remembered the way Irvan had treated Countess Van Wert earlier — despite being family, there was a certain kind of alienness on how Irvan treated the countess. As if there was an invisible barrier separating the both of them. Wasn’t that the same way he treated strangers?</p>
<p>Now that Emma thought about it, the two of them certainly didn’t even look alike. Moreover, when she recalled the way Karina had treated Irvan, it was like seeing oil and water mingle. They were opposites.</p>
<p>Emma began to feel lightheaded. Miller said that Irvan was the sole heir to the House of Van Wert — it was obvious that he was a true descendant of the bloodline.</p>
<p>A hunch formed at the back of her mind. “Then the current Countess Van Wert is…”</p>
<p>“You may have guessed it now, but she is not my mother. She is Count Van Wert’s second wife.” Irvan replied. “Furthermore, Lady Karina’s middle name is Muns. She is Karina Muns Van Wert.”</p>
<p>Emma was stunned. The current countess was even part of the famous Muns family? They were a little behind the prominent margraves, but nevertheless, a powerful family that dominated this area.</p>
<p><em>‘So, the Munses and the Van Werts are in-laws…’</em></p>
<p>The most prominent families had woven themselves intricately through marriage. As Emma had thought of earlier, this confirmed her tutor’s words that marriage between noble families were to combine familial forces and powers.</p>
<p><em>‘Since I am a stranger, it will be better not to get too involved…’</em></p>
<p>She’d done well by rejecting Karina’s invitation. Of course, it was possible because of Irvan… And now, she had to think of his words seriously: what <em>would</em>happen to her?</p>
<p>“Then… is there anything I should know beforehand?” she asked in trepidation.</p>
<p>“You’re quite smart.” Irvan laughed. “While Father is lying in bed, Lady Karina is spending time with her younger brother, Collin. He is often simply called the ‘chairman’ since he serves advisory council. Both are prminent figures as they descended from the main line of the Muns family. That’s why they have no problem ruling Reshire. As for me, I do not have the aptitude for that.”</p>
<p>Baron Muns was a renowned aristocrat who dominated the northwest area. He has also served as a royal official for generations. Perhaps, since the Van Wert family had a power of a margrave, the Muns lineage seemed to have delved into the area of civil service officers. Baron Muns’ proficiency in civil affairs was visible with the marriage to the Van Wert family. They gained a symbiotic, political marriage.</p>
