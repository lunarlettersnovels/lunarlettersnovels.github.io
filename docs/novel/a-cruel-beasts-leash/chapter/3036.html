            <p><strong>Chapter 70.2</strong></p>
<p>Irvan sliced the paper with the bloody knife. Then he sliced it again. Just like that, there was a bloody cross on the fancy paper. It was more solemn than anything ever. Lastly, he melted the sealing wax and dropped it on the letter and pushed it with Karina’s symbol ring.</p>
<p>“Left a will as well.”</p>
<p>The last thing he did was put the paper knife in the maid’s hand so it wouldn’t fall. He took the gloves off, put it in his pocket and left. When he came to the north tower’s entrance, the knights were still standing guard just as he had told them to.</p>
<p>“What about Bishop Albert?” he asked.</p>
<p>“He’s coming.”</p>
<p>“Good. It’ll be a great confession.”</p>
<p>Irvan left orders for them to guard the north tower until the Bishop arrived.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Irvan came back to the cottage late at night, smelling like blood.</p>
<p>“You’re back,” Emma greeted, a curious look on her face,</p>
<p>“Mhm.” As Emma greeted him, his sculpture-like face smiled.</p>
<p>“You smell…”</p>
<p>As Emma flinched when she got close. Irvan smiled in reply. “Ah, I stopped by the execution on my way back.” He explained. The underground jail was full of blood from all the executions.</p>
<p>“It smells bad right? I’ll clean up.”</p>
<p>As Emma stepped back in agreement, he immediately went into the bathroom to wash the smell away. When he went out, he wore a thin shirt and sat on the bed all leisurely. His strong, masculine body that was outlined by his thin shirt made her heart flutter.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Irvan, who was lying with his legs wide open, looked down like he was thinking about something. His eyes were half open as he gazed at the floor. As if magnetized, Emma couldn’t help but come near to him.</p>
<p>“Irvan,” she softly called out to him.</p>
<p>“Mhm,” he mumbled, his eyes still trailed to the floor.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking of?”</p>
<p>“I just remembered something annoying.”</p>
<p>“Not everything is finished yet?”</p>
<p>As Emma asked, Irvan thought for a moment and then nodded. For the first time, Emma could clearly see the fatigue in his face.</p>
<p>“Somewhat.”</p>
<p>He smiled and didn’t say anything more about the matter. He opened his arms towards Emma instead. Emma was glad that he wasn’t in a terrible mood about it.</p>
<p>“Come here,” he said.</p>
<p>As Emma went into his embrace, he held her for some time. It was the first time in a long time that they were able to hold each other like this.</p>
<p>Emma felt comforted as she felt his warmth seep into her own flesh. His familiar scent enveloped her, and she could feel her eyes slowly closing towards slumber. As Irvan held Emma, he didn’t say anything for a while.</p>
<p>The room was quiet, save for a heavy silence filled with unspoken worry…</p>
<p>All the allegations against Karina Muns in the court were clear, proven. He ultimately used it to get rid of his cruel stepmother. Uplifting the roots made him also get rid of the disruptions in the Van Wert castle. Irvan was going to walk the path that was supposedly for him, this time without anyone stopping him.</p>
<p><em>‘Count Irvan Van Wert…’’ </em>Now he wasn’t only the captain of the Black Fang nor was he heir anymore – he was Count Van Wert himself. Only the official coronation remained.</p>
<p>When she met this random man in the camp, Emma couldn’t imagine that Irvan’s status was too high for her. She got unconsciously involved with him, like a moth addicted to a flame.</p>
<p>She savoured the warmth from his chest and listened to his heart steadily beat.</p>
<p>Such a moment wouldn’t be privy to hers in the future. Emma solemnly realized that now. In a room full of nobles, officers, and prestigious people, she didn’t belong anywhere. She was still unfamiliar with Reshire; the Van Wert castle wasn’t her final place to settle. Despite everything, Emma was still a foreigner. She just decided to stay for a while as per Irvan’s request.</p>
<p><em>‘I don’t have identity nor the right.’</em></p>
<p>A sudden melancholia washed over her. Her first love was fiery and comforting, but she couldn’t be with him. This was reality.</p>
<p><em>‘I should be leaving soon, but I don’t want to right now…’</em></p>
<p>Emma tried to squash the negative feelings away and focus on the present, when Irvan’s voice suddenly sounded above her.</p>
<p>“Emma,” he called.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>Emma quietly answered and slowly closed her eyes, trying to get rid of the heartache. Irvan’s warmth surrounded her. <em>‘This should be good enough. I can’t get too greedy,’ </em>she consoled herself.</p>
