            <p><b>Chapter 6.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Emma looked back on her memories, she felt as if she could remember as if she were digging through a hazy mist at dawn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When her nostrils flared while eating a piece of bread, the man’s insensitive gaze glided toward her, looking far off with a boring expression as he leaned comfortably on the sofa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His still blue-gray eyes narrowed sharply. The foretelling gaze was quite eerie. Emma’s spine shivered as if a sharp blade had touched her cheek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-n-nothing.”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">She hurriedly glossed over and avoided his gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gosh, no matter how foreign it smelled, it was rude of her to blatantly sniff the fresh food. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry.”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma apologized with her lips barely moving. When she did that, the man’s eyes still glued on her narrowed even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I brought these in this morning, so they shouldn’t be spoiled.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, okay. The food is all right. Anyhow, I think my hands stink.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as she set the bread down that she was eating and hesitated, the man, without saying a word, lifted a finger toward behind the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His heavily bandaged hand was pointing at the hallway.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is water.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma, shifting her body toward the faintly lit hallway, could soon find a bathroom with large buckets of water and large antique bronze tubs.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">She squatted down with a bucket of water in her hand and washed her body, but suddenly she was thirsty.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma was thinking about drinking the water in the bucket, but then it bothered her that this water was only used for washing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking around, wondering if there was any drinking water, the kitchen on the other side of the hallway fell into her vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me, I am thirsty, so if it isn’t too much to ask, can I g…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Emma, who had escaped the hallway, came out into the living room and murmured timidly, something dull cut through the air.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bang, bang.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She quickly closed her mouth and listened in case she’d heard something wrong, and there was a dull noise at regular intervals.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bang, bang, bang.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The source of the banging sound was the front door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The single tightly closed door vibrated weakly, spreading a dull echo throughout the room.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘If someone comes looking for that man at this hour…’</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment when her thoughts flowed quickly, she stiffened.</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Don’t tell me…’</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Emma was on high alert, the knocks became increasingly louder.</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thump, thump.</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The loud knock at the door confidently signaled that a visitor had arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma trembled when she recalled how desperate she was to escape.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Have I been caught?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hunch penetrated her mind; by the looks of it, Dora and Otto had arrived. They had been chasing Emma after all.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There were no other houses nearby, and her trail had been cut off around here, so no doubt she would have been caught taking refuge here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma had kind of expected things to turn out this way, but there was hope in her mind she was safe enough.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had hoped that they would give up on finding her and just back down.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">But those terrible bastards seemed to be locked in a fierce chase despite the bad weather. Only to achieve their purpose, they would not care about retreating.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was simple as it was inevitable that the chasers would find this cabin.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep in the mountains filled with the roars and howls of monsters and predators, the only place around was this dwelling.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thump, thump thump!</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stronger the knocking got, the more Emma’s chest tightened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Water is on the kitchen shelf,”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the man said softly; then he got up from his seat, glancing at the front door, perhaps knowing how Emma felt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the handsome man stood tall in the living room silently, his balanced physique wrapped by shirt and pants showed off his presence.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He was attractively tall, like a thick pillar and broad shoulders.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">His presence alone seemed to fill  the vast, desolate interior. There was a terrible sense of intimidation in full bloom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emma stared blankly at him, forgetting her thirst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His physique was flawless, and the closer she looked at him, the more she noticed the tight muscles that reminded her of a trained warrior.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He was not of the rugged, thick muscular type, but his lean body, one head taller than average, showed off his masculinity. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Is he a soldier? No, a knight?’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She once remembered that a knight who had once won a horseracing competition hosted by the county councilor in Summerville had the same physique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, his cool, sharp impression was intimidating enough.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, even though he only stared at Emma, she got cold feet and her heart became heavy as if a knife was held at her throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man had a dangerous and fierce air around him, but on the surface, he was insensitively expressionless.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the feeling of seeing a vicious beast sitting leisurely in the grass, hiding its claws.</span></p>
