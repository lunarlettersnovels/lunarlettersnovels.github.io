            <p><strong>Chapter 59.2</strong><u></u></p>
<p>When Collin touched the maids, Karina treated them sternly with a beating. The opposite was also true. Everyone had been hushed about it, but the twins indiscriminately indulged in sex from a very young age. Perhaps, that might be  the reason for Karina’s infertility.</p>
<p>The two of them lied in the same bed every day, coveting their servants as if they were tasting a delicacy. Rumors spread that while Collin was torturing the maids and ladies-in-waiting, Karina was doing it to the knights. Cleaning up the mess afterwards was entirely up to Monte.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he proved his usefulness again this time, so it was now time to help Collin improve. The Muns brother and sister were extremely violent and vicious, but reward and punishment were certain, and if the result was satisfactory, a good reward was guaranteed. The unprecedented generous reward was enough for a person to stay silent and be loyal. Monte had also accumulated a tremendous amount of wealth that a doctor would never dream of.</p>
<p>His mind wandered. <em>‘… Judging from the symptoms, it is a paralyzing poison. But there are many of them.’</em></p>
<p>Like Layna, who first pointed out the cause of the incident, Monte also had no idea what Emma used exactly to paralyze Collin.</p>
<p><em>‘Etona, Volco, and Samedin are the strong ones. They are also medicinal herbs that are handled by apothecaries in the city. And, although rare, there is also a possibility of Kutalin, which can only be refined using specialized knowledge. It’s something that can only be done with skill and experience…’</em></p>
<p>The symptoms were clear, but the cause was an unresolved problem. Emma’s belongings sent from her basement were all broken and useless. Monte sighed irritably. He reached out carefully to check Collin’s condition, opening his eyelids, when the door opened in a flurry.</p>
<p>“What about the Countess?!” The butler shouted as if the world had collapsed for a moment. “Wasn’t she here? Where is she?!”</p>
<p>Turning his head, Monte fixed his gaze on the butler. Miller’s face, which suddenly seemed to have aged for 10 years, was a spectacle. Miller was originally a vassal of Count Van Wert, but he was won over by Karina. He was promised a large sum of money, and now he was busy serving his new owner as faithfully as a dog with a delicious piece of meat in front of him.</p>
<p>“The Countess has just gone back to her bedroom,” Monte replied.  Then as if remembering something, he said, “What’s the matter? Is there any problem with Ms. Herman…?” Monte asked after carefully examining Miller’s anxious hands clutching the handkerchief and his pale face.</p>
<p>If an ordinary woman had been used by more than thirty men who had consumed a lot of Tasugari, she would definitely become pregnant. However, it was only a matter of time before the news of Emma’s imprisonment was reported to Irvan, who was in another country. If he instantly came back on a horseback for fear of his woman to be hurt at the hands of other men, it was Monte’s responsibility to keep her in a good condition until then.</p>
<p>After all, Countess Karina had chosen Emma Herman to be Irvan’s partner. With no background, and with low social status, she was suitable for this kind of thing. The question was whether or not she would give birth at an early date. The child’s gender didn’t even matter; it was already planned to be announced that she had given birth to a son. If Miss Herman became pregnant, Karina would immediately search every single pregnant woman in the Muns Territory.</p>
<p>“Miss Herman? No, t-that’s not the problem…” Miller muttered in despair , then suddenly screamed like a madman. “He is back! Mr. Irvan is back! And he just headed to the dungeons! What are we supposed to do about this?!”</p>
<p>Monte, who had been worried about Emma the whole time and was caught off guard. His mouth was hanging open for a moment. He blinked his eyes confusedly.</p>
<p>“… How?”</p>
<p><em>‘Irvan had returned to Van Wert Castle in the middle of the night?’ </em>he thought incredulously. The timing made no sense at all. The Lojak area was half a day from here. Such was the case with a carriage, but even if you ride a horse and take no breaks, it was difficult to speed up because of the rough mountain path.</p>
<p><em>‘Moreover, hadn’t Countess Karina taken action to stop the werewolves from attacking the Van Wert Knights, so that Count Edner would withdraw his forces farther away? He even ran through the night in a mountain filled with monster attractors?’</em></p>
<p>“There is no way he could have time to spare…” Monte muttered, frozen.</p>
<p>When the monster wave broke out in Lojak this time, the Muns siblings considered it a great opportunity. So, they worked hard to expand the damage and take the hold of the Knights. Monte wanted to pretend that he didn’t know, but Collin was excited for too long. The moment he had seen Emma, he wanted to plant his seed in her stomach and make the child the next Count of Van Wert.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter now! Mr. Irvan is here! The human butcher, the slaughter machine! <em>That</em> Mr. Irvan! What are we supposed to do with this? Ah!!” Miller continued screaming. He was trembling as if a disaster was imminent. Then, as if suddenly coming back to his senses, he hurried toward the Countess’s bedroom.</p>
