            <p><b>Chapter 60.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone is dead!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the horrors of the dungeon was spread, the castle turned upside down. The number of dead bodies was thirty-five. Among them, three were official knights of the count, seven were apprentice knights, and the other  twenty-five were soldiers. After the bodies were hurriedly recovered, an emergency meeting was held at the castle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opinions differed as to whether it should be dealt with under the territorial law since the deceased included knights who had been knighted by Van Wert, or whether it should be dealt with according to the additional law because Irvan was involved. Some were torn about whether to ask the royal family for a fair judgment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How can Mr. Irvan…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t believe it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is unheard of! Heavens!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting was held for a long time due to divided opinions; it was difficult to reach a conclusion. Among them, there were people who claimed that the royal family should be informed. However, Countess Karina rejected their appeal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It happened on our side, so we have to deal with it ourselves. Asking outsiders for help will leave a stain in many ways,” she said. “If this spreads to the outside world, how will we save face?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vassals, who protested against Countess Karina’s words, were furious. “We can’t do that! The situation is already out of control,” one argued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then what should we do about this? Thirty-five people died overnight. It’s a terrible thing a normal person wouldn’t want to imagine. Someone has to take  heavy responsibility for this disastrous situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my, oh my…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the old man who stroked his white beard and groaned, Countess Karina tried to hide her smile of satisfaction. Although seemingly neutral, many of the middle-class elders have already been bought by her money. The vassals who have a say in Van Wert Castle are in a position to choose whether to support Irvan or not. In the case where there’s a clash of opinions, silence in the guise of neutrality has a profound effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Isn’t Mr. Irvan the leader of the Knights of the Black Fangs? Which leader in the world kills his own men?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right, we can’t just sit back and watch. Besides, this isn’t the first time! Two apprentice knights were unjustly killed last time. But now, he has killed even the official knights! Not to mention, it’s not just one or two people; there’s a huge loss of life. To lose human power by a lone person’s selfish conduct is  not only a territory’s loss, but a national one!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No! Mr. Irvan is the next Count. If Mr. Irvan suffers anything unfavorable, the fate of Reshire cannot be predicted,” another declared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It does not cost a penny or two to train a knight, and you have to invest in it for a long time. Aren’t they all the key forces and pillars of the territory? The pillars supporting the roof are falling apart! How could you let this matter go?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even so, Mr. Irvan-”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s enough! Time will prove who cares and cherishes Reshire more!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karina listened contently to the heated arguments. As the Van Wert faction in support of Irvan receded, the neutrality grew. Karina gave a satisfied smile to the vassal who had gone on to become the instigator. Whenever someone takes the lead and insists on putting a bell around an unruly cat’s neck, only then do people become afraid of it. And when there is uncertainty from fear, an opportunity to seize the situation presents itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s decide by show of hands!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s do it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the fairest and most objective way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, the majority opinion gathered. After the shouting matches, the meeting room was now enveloped in heavy silence. Among them, Countess Karina glanced at their faces with a look of remorse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t give birth to him myself… but I consider Irvan as my child. I gave birth to him by heart. He is more precious to me than anyone else. He was originally a smart and intelligent kid. It is a shame for his future to be ruined because of his minor flaws and weaknesses. Please take this into consideration and think of another way,” she said, her voice steady.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Irvan’s life is harmed, Van Wert will lose its successor. In that event, an appropriate successor would be nominated from the collateral family. However, a supervisor could also be dispatched from the royal family, making them in control. It’s only recently that the king was eager to create a direct decree to strengthen the royal power and increase tax revenue.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘You can’t ruin something that’s almost done,’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Karina thought.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">By legality, Countess Karina can’t keep her seat. Even more if Irvan is deposed. Then, the Muns, who have worked hard for more than a decade to take over Reshire, would retreat empty-handed. That’s not their plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After hearing the Countess speak, I realized that we were short-minded,” one of the vassals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But there’s no other way around. Do you have any ideas?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countess Karina sighed, receiving the worried gaze of an elderly. “…I don’t know.” She frowned as if she were very troubled, and then slowly opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is caused by a monster’s intrusion. It’s a tragedy that the Werewolf, which was secretly locked in the dungeon, escaped… That’s how it’s going to be announced,” Karina said. “Compensation will be made accordingly. But you all know the truth. We should have an in-depth discussion later on about the responsibilities that a Knight Commander should bear.”</span></p>
