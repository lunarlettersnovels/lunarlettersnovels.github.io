            <p><strong>Chapter 27.2</strong></p>
<p>“Shall we start?” Irvan suddenly said, making her body tense in anticipation. Irvan gave her no time to breath, taking his mounds into his mouth again as Emma’s fingertips and toes slowly became numb. “How about it?” he asked.</p>
<p>Emma breathed shakily. “…they might hear us.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s true.” Lowering his voice to a whisper, Irvan smiled impishly as if he was having fun.</p>
<p>Emma, barely remembering his warning, chewed the bottom of her lips shut to swallow her m*ans. But Irvan mercilessly broke her defenses by his wicked tongue. Then, as if teasing her, he said again, “We have to do it quietly. Right?”</p>
<p>As much as Emma wanted to shot him a glare, her senses pervaded her thoughts and she could only mumbled a desperate “Yes.”</p>
<p>At her acquiesce, Irvan attacked her peaks with more vigor than before. He teased her like a madman, reveling in her barely supressed moans and watery eyes looking at him in accusation. When he molded her peaks into his rough palms, Emma’s lips finally opened and her sweet m*ans burst out.</p>
<p>“Ohh! Oh, yes! Ah!” Thoughs heady, her back arched and twisted against him.</p>
<p>Irvan chuckled. “Seeing that your n*pples are this hard, you must be a soaking mess below. Should I check?”</p>
<p>While Emma’s body was shivering, she felt something slip between two defenseless legs. Irvan’s fingers caressed the wet surface, spread her hot lips apart and dug inside a swirling heat of nectar. Emma’s knees buckled as she fought a scream from bursting out her lips. Her inner walls which filled with hot nectar obscenely enveloped his fingers. The sound of wet liquid squelching against his fingers could be heard audibly.</p>
<p>“Soaking wet. Just as I expected…”</p>
<p>His deep and low voice sounded s*nsual in her ears. The long, thick fingers that buried deep inside her cave came back out and touched her sensitive clit*ris.</p>
<p>“Your pussy is on fire,” he wickely whispered.</p>
<p>Her pale thighs shivered. He slid his finger up and done, teasing the sensitive nib with his migle finger as her sweet nectar flowed from within, wetting his fingers.</p>
<p>“You’re dripping.”</p>
<p>His fingers hovered over her deep well and the pink clit*ris. He teased her brutally before he pushed past her moist petals and inside her hot walls.</p>
<p>“What an er*tic scent. How you tempt me so…”</p>
<p>Emma’s mind was numb as she struggled to contain the sounds from her mouth. The decadence was too overwhelming. Constant honey flowed from her nether region as if rebelling with her rationality. And as Irvan’s thick and long middle finger dug deeply into her hot, wet hole, Emma threw her head back and released a m*an.</p>
<p>“Yes! Oh, Irvan!”</p>
<p>Her thighs shook. The walls which embraced his fingers contracted and shivered. Then the fingers inside here began to move skillfully.</p>
<p>“You’re getting warmer,” Irvan remarked.</p>
<p>His fingers, which thrust in and out of her gradually squeezed deeper into her cramped flesh. Whenever his long middle finger rubbed inside Emma’s inner walls, the sounds of wet felsh reverberated in the bathroom.</p>
<p>“You swallow my fingers well,” he said before pokeing his fingertips deeply into her narrow hole. Liquid flowed out from their combined flesh. Emma could vividly feel his knuckles against her slippery petals.</p>
<p>“Munch. Munch. It’s swallowing me up.”</p>
<p>There was a loud noise whenever his finger and her petals came into contact and withdrew. The wetness from inside continued to flow out obscenely according to his hand movements.</p>
<p>“Here.” Suddenly, he stretched his thumb up. Then, with his middle finger embedded inside her, he pressed on her clit*ris with his thumb and rubbed it.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Ah!”</p>
<p>As the sensitive nub was was pressed, her wet petals contracted further around his finger.</p>
<p>“f I touch it like this,” Irvan’s thick thumb covered the clitoris once again. Then, he rubbed over it gently, making Emma’s body shiver in pleasure. “You like that? Huh?”</p>
<p>“Yes… Ah. Oh yes.”</p>
<p>Emma was caught up in a tsunami of pleasure and couldn’t come to her senses. She shuddered and m*aned, completely under his mercy.</p>
<p>Irvan smiled. “I knew you’d answer honestly. You’re dripping so much…”</p>
<p>He continued rubbing and squeezing the clit*ris that tensed and the wet petals on both sides below it. Finally, when he took out his fingers and lifted them, they were covered with sticky liquid as if he had stuck his hand in a jar of honey.</p>
<p>“So er*tic.”</p>
<p>With the corners of his mouth slightly crooked upwards in satisfaction, he bent his fingertips and rubbed his thumb and index finger. A long, thin silver thread hung in the air like a spider web, wet and shining white.</p>
<p>“How obscene. I like it,” Irvan muttered lascivi*usly, staring at his wet fingers as if enchanted just, before slightly licking them with the tip of his tongue.</p>
