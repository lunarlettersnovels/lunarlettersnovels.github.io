            <p><strong>Chapter 41.2</strong></p>
<p>“Oh, ah!”</p>
<p>When his member fully slid out, then thrusted long and deep inside her wet walls, the m*an from Emma’s lips echoed across the room.</p>
<p><em>Thud! Thud! </em>Amidst that, the knocking at the front door did not stop. Perhaps their patience had run out; it was louder than earlier. They seemed to be knocking, having known that someone was inside.</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Irvan muttered with annoyance.</p>
<p>He propped Emma up while they were still connected in the middle. When her body was lifted into the air with his thick p*nis still tight inside of her, Emma urgently stretched out her arms and hugged his neck.</p>
<p>“N-no!”</p>
<p>“No, what?”</p>
<p>He strutted along, Emma hanging from him and stopped in front of the bed. Emma was anticipating a fall as she held on tight, but for a second he made not a single motion.</p>
<p>“…Irvan?” she asked.</p>
<p>As his eyes turned towards her, Irvan’s lips twisted up. Then his sight gradually lowered and shifted below Emma’s collarbone.</p>
<p>“You said no because you thought I was going to do something?” he asked mischievously.</p>
<p>The eyes fixated on her white chest seemed to be slightly drowsy, but soon he pulled out his wet tongue and licked her n*pple. He teased her with the tip of his tongue before opening his mouth wide and taking a full bite. As if he couldn’t stand it any longer.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>As he bit the erect n*pple where it hurt, Emma m*aned, bending her neck back. An unknown sensation of pain and pleasure seethed from his warm lips.</p>
<p>“Or on the other hand are you hoping I do something for you? Is that it?”</p>
<p>His tongue was wet, hot, and merciless. Her mounds tightened with every touch. Before long, the tips  which he teased with his mouth swelled pink-red, coated with his warm saliva. Irvan chewed softly on her n*pples, and a tingling sensation spread from Emma’s br*asts.</p>
<p>“Ah.. oh.. oh..”</p>
<p>As Emma’s m*ans burst out, her thin waist held in Irvan’s firm grip twisted like a concave bow. She flexed her bottom and spine to remain balanced in the air. While she squirmed and clung to him, he licked both of her mounds several times. Only after some time did Irvan finally stop with his onslaught.</p>
<p>“You tighten up down there every time I suck. You make it unbearable,” he murmured, a satisfied look on his face as he stared at her violated tips. Emma remained breathless, swaying, still attached to his body.  “I guess you, too, like the stimulation, Emma… I can’t bear how wet you are inside.”</p>
<p>Then, with strong arms Irvan clutched Emma’s waist, lifted her over his head.</p>
<p>“Hey! Whoa whoa! What are you—” Emma protested.  The member inside her slid out, and she felt warm liquid that was trapped inside freely gushed out. Emma trembled at the loss of contact as her body was lifted into the air, almost touching the ceiling. Irvan placed both her thighs around his head, then pressed his face straight into her open thighs.</p>
<p>“What a nice p*ssy…” he said deviously, his hot breath touching her open folds.  “I’m going to drink everything that spills out.”</p>
<p>Emma grabbed his head for support, as his arms steadied her. “Ah!”</p>
<p>He stuck his long tongue into the narrow hole that had been filled with his member until a while ago, then licked her entire v*lva, sucking up the liquid. He repeatedly teased her womanhood with the tip and flat of his tongue</p>
<p>“Ahh! Yes!”</p>
<p>Emma’s body shook at the unimaginable position, and the intense concentration of Irvan’s caressing. Irvan grabbed her arms and legs firmly  to keep her from moving, and his onslaughts continued. She gripped Irvan’s hair with a loud m*an as his tongue wriggled and licked her insides, as if looking for treasure.  As his actions continually stirred her smooth walls, Emma felt as if her soaked region would melt away. Irvan would instantly suck any of the liquid that overflowed; it was simply a mercilessly sens*al and merciless attack.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>At once, her head turned white at the soaring pleasure. Emma wriggled and trembled like a bare tree in the wind. She couldn’t bear it, couldn’t stand it. Irvan pulled his tongue out of the cramped tightness of her quivering p*ssy and swept the sweet nectar away with his tongue. The tip of his soft tongue stimulated her erect clit*ris. Emma’s whole bottom trembled.</p>
<p>“Ohh!” Emma cried. “Ah, it’s too…” She couldn’t find words to speak because she was suffocated by the stimulating pleasure. Her consciousness seemed to drift off.</p>
<p>“Is it good?” Irvan asked, a smirk on his face.</p>
<p>Satisfied, he settled Emma into the bed. She had been floating in the air the whole time. When she slid down his chest and her bare feet touched the floor, she could finally feel a sense of stability. Irvan then turned her around, and made her lie face down on the soft mattress.</p>
