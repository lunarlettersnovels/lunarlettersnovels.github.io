        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Memorial Gala</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong didn’t care what Xiao Chengyu did to him. He perfectly fulfilled the director’s requirements while building a good relationship with the staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the entire day of filming, Xiao Chengyu didn’t come looking for trouble with him and wasn’t aloof at the scene. This made him feel better and the shooting speed was naturally good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 5 p.m., Lu Fan brought him to a high-end clothing store. He picked up the clothes that were tailored for them before he dragged Shan Yatong to the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although this wasn’t an awards ceremony, this was more important than those messy awards ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jing Anjue was a superstar when he was alive, so the amount of attention he received was distinguished. Coupled this time with Sky Crown’s planning, the media around the world would report on this gala, so those who came to the event naturally had to pay more attention to the appearance of their attires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The memorial gala would be held in the city’s most famous opera house. Before Shan Yatong could get out of the car, he noticed the constant sounds of the shutters and the dazzling, flashing lights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the memorial party began, all the media gathered at the entrance. They stood on both sides of the carpet, and there were also some fans of Jing Anjue. These fans of Jing Anjue were from domestic and abroad. Some of them even had tears streaming down their faces as they held the photos of Jing Anjue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Shan Yatong got out of the car, the flash almost made him unable to open his eyes. Under such circumstances, he naturally wouldn’t reveal a perfect smile. He just lowered his head and ignored the questions from the reporters around him as he hurried towards the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was unknown how many television stations were broadcasting live. Even so, it wasn’t a matter of being praised by the media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a gold-rank manager, Lu Fan naturally understood this reasoning. As he blocked the reporters’ questions, he was careful not to offend the media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a whole, the atmosphere at the scene was exceptionally lively. In another sense, it was a little less lamentable. However, the media were the ones who needed to be more explosive. There were also a few who were truly reminiscing about the person who had died four years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before entering the studio, Shan Yatong turned around to look at the media reporters and the artists who were standing in the same spot as the reporters. With a sneer, he entered the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, Shan Yatong didn’t want to participate in this memorial party. He found a seat with his name on it and sat down. He looked at the big shots in front of him and the red stars[mfn]Popular stars[/mfn] behind him. When did he know these people? Without friendship, what could there be to commemorate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong was sitting at the front of the stage. This was a memorial gala arranged by the Sky Crown Entertainment, and Shan Yatong was a newcomer who had been trained by the Sky Crown for a lot of money. This position could also show the status of an artist in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The closer they were to the front, the more famous they would become. The closer they were to the back, the less attention they would get in the industry. Every industry has its own rules; not to mention the flamboyant and intricacy of the entertainment industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan was a gold-rank manager and Shan Yatong was his only artist, so he sat beside him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aren’t you going to help?” Shan Yatong knew that the recent commemorative gala had left the planning department and some of the top managers extremely busy. This included Lu Fan. Moreover, Jing Anjue was an artist under his name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan wasn’t in a good mood. When he heard Shan Yatong’s question, he was slightly taken aback before saying, “Things are almost done. I also want to rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His favorite artist. When he thought of his death, he still felt regretful. There was no pretense, just regret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong lowered his head, his face expressionless. “You still have to go on stage later. Don’t think too much.” He raised his head and looked at Tang Ruanqing, who was sitting in the front row. “No matter what, the past is the past. It’s meaningless to forget or miss it too much. It’s better to let nature take its course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan thought it was a little funny. A nineteen-year-old boy was comforting him; a man who was already in his 30s. However, his words made sense. It would be best if he kept his temper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, Lu Fan hadn’t really come to understand Shan Yatong and he didn’t think much of the young man. Although the young man had a faint expression on his face most of the time, there were times when he felt that he was unfathomable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the only word to describe him. Even though he was only a nineteen-year-old boy that couldn’t even be considered a man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start of the evening party, the big screen began to broadcast Jing Anjue’s life events, stills, life photos, as well as some things that he had said and done as a philanthropist. The background music was profoundly sad and the atmosphere was quite depressing. Shan Yatong felt speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He felt uncomfortable for some artists who couldn’t cry but their eyes were red with pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, another low yet graceful female voice read the eulogy, expressing the world’s longing for this outstanding Heavenly King Superstar. The artists below the stage expressed their grief and sorrow even more than their parents’ deaths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong’s eyes reddened as he complied with the flow. He lowered his head, showing the longing and sorrow of a younger generation for his senior. The scene was solemn and ceremonial. Shan Yatong thought to himself, that if anyone sneezed at this time, they might be killed in a blink of an eye, and the newspaper tomorrow would be full of negative news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A song sung by Jing Anjue was playing at the venue. The melody was wistful and lingering, and the previous host appeared again. However, this time, he led a teenager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young man on stage was talking about how miserable he was and how he yearned to learn. Jing Anjue knew how to support and encourage him. BALABALA was a big part of it, but it only showed that Jing Anjue was a great person and had remarkable acting skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong remembered that he had once established a charity foundation; it was rare for them to be able to find these people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the large screen filled with signatures from the people he had sponsored, Shan Yatong felt that he was actually a saintly artist.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was…An illusion, right?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the stage, one by one, misty-eyed veteran artists began to tell two or three things about Jing Anjue. Shan Yatong lowered his head and rolled his eyes. These people may not even have talked to them for more than a hundred words, and then they all became good friends. It really left him speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nostalgic words were more or less the same just as the people acting. It wasn’t sincere. When it was time for the performance, Shan Yatong prepared to go on stage. He was led backstage by Lu Fan; he then saw Heavenly King Xiao beside Lin Yuxin, saying something. Lin Yuxin looked somewhat lonely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re disgusting. They’re just taking advantage of this to stand out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuxin tried her best to keep her voice down, but Shan Yatong heard some of it. It seemed that she was angry about the behavior of those people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan saw this situation, dry coughed, and interrupted their conversation, “Qishen, Yuxin, get ready to go on stage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavenly King Xiao saw that beside Lu Fan was Yatong. He looked at Lin Yuxin, nodding, “Got it, aren’t we waiting for Yatong together?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan pushed his glasses, and said to Shan Yatong, “You pay more attention. I have something to do so I’ll leave first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong wasn’t a fool. Of course, he saw Lu Fan’s abnormality. He slightly nodded, didn’t say anything, and just closed the door of the dressing room, isolating the noise from outside of the corridor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sister Yuxin, they’re just old stars anyway. Why do you have to see them? Who can’t see it? They like to put their faces on the ground and others can’t help it.” Lin Yuxin was surprised by the obvious irony in Shan Yatong’s tone because he always smiled gently and rarely heard him speak so rudely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuxin was in a better mood when she heard those words. She gazed at Xiao Qishen and said, “I’ll go to the bathroom first. Yatong, wait with Heavenly King Xiao on stage; my appearance time will be behind you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that the door was opened again and then closed, Shan Yatong had a faint smile on his mouth. No matter what, she was a person who genuinely misses him, and had nothing to do with his reputation at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t know when Xiao Qishen had come to his side. With a smile, he said, “This is the first time I learned that Yatong hated those kinds of artists.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong frowned, “Honestly, this has nothing to do with my behavior, but this kind of commemoration is meaningless, but it makes the dead restless. Jing Anjue may not necessarily like this kind of nostalgia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re saying that the memorial party I’ve given for him is making him restless?” The door was suddenly opened. Tang Ruanqing pushed the door open, his face was very unsightly; as if his heart was abandoned with a wave of embarrassing anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation was surprisingly unexpected. Shan Yatong didn’t expect Tang Ruanqing to come here at this time. He unconsciously frowned. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did he speak so carelessly? Or did he say that since he was used to saying such words in front of Xiao Qishen?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t a good thing when one has this as a habit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that Shan Yatong was silent, Xiao Qishen smiled and said, “Cousin, you’re so busy in front. Why are you here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tang Ruanqing glanced at him. “If I hadn’t come, how would I know that my memorial party was unnecessary in his eyes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong remained silent. He looked at Xiao Qishen who was obviously trying to protect him and slowly said, “What do you think, Chairman Tang?” He looked at him firmly and said, “It’s not what others say. It’s what you think. What I say is just my opinion. Why should you ask others to have the same opinion as you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that said, he nodded at Tang Ruanqing, who still had an ugly expression on his face. Then, he turned around and walked out of the door. He turned around and said, “Brother Xiao, it’s time for us to go on stage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good.” Xiao Qishen followed without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A light flashed through Shan Yatong’s eyes. At that moment, a smart person shouldn’t have followed him, and Xiao Qishen was a very smart individual. He called Xiao Qishen because he wanted to see if Xiao Qishen would treat him well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone could do a good job in a big place, but small details couldn’t be displayed just by acting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the charming man walking beside him, it was the first time that Shan Yatong felt this way. Perhaps this person really has no hidden purpose in treating him well.</span></p>
