            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Birthday Invitation</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tang Ruanqing walked out of the elevator, he saw the young man standing in the corridor. He looked up at the world outside the clear glass window, expression vacant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stared blankly at the side of the youth. In that instant, the youth’s figure coincided with a figure deep in his memory, making him unable to break his peace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, a handsome young man walked up to the youth. He held a can of coconut milk in his hand and stuffed it into the young man’s hand, with a face of a scoundrel he had never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his memory, although the young man wasn’t serious, he still had an evil smile on his face. He has never been like a ruffian, and his goal was only to let the young man drink the coconut milk he gave to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tang Ruanqing withdrew his gaze and unconsciously relaxed his footsteps. He chose a different direction and left. The warmth between the two made him unable to step in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After walking to the office and sitting down, Zhang Feng came in with a file bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tang Ruanqing looked at the thing in Zhang Feng’s hand. “This is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A photo of Shan Yatong’s product endorsement.” Zhang Feng placed the portfolio on Tang Ruanqing’s desk and thought for a moment. “He’s an outstanding artist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh?” Tang Ruanqing raised his eyebrows and glanced at Zhang Feng, who didn’t look like he was joking. He took out the photos from the file and took out the stunning photos on the top.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young man in the photo stood on a European carved balcony, with large white roses blooming beside him. The young man looked up at the sky, his hair was slightly dyed golden. He reached out to block the dazzling sunlight. The exquisite watch on his wrist seemed to add a bit of elegance to the young man; just like a lonely prince, waiting for someone to wake him up from the loneliness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was just a profile, but it made people feel the low-key luxury. Tang Ruanqing didn’t look at the photos below. He just looked at the profile of the youth looking at the sky and said with a sigh, “Yes, very outstanding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the afterglow of the sunlight, the young man’s tea-colored eyes also seemed to be dyed with gold. It was actually a little seductive. Tang Ruanqing felt that he couldn’t continue to look at it, because if he continued to stare at it, his heart would lose its original trajectory and move in a direction that he didn’t dare to think about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Lu Fan arrived at the company, he saw an annoying guy circling around the artist under his name. He frowned. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could it be that this Xiao Qishen had been frozen? Otherwise, why would he have so much free time now?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certain Heavenly King eagerly opened the can and inserted a straw into it. Then, he moved closer to Shan Yatong and said, “This brand of coconut milk tastes very good. It definitely doesn’t contain melamine. It’s non-toxic and doesn’t have any side effects. It’s five deers and five cans of deer milk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong took the coconut milk and took a sip before he said, “Five deers produces milk powder, not coconut milk. It can hold five cans of melamine from five deer?” He glanced at the brand. “Isn’t this the brand you endorsed?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen nodded. “Anyway, this company is offering me drinks for free, so I don’t mind. However, I heard that this company has invited Jing Anjue to endorse before. Do you know about this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong continued drinking the coconut milk and nodded, indicating that he knew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen looked at Shan Yatong with a smile. He seemed to be happy that he was willing to drink his own coconut milk. When he saw that he had finished the bottle, he proceeded to take the empty bottle from Shan Yatong’s hand and threw it into the trash can that was five meters away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He turned around and saw Lu Fan walking towards Shan Yatong. He seemed to be holding something similar to an invitation card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He furrowed his brows and put his hands in his pockets as he slowly approached the two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yatong, this is the invitation card for Luo Yanqian’s birthday party. It’s in the Luo family’s residence.” Lu Fan handed the invitation card to Shan Yatong. “Luo Yanqian’s manager just sent it over. If you want to go, I’ll cancel your announcement tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong took the invitation. It wasn’t printed by the computer, but written in a forceful pen. The source of the invitation was clearly written by Luo An.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Luo An?” Shan Yatong raised his head and asked Lu Fan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is Luo Yanqian’s name. His real name is Luo An.” Lu Fan pushed his glasses. He suddenly remembered that many years ago, in the middle of a thunderstorm, that person had sent Luo An, who had run away from home, back to the Luo family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong nodded. Luo An…The name sounded familiar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suddenly remembered that Luo Yanqian had already mentioned the birthday banquet a long time ago. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did he reply?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Shan Yatong shook his head. No matter what, they were going to be filming together next week. If the atmosphere became awkward because of a birthday party, it wouldn’t be a wise choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He closed the invitation and said, “Help me cancel tonight’s announcement. Sorry to trouble you.” He furrowed his brows. It would be better for him to either give the gift money directly or to choose a gift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve already prepared a gift for you,” Lu Fan seemed to have expected his decision. “Luo Yanqian’s favorite artist is Jing Anjue. I have a special edition of Jing Anjue’s personal. I’ll bring it over to you later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong nodded without any objection. He put the invitation into his pocket and turned around to see Xiao Qishen standing behind him, taking a step back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does Yatong have an invitation as well? I also have one. We’ll go together then,” Xiao Qishen said, dismissing the idea of not going before. The two of them leaned on Shan Yatong’s shoulder. “I’ll pick you up in the afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan’s eyes were sharp as he looked at Xiao Qishen’s claw on Shan Yatong’s shoulder. He pulled Shan Yatong over and inexpressively looked at Xiao Qishen. “Heavenly King Xiao, Xie Xun is looking for you. He said that there was an invitation in the trash can. Do you still want it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, really? I have no idea which cleaner accidentally threw my invitation away.” Xiao Qishen smiled and waved at Shan Yatong. “Yatong, I’ll go take a look first.” Turning around, Xiao Qishen gritted his teeth. Lu Fan was a roadblock!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heavenly King Xiao, take care.” Lu Fan continued to push his glasses. Xiao Qishen was dead!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lu Fan…” Shan Yatong calmly glanced at Lu Fan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?” Lu Fan smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t push your glasses. If you push them again, they will fall off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan: “……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen returned to his own lounge and picked up the invitation card from the trash can. He looked at the printed words on it and said, “Luo Yanqian…” When he saw the invitation card that Luo Yanqian had personally written, he understood that Luo Yanqian’s thoughts on Shan Yatong might not be that simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He fiddled with the invitation in his hand and narrowed his eyes. The scoundrel who had been with Shan Yatong had long since disappeared. He wanted to see what Luo Yanqian would want to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a knock on the door. Xiao Qishen placed the invitation on the table. “Come in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Xie Xun entered the room, he saw the red invitation that had been transferred from the trash can to the table. He rudely sat down on the sofa. “Are you going tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen nodded without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But tonight, a person in charge of a major international brand would be talking to you about a commercial, even if that was the case ……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Help me get rid of it,” Xiao Qishen stood up and looked out the window. “Old Xie, even if I lose an international brand endorsement, I don’t want to lose the person I love.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun didn’t expect Xiao Qishen to express his feelings so directly. He frowned and said, “Qishen, you have to think it through.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m thinking very clearly,” Xiao Qishen turned to look at Xie Xun with unprecedented seriousness in his eyes. “Although I’ve never truly loved anyone, I’m serious this time. I don’t want to lose those people who have entered my heart because of some meaningless fame. True love doesn’t care about benefits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun looked at Xiao Qishen in a daze and suddenly cut him off. “Don’t use the lines that you’ve acted on to trick me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen suddenly changed into a smiling face. He didn’t look as serious as before. He sat on the sofa and said regretfully, “Ah, I was noticed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, my memory has improved a little.” Xie Xun used his hands to cover up his shock. Although it was a line and Xiao Qishen was laughing so hard, he could see how serious Xiao Qishen was when he said those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shan Yatong is a good artist, but he can’t be a good lover.” Xie Xun couldn’t bear to see the artist he has nurtured for four years fall into this trap. He sighed. “He likes to pretend. Such a person is cold-hearted and heartless. It’s unfortunate to fall in love with him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smile on Xiao Qishen’s face gradually faded. He looked at his fingertips. “Just like Jing Anjue, whom the media called the affectionate prince?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun didn’t expect that he would suddenly mention Jing Anjue. He was slightly taken aback, but in the end, he nodded helplessly. “Yes, just like Jing Anjue. He looks gentle to everyone, but inside, he’s colder than everyone else. No matter what, people can’t like him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t like Shan Yatong?” Xiao Qishen’s eyes narrowed. “Because he looks like Jing Anjue?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensing Xiao Qishen’s dissatisfaction, Xie Xun smiled wryly. “Although I don’t like it, I don’t hate it.” He looked at Xiao Qishen and said, “That’s because falling in love with someone like him will only cause people to crumble.” Just like Tang Ruanqing, Lin Yuxin, and Sha Xuexiang who had killed Jing Anjue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could still remember Tang Ruanqing’s abnormal mental state when he received the news of Jing Anjue’s death, as well as Lin Yuxin’s unprecedented haggardness and Sha Xuexiang’s wild laughter after being caught by the police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, the entertainment industry was in an unprecedented state of turmoil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yatong is not Jing Anjue.” Xiao Qishen stood up. “I’m not Sha Xuexiang either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun stroked his forehead and closed his eyes.” Maybe you’re not Sha Xuexiang.” However, he didn’t know if Yatong would be as cold as Jing Anjue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen could hear the hidden meaning in his words. He picked up the invitation card on the table and said, “I’m not Tang Ruanqing either. I love him and I will fight for him. I won’t let him become the second Jing Anjue. No matter how cold he is, I will warm up his heart.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun laughed. That’s right because the person before him wasn’t them, but Xiao Qishen. Perhaps, the ending wouldn’t be the same as before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps, someone would be happy.</span></p>
