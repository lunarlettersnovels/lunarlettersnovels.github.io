            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hero Saving the Beauty</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the memorial party, the artists went out to be interviewed by the media. When they mentioned their sorrows, they burst into tears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tang Ruanqing stood at the entrance, looking at the artists surrounded by the media. He remembered what Shan Yatong said and his face darkened. These artists did show up at the party, and most of them were veteran artists who have worked with Jing Anjue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chairman?” Zhang Feng, the assistant standing behind him, didn’t know what to say. He looked at the artists in front of him and didn’t know what to say also. As the chairman of an entertainment company, how could he not think of this? As long as there was a thread of opportunity to move up, this was a method known by those artists. Why should the president be angry because of this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A young man in white came out of the crowd in a hurry. When the media saw him, they crowded around him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shan Yatong?” Tang Ruanqing frowned. He wanted to see what he would say to the media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yatong, I’m from Yueyang Entertainment Weekly. What do you think of King Jingtian’s murder?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, Yatong. I’m a reporter from the Meiyue Daily. What do you think you have in common with King Jingtian?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, I’m…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong looked at the excited reporters and pushed aside the reporters in front. “Sorry, I’m not accepting interviews right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who knew that he just took a couple of steps, and would be surrounded again. His slender body was nearly engulfed by it. No one knew who hit him from the back, but Yatong was heavily struck by a camera. It was so painful that stars appeared before his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong hasn’t returned to his senses when the reporters swarmed him. He looked at the microphone in front of him. In his heart, he felt like giving the reporter in front of him a slap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chairman, things are starting not to look good,” Zhang Feng ordered the staff, frowning. “Call for security.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staff hurriedly took out his walkie-talkie. There was also noise coming from the other walkie-talkie. Once the staff heard it, his face changed; he turned to Zhang Feng and said, “Assistant Zhang, reporters are surrounding Luo Yanqian and Sister Lin. Security is over there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Send someone over immediately,” Tang Ruanqing said in a low voice. “Just tell them to protect Lin Yuxin. As for the people of Flying Entertainment, they can either handle it or they can’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staff paled. “Yes!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the white-robed youth’s pale face under the relentless attacks of the reporters, Zhang Feng worriedly said, “I’m worried something will happen if this continues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tang Ruanqing’s face was as dark as water, and he didn’t express his intentions. He just looked in the direction of Shan Yatong. He didn’t know if he was looking at Shan Yatong making a fool of himself or was worried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhang Feng could sense that Tang Ruanqing’s attitude towards Shan Yatong was unclear. He knew that this newcomer had somehow probably done something to make the chairman unhappy. He was afraid that this newcomer would have a difficult time in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yatong, please answer this question ……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong’s body was weak, to begin with, and he couldn’t stand still in this situation. He didn’t know where a force came from, but he fell forward with a bang. At this moment, Shan Yatong felt that even if there was negative news from the reporters, it would be better than this current situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t fall to the ground because someone held him by the waist. The constant sound of the shutter behind him indicated that the person supporting him was quite famous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone present, have you forgotten that today is King Jingtian’s memorial day? Under such circumstances, do you think it would be rude to do such a thing?” Xiao Qishen helped Shan Yatong up and impassively looked at the reporters in front of him, “As an entertainment media, it’s only natural to be friends with our artists. However, today’s situation is a little difficult for everyone. If our artists are injured in such a situation, how can everyone present explain it?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reporters looked at each other in dismay. Anyone could tell that Xiao Qishen was angry, and with Xiao Qishen’s identity there, no one dared to actually offend him. When they saw that Shan Yatong – who was being held by him – was pale and without a trace of blood, they finally realized that something was wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope that there will be no unforeseeable accidents. When the time comes, it’s not just the fans’ criticism that’ll be waiting for anyone, but also a subpoena from the court.” Xiao Qishen lowered his head and looked at his ashen face. “Yatong, how are you?” After he finished speaking, his gaze swept across the crowd in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the reporters saw his expression, they felt their hearts go cold. It seemed that Heavenly King Xiao was very dissatisfied with them this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn’t matter if they offended an ordinary artist, but offending Heavenly King Xiao wasn’t just offending the people in the entertainment industry. There was also the economically powerful Xiao Family. If Xiao Qishen insisted on pursuing this matter, they would receive a dismissal letter from their own television station or newspaper in less than three days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heavenly King Xiao, please forgive us. We weren’t careful.” An old reporter immediately apologized. Perhaps some newcomers felt that Heavenly King Xiao was acting like a Heavenly King, but many old reporters knew that the person in front of them could not be offended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, Linlang Weekly,” Xiao Qishen looked at the work badge on his chest and nodded, “I’ve agreed to your magazine’s invitation to shoot a cover photo. I’ll contact my manager tomorrow to arrange the time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Heavenly King Xiao.” The old reporter was overjoyed. In the past year, Xiao Qishen has rarely asked a magazine to shoot a cover photo. Now that he had agreed to it, not only because of the sales volume, it had also greatly raised the position of his magazine in the industry. He hurriedly thanked him and left with the reporters that were in the same company as him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen looked coldly at the reporters who didn’t dare to breathe. He supported Shan Yatong and said, “Let’s get into the car.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong nodded. He looked at the work badge that was pinned on the reporter’s chest: Meiyue Daily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reporter from Meiyue Daily shivered as he looked at the young man in white who had been helped into the car by Xiao Qishen. It was a big selling point for him to write about Heavenly King Xiao getting so mad that he turned blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s best if you don’t write about what happened tonight,” an old reporter from an editorial agency beside him glanced at him. “Now, you better pray that Mr. Shan doesn’t find out who hit him. Otherwise, you might never have the chance to be a reporter again in your life, let alone write a report.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why? We have our freedom of speech. Why should I not dare write about it?” He was a little dissatisfied. “Isn’t it just a Heavenly King? Why put on airs?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if you write it, the editor won’t be able to pass your report,” the old reporter didn’t want to continue persuading him and walked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he wasn’t angry, the expression on the old reporter’s face made him feel a little uneasy. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could it be that this Heavenly King Xiao really had so much face in the entertainment industry?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that Xiao Qishen and Shan Yatong have gotten into the car safely, Zhang Feng relaxed his stance. Fortunately, Xiao Qishen had made a move. Otherwise, the situation would have been chaotic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But… Zhang Feng was a little confused. In his memory, Xiao Qishen rarely changed his demeanor. In front of the media, he often maintained a friendly and warm expression. Today, his expression made him a bit unsettled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if it was because of King Jingtian’s memorial day, the reason why he was in a bad mood couldn’t be justified. This was because everyone in the Sky Crown knew that Heavenly King Xiao had no idea who Jing Anjue was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tang Ruanqing frowned and said to Zhang Feng, “Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Zimo, are you serious this time?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He hadn’t had much of a relationship with Xiao Zimo since he was young, and he didn’t like Xiao Zimo’s casual personality. Of course, Xiao Zimo didn’t like him either, but what he didn’t expect was that the always half-hearted Xiao Qishen would do this for Shan Yatong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was really surprising. He didn’t know if Xiao Zimo’s intentions toward Shan Yatong surprised him, or if Shan Yatong surprised him because of Xiao Zimo’s special feelings towards him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps it was both. Tang Ruanqing left his worries about Shan Yatong at the bottom of his heart and turned away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhang Feng glanced in the direction of the car, rubbed his nose, and followed behind Tang Ruanqing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen helped Shan Yatong into the car and said to the driver, “Drive now.” He tilted his head to look at Shan Yatong who was covering his head. “Are you hurt?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong touched the lump on his head and bared his teeth. “It’s alright. I was hit by a camera just now so it might be swollen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me have a look.” Xiao Qishen hugged Shan Yatong and placed his head on his chest. He carefully touched the bump on Shan Yatong’s head. “Fortunately, it’s not that serious. Let’s go to my place and apply it with some medicine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not that serious.” Shan Yatong didn’t like this position. He leaned back and said, “It’ll be gone within two days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person in his arms left him. The empty arms made Heavenly King Xiao feel a little disappointed. However, he didn’t dare do such a thing again. He had no guts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t. You still need medication,” Xiao Qishen said to the driver. “Old Li, drive straight to my villa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong glanced at him. When he thought of how this Heavenly King had helped him out, he didn’t reject his good intentions and just sent a message to Lu Fan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that Shan Yatong didn’t reject him, Xiao Qishen curled his lips. “What do you want to eat later? I’ll ask the chef in the villa to make it for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong yawned. “Anything will do.” He looked out the dark window. “I don’t really feel hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Look at how thin you are.” Xiao Qishen sighed. “That’s why you have to pay attention to your diet. What did your assistant do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong smiled. “He’s gone home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking of what happened to Shan Yatong today, Xiao Qishen’s brows furrowed. “Isn’t Lu Fan your manager? How did you end up in such a situation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong lowered his head slightly. “Perhaps because it’s Jing Anjue’s memorial day that he’s in a bad mood.” He raised his head and smiled. “Let’s not talk about this anymore. I’m a little sleepy. Wake me up when we have arrived.” After saying that, he closed his eyes and went to rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car became quiet again. Xiao Qishen looked at Shan Yatong’s pale face and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The night was still peaceful.</span></p>
