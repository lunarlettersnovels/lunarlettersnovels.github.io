            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Exciting Concert</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was half an hour before Xiao Qishen’s Shanghai concert. As soon as Shan Yatong got off the plane, the organizer sent a car to receive him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan and Shan Yatong got into the car. Shan Yatong’s expression was very calm. It was as if he wasn’t going to be a guest at the Heavenly King’s concert, but rather attend a fairly ordinary show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan didn’t know what Shan Yatong had said to Xiao Chengyu, but he didn’t encounter any retaliation from Xiao Chengyu today. He even sent people from the Xiao family to discuss the details of the promotion with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu was cold but merciless to those who offended him. Shan Yatong’s actions yesterday had long exceeded Xiao Chengyu’s bottom line. However, he was the second person who offended Xiao Chengyu but remained safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time they reached the concert venue, the concert had already started. However, there were still countless fans standing outside the venue who haven’t bought any tickets. They were holding various signs in their hands as they looked excitedly at the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the first time that Yatong had truly seen how popular Xiao Qishen was. This high-spirited scene wasn’t inferior to his previous life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound system outside the stadium was also filled with the liveliness of the stadium. Screams and bass drums could be heard, stimulating the crowd outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His[mfn]Yatong[/mfn] fingers couldn’t help but beat against his legs as the car slowly drove towards the backstage entrance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the staff saw Shan Yatong get out of the car, a group of people rushed over. The stylist and makeup artist hurriedly pulled him into the dressing room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A staff member stood beside him and said, “Mr. Shan, there are still 25 minutes before you go on stage. Please be prepared.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have 20 minutes, and it was in a middle of an interlude. Shan Yatong lowered his eyes and smiled. “I understand. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interlude was a time when the excited audience become weary. The appearance of a guest at this time was just enough to stimulate the audience’s nerves. It had to be said that this arrangement was very good, but if it continued to be stagnant, it would be highly disadvantageous to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun[mfn]Manager of Qishen[/mfn] or Xiao Qishen probably meant this. He closed his eyes and allowed the makeup artist to apply his eye shadows for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The series of makeup, hair modification, changing clothes, and matching them have already taken 20 minutes. There were still five minutes left before Shan Yatong could go on stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong was wearing a white casual suit. He looked like a handsome aristocrat. He followed behind the staff and stood upright, letting the people behind him ready him via hanging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His way of appearing was via hanging from the sky and dancing with Xiao Qishen. Then, he would sing, giving Xiao Qishen time to change his clothes. Then, he would perform another song with Xiao Qishen and say some nonsense. Then, he would sit on the moon that descended and leave the stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the timing wasn’t good for Shan Yatong, the way he would appear would definitely be eye-catching. Though the risk factor was a little higher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Counting down, 30, 29…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong adjusted his posture. After filming for so many years, he naturally knew what posture was better through hanging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“3……2……Down!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The music, the lights, and the white-robed youth who had suddenly descended from the sky. Everyone present saw a white shadow that appeared like a god. Only when the white shadow landed on the ground did they see who the person in front of them was. At that moment, screams once again soared in the arena.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen tilted his head to the side and smiled at the white-clothed youth who was three steps away from him. He didn’t introduce Shan Yatong and the live music had already been changed into a song from the HIGH[mfn]album[/mfn].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong quickly removed the route used from his body and danced with Xiao Qishen, screams resonating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen’s dance was tremendously energetic; every movement carried an element that could make one’s blood boil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beside him, Shan Yatong was a captivating and slender youth. His flawless maneuvers weren’t even inferior to the Heavenly King Xiao, who was adept at dancing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in the audience was boiling with excitement. They were all shouting till they became hoarse, yet they couldn’t help but scream for the people on the stage. How exciting was it to have such two perfect people standing on stage at the same time?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All they wanted to do now was scream and stare at the young man on stage. At the same time, they felt lucky that they were fortunate enough to see such an exciting performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dance ended and the lights dimmed. Only a beam of white light shined on Shan Yatong’s body. The audience gradually quieted down and the entire view was as quiet as the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of the zither was followed by a familiar melody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A huge still appeared on the big screen. The white-robed youth reached out to catch the falling peach blossoms with a lonely expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His voice was filled with melancholy. He led the crowd through the millennia to watch the love and hatred that began and ended sadly after a thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as everyone was about to wake up from the song, Xiao Qishen, who was dressed in a casual suit of the same style but not of the same color as Shan Yatong, appeared on stage. He looked at everyone on stage and smiled. “Yatong and I have been working together for a very long time. Everyone has seen Yatong and I filmed together, danced together, and sang together. Today is such a good day, so naturally, I won’t be singing alone. Thus, I invited my adorable junior brother to the venue to sing the theme song of my new album. Do you want to hear it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst everyone’s screams, Xiao Qishen looked at Shan Yatong with a smile. His eyes were filled with tenderness. “Yatong, I want you to sing this ‘Unspeakable Heart’ with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong placed his right hand in front of his chest and bowed. “It will be my honor, Your Highness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The faultless etiquette made the audience on stage scream again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gazes on stage were intertwined, but the atmosphere below the stage was warm. The scene of the two of them singing to each other made one feel indescribably comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screams, applause, singing, the scene was filled with excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Shan Yatong sat down on the moon and slowly rose, Xiao Qishen performed a magnificent gentleman’s salute, just like how he had done earlier. “Prince of the moon, I look forward to meeting you again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this scene, who knew how much camera film and phone memory have been wasted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, the reporters interviewed the audience and everyone was excited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A said: This was the most exciting concert I had ever seen, with a luxurious concert building and a passionate audience. It had to be said that this concert was remarkably successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B said: As expected of Heavenly King Xiao and Gongzi[mfn]Title of Shan Yatong[/mfn]. Whether it was the movies, songs, or dance moves, the two of them were a pleasant surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C said: You still have the nerve to ask such a question? How beautiful and eye-catching are the emperors and queens. What? No queen? Reporter, you’re a Martian, right? Your mother is taking you home for dinner in a spaceship. Go back quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D said: C was wrong. It was clearly a loyal dog and a queen. Well, a loyal dog and a seductress are also possible. What is a seductress? Wait! Go look for Du Niang[mfn]Alternative name for Baidu. It’s a platform similar to Google[/mfn]. I’ve never seen someone as ignorant as you, and you’re still a reporter. If you’re not harming the public, how could you not know about BALABALA[mfn]the raws used these exact words in it, should be a group name[/mfn] as a reporter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, the reporters kept talking about attacking and receiving[mfn]Gong &amp; Shou[/mfn].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of what the audience or the media said, in the end, the concert was an absolute success that it made the organizers laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Shan Yatong left the stage, he removed his makeup and hurriedly boarded the return flight. At most, he could sleep for four hours tonight. Tomorrow morning, he had to rush to shoot an advertisement for Xiao Corporation’s product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan asked the flight stewardess to bring him a glass of milk. He brought the milk to Shan Yatong and said, “You didn’t eat anything in the afternoon. Drink some milk first to nourish your stomach.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong covered the tiredness in his eyes and took a sip of the milk. He leaned against the back of the chair and closed his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan knew that Shan Yatong wasn’t asleep. He hesitated for a moment before he chose to speak. “What do you think of this concert?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong opened his eyes. Under the light of the plane, his dark eyes were as black as ink. “Very successful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan knew that he was telling the truth, so he continued, “You… Don’t you think your arrangements for this concert were too brilliant for you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a guest, he should be setting off the main character instead of stealing the audience’s attention. Xiao Qishen was a Heavenly King, so how could he not know? Then why was there such a plan?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong looked out the dark window and closed his eyes. “That was their arrangement. It has nothing to do with me.” He wasn’t a fool, so of course, he could see the problem. He just didn’t understand why Xiao Qishen would do such a thing that would be unfavorable to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Lu Fan in surprise. “Is this the power of the legendary friendship?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan pushed his glasses back and silently cursed in his heart. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friendship! I’ve only heard of this Penniless Priest’s friendship, but I’ve never seen such a self-sacrificing friendship? As for Xiao Qishen, who would do such a thing for friendship, he was either possessed by a ghost or his brain was kissed by a pig.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe,” A certain Lu Fan smiled. Although he kept grumbling in his heart, as a gold-rank manager, he still maintained his gentle and refined image, “Usually, Heavenly King Xiao would always take care of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yadong glanced at him lazily and stuffed the milk cup into his hand. “I’ll sleep for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the ample cup of milk left in his hand, Lu Fan nudged his nose. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how mature he appeared to be, didn’t he look like a child who hated milk?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the car, Xie Xun and Xiao Qishen were both sitting in the back seat. Xie Xun lamented, “Shan Yatong will definitely be very red[mfn]Popular[/mfn].” He had been observing Shan Yatong’s performance on stage. There was a typhoon that was so marvelous that it was a little surprising. Under the screams of tens of thousands of audience members, he was especially calm “He’s red now,” Xiao Qishen yawned and said casually, “His strength is here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun smiled. “What’s the point of having the strength or luck in this industry?” He looked out of the car window and didn’t let Xiao Qishen see the worry in his eyes, “You were the one who recommended Shan Yatong to Lin Yiqian for ‘Lincheng’. In front of the media and the company, you were protecting him with a discreet method. Even the reason you agreed to play ‘Millennium’ was because of Shan Yatong. You’ve done so much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen’s lips curled into a smile. “Ah, but you do understand why I did this, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun retracted his gaze and said weakly, “But you guys are artists.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen sneered. “This kind of thing has never been a roadblock for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun opened his mouth but was unable to say a single word. This person had always recognized one thing and never regretted it. No one could change it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because he wasn’t just Xiao Qishen from the entertainment industry, he was also the young master of the Xiao family, Xiao Zimo.</span></p>
