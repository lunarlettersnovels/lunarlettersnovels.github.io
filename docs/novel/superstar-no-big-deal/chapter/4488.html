<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why would I join this program with you?” Xiao Qishen smiled and explained, “Because I’ve also been invited to this show. Plus, I don’t have any other plans for tonight, so it’s very interesting to join the show with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan snorted coldly, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">flattering him! Who cares!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun’s tears streamed down his face. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve pushed so many announcements, yet you’re saying that there’s nothing wrong?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they arrived at a Chinese restaurant, the two managers didn’t feel that there was anything wrong with being a light bulb[mfn]Third wheel[/mfn]. They just sat between the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yatong came to pick me up today. I feel very grateful…Thank you.” Xiao Qishen was almost touched. He pushed the menu to Shan Yatong. “If you like it, just order it.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labour wasn’t a person. Why didn’t you thank me for coming to pick you up?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Wait!” Lu Fan cursed inwardly. He smiled and pushed his glasses.”Yatong, I like crabs and bamboo shoots.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun bluntly said, “I’ve been walking a lot lately. I’ll just order something for mending legs and tendons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After their meal, it was already past 6 o’clock. There was still an hour before the show started. The two agents dutifully sent the two of them to the television station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he had just gotten off the plane, Xiao Qishen didn’t use his own makeup artist. He leaned against the soft chair and allowed the makeup artist to wipe off his face. He closed his eyes and listened to the conversation between the makeup artist and Shan Yatong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yatong’s skin is very good. What do you use to maintain it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An international brand was given by a friend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen was extremely pleased with himself. He had given a set of skincare products to Shan Yatong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really like your song. It’s very nice. I was about to cry when I heard ‘Millennium’. I felt really sad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This kind of ingratiating method was too clumsy, and Xiao Qishen looked down on this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The makeup artist didn’t dare say anything. She looked at Heavenly King Xiao, who was resting with his eyes closed, and sighed. He was indeed a Heavenly King. No matter what he looked like, he was always a stunner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Entertainment Face-to-Face” was a talk show. The host was also a gold-medal host in the industry. All of his shows were filled with big-shot artists. At the same time, he wouldn’t act like those other hosts, but even so, his show’s viewership ratings were still high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the viewers said that the artists on this show were more realistic. They liked this show because of its depth and rationality. It wasn’t as noisy as the other shows. It didn’t rely on ridiculous gimmicks. It wasn’t like the ridiculous M-TV station that liked to shoot shocking TV dramas and also liked to create incomprehensible gossip. They always liked to create gimmicks. It was interesting at the start, but it made people feel disgusted after a long time. Did they think that the viewers were idiots? The most hateful thing was that they always liked to insert and broadcast some shocking TV series in commercials. Many viewers said that the television station — </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kills unnoticeably.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the show started, the scene was incredibly warm. Shan Yatong and Xiao Qishen were sitting on the sofa. There was a glass coffee table in front of them with two glasses of juice on it. Wang Xin, who was over 40 years old, sat in their upper right corner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good evening, my friends from the audience.” Wang Xin didn’t have a script in his hand. He naturally introduced the guests to the audience. They exchanged pleasantries before entering the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This question might just be troubling Yatong.” Wang Xin’s smile was very gentle. “Many media outlets claimed that Shan Yatong is not popular, so this is quite a shock. What do you think of this question?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How can it be popular if it’s not amazing?” Shan Yatong said with a smile, “This is inevitable. This is my opinion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a brilliant idea,” Wang Xin nodded. “Speaking of which, I heard a piece of news that Heavenly King Xiao took over a gay film. If it’s true, I think the audience would like to know why you did it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To me, love is love, regardless of gender,” Xiao Qishen thoughtfully responded. “Miss Liao Ran’s script was particularly appealing, and the love in it was also very touching. I like the intention in it. It has nothing to do with whether it’s gay or not. Love is love. Does love have to be different?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It looks like this script is indeed a rare masterpiece,” Wang Xin sighed. “However, not a single one of Liao Ran’s scripts is a masterpiece.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Previously, Yatong was called homosexual because of a scandal. Your views are very similar to Heavenly King Xiao’s. As expected of a junior brother. Since Yatong entered the Sky Crown, he has worked with Heavenly King Xiao the most. What do you think of Heavenly King Xiao?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Brother Xiao isn’t my manager,” Shan Yatong teased. “Brother Xiao takes care of me very much. He’s never acted like a Superstar and is easy to get along with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After asking a few questions that weren’t considered personal, the three of them started talking about fruits from the economy to the Auntie next door. The atmosphere at the scene was quite pleasant, and Wang Xin was impressive at taking care of the two of them. He didn’t want Shan Yatong to think that the host only valued Superstars and didn’t care about him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the show ended, Wang Xin sighed as he watched the two of them leave together. He didn’t realize that Xiao Qishen had, intentionally or unintentionally, made Shan Yatong stand out. When Xiao Qishen had taken the initiative to participate in his show, he knew that Xiao Qishen had a lot of feelings for him[mfn]Shan Yatong[/mfn].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he could tell that Shan Yatong wasn’t gay. Even if Xiao Qishen succeeded, it would still be hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behaving this way with no complaints, Wang Xing just hoped that he[mfn]Qishen[/mfn] would have no regrets about the outcome.</span></p>
