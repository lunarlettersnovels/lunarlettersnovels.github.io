<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Shan Yatong returned home in Xiao Qishen’s car. When he left, he didn’t notice the gaze of an old man sitting on the sofa. Perhaps as an artist, he was already used to the gaze of others, so this gaze didn’t interest him at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the name of the person that Zimo has been following tonight?” Xiao Youtian held the dragon head on his walking stick; his eyes like a sharp blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Master, that’s an artist from the same entertainment company as the second young master. He’s also the spokesperson for our company’s new fashion watch.” A middle-aged man beside him replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Artist…” Xiao Youtian stood up and said, “Go back to the old residence and have someone send me this person’s information by 11 tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.” The middle-aged man followed behind the old man respectfully. He took out his phone and instructed his subordinates in a low voice. Then, he guarded his surroundings until the old man got into the car. He didn’t let his guard down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning to the Xiao family’s old residence, Xiao Youtian glanced at Xiao Chengyu who was sitting in the living room. He didn’t say anything and went upstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu watched the old man go upstairs, and the empty hall became quiet again. He looked at the big bell on the wall, and the beating of the bell hurt his heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, even though he had shared a flat with someone else, it was more comfortable than this magnificent mansion. At least at that time, there was him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he thought of all the good things that had happened in the past, his usually cold face was suddenly filled with warmth. However, the ear-piercing sound of high heels interrupted his memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He turned around in displeasure. “What are you doing down here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Jing smiled bitterly. “It’s very late. Go to bed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You go to bed first. I still have some things to attend to. I’ll go to the study room later.” Xiao Chengyu forced down the impatience in his heart. A smile appeared on his face, but it was very far-fetched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yu Family’s Miss was chosen by him because Yu Jing was the only daughter of the Yu Family. He admitted that he and Yu Jing were together more to consolidate his strength in the Xiao Family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had already lost everything. He couldn’t lose the Xiao family’s inheritance rights anymore, and the Xiao family’s property couldn’t be given to a homosexual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although others didn’t know, he knew that Xiao Zimo was a homosexual. As long as Elder Xiao didn’t know about his situation in California, everything would be fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suddenly thought of the artist who knew about his past and frowned. He had to keep this a secret and not let anything happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yu Jing lowered her head and looked at her husband’s distant gaze as she went upstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu didn’t look at her again. He sat on the sofa and listened blankly to the sound of the clock moving. So when he was called “Young Master”, he looked at the person in front of him with surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This person was a subordinate of Grandfather. Looking at the large file bag in his hand, he asked casually, “What do you have there?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the information about an artist. Master is still waiting upstairs. Excuse me.” Although the person’s attitude was polite, Xiao Chengyu felt that this person was looking down on him. He looked at the person’s back and narrowed his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days have passed since Luo Yanqian’s birthday. It was the press conference for ‘Millennium’. There was still an hour before the press conference. The entire venue was filled with reporters. The late-comers could only find their own places to stand. At least they could take two photos and dig up some news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Millennium” was the only film in the country that was based on same-sex love with a fantasy theme. It was composed of famous writers, directors, and superstars. Even some of the monsters were famous big shots in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the thousand-year-old Ginseng Demon was played by the famous veteran artist Li Aihua, and the one-shot Little Flower Demon was also played by the most popular idol actress. In general, the characters in this movie were people who could be talked about in the industry, and the main character was the superstar Xiao Qishen. The popular artist Luo Yanqian was actually playing the number two male role in this movie, causing the artists, who were present, to wonder who the other male lead was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were various speculations. There were even votes on the official website. There were all sorts of speculations. Almost all of the popular A-listers were nominated by netizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some of the Truth Lords mentioned a name, Shan Yatong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their reason was that Shan Yatong’s interaction with Xiao Qishen in ‘Lin Cheng’ was filled with a forbidden love between brothers, and in the end, he sacrificed himself for his brother’s happiness. How could this kind of relationship be an ordinary brotherly relationship? This must be JQ, a strong JQ[mfn]JQ means they have a suspicious relationship as if they were having a same-sex love affair[/mfn], and the two of them were a perfect match for each other in the concert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it didn’t take long for someone to retort. The reason for the rebuttal was that although Shan Yatong was indeed popular and had worked with Xiao Qishen quite a bit, Li Nan was an internationally renowned director. How could he allow a newly-famous artist to play such an important role? Besides, Heavenly King Xiao was so perfect, how could he belong to a single person? He was everyone’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quarrels between the two groups continued, so in the end, both parties said that the news would be revealed at the press conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This press conference had received the attention of all parties. By the time the press conference started, the entire hall was already filled with reporters from the new media. Some unlucky reporters didn’t even have a chance to squeeze in.</span></p>
