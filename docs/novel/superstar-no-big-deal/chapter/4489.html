                Chapter 55 - Arrival at the Airport (1)

        </header>

        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Arrival at the Airport</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the sun sets, the sky was dyed red, as if it was about to burn out all the light. It was so dazzling that people couldn’t help but look away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a day of filming, Shan Yatong sat in the car and was playing a game. Lu Fan, who was sitting next to him, closed his phone and said hesitantly, “Xiao Qishen has already gotten off the plane.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the GAMEOVER on the phone screen, Shan Yatong blankly raised his head and asked, “What?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan glanced at Shan Yatong’s cell phone. He sighed in his heart. He honestly didn’t realize that one could be GAMEOVER quickly in this type of game. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would he be playing it with such interest?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Xie Xun said that Xiao Qishen really wants to… Let’s go pick him up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pick him up?” Shan Yatong put away his phone. “I’m not going. There might be a large group of reporters squatting in the airport right now. Why would I cause trouble for myself?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Xiao Qishen’s trip this time hasn’t been made public, so the media had no idea that Xiao Qishen has already arrived at the airport.” Lu Fan no longer ask Shan Yatong about it and instructed the driver, “To the airport.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring him, Shan Yatong took out his phone and played Tetris. He understood what Lu Fan meant. At present, Xiao Qishen was a superstar. It would be ideal for Shan Yatong to have a harmonious relationship with him. As for why Xiao Qishen was absolutely good to him, this was not within his scope of consideration. After all, that person would definitely tell him his goal in the end. Ultimately, there was no reason for this world to be good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game ended up once again with a GAMEOVER. Shan Yatong looked up at the sky and found that the sky in the west was as red as a fire. Suddenly, he remembered a rather artistic phrase: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The setting sun was like blood.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan turned his head and saw the youth’s face that became red from the sunset. This face, bathed in the setting sun, was especially gentle. But it was also this gentle face that hid all of his emotions under a smile. Seeing this youth, Lu Fan would always think of Jing Anjue. No matter what, he couldn’t change this habit. Perhaps it was because he looked too much like that person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lu Fan, why are you holding a memorial party for King Jingtian this year?” Shan Yatong was puzzled, “This year shouldn’t be a special day, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan recalled his thoughts, “Because this year is Jing Anjue’s 13th year in Sky Crown.” He played with the phone in his hand, and his voice was indescribably calm. “Jing Anjue’s favorite number was also 13.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An unlucky number in the eyes of the Westerners?” Shan Yatong looked at Lu Fan and raised an eyebrow, “What a strange hobby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan laughed, “I thought you said you had personality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong raised his eyebrows and didn’t say anything. He continued to play his game on his phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long after, the driver’s voice broke the silence in the car, “We’re here at the airport.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan said to Shan Yatong, “Remain seated in the car. I’ll go pick them up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan just got off the car with only a few steps before he saw Xie Xun and Xiao Qishen. He walked in front of them and glanced at the modestly dressed Xiao Qishen. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen saw that he was alone. His eyes darkened, but he only blinked. He put his hands in his pockets and asked, “Did Yatong’s filming not go well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan walked in front and didn’t even look back. “It went well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen’s heart trembled. “Then what is he doing now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan turned around and glanced at him. “He’s resting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen felt his heart twitch. “Was he tired from today’s work?” Otherwise, why didn’t he come to pick him up?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The workload today was very light.” Lu Fan pushed his glasses. “Yatong’s performance was remarkably good. Perhaps everyone except for Xiao Chengyu was immensely satisfied.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workload was very light yet he was very unwilling to pick him up. He[mfn]Xiao Qishen[/mfn] felt like his heart and liver were all jumping and dancing. As the owner of this body, he felt powerless. He waved his hand. “Xiao Chengyu can ignore it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun, who had been silent the entire time, looked at Xiao Qishen sympathetically. “I heard that Yatong will be participating in a local television station tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan nodded. “It’s called Entertainment Face-to-Face. What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun rubbed his nose. “What? Qishen will also participate in this program tonight, so you must remember to tell Yatong to mentally prepare himself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan pushed his glasses to hide the killing intent in his eyes. Xiao Qishen was a dead man. If he wasn’t the Heavenly King, he would have had to let this man leave Shan Yatong’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I will.” Lu Fan led the two of them to put their luggage in the trunk and turned around. “Yatong is very adaptable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the window rolled down and a head popped out. “Brother Xiao, Brother Xie, get in the car quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yatong?!” Xiao Qishen suddenly understood the meaning of the word “Unexpected happiness”. He threw the luggage in his hand and quickly opened the door to sit inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh~” Xie Xun hugged his foot. “Xiao Qishen, that was my foot!” Unfortunately, the other party ignored him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan pushed his glasses and smiled at the luggage that was thrown to the ground. He picked it up and put it in the trunk. He patted his shoulder sympathetically and said, “Rest in peace!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rest in peace!” Xie Xun sneered and said, “Why don’t you give it a try.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, the artist under my name is Shan Yatong, not Xiao Qishen,” Lu Fan smiled as he opened the car door and entered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn!” Mary was separated from him[mfn]Slang for ‘What the fuck’[/mfn]. Why was he so unlucky? He opened the passenger door and sat down. Xie Xun snorted, “You can drive now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yatong, have you had dinner?” Xiao Qishen asked with a smile while Shan Yatong shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen happily said, “Then we’ll go have dinner together, and then we’ll go to the program together. I know a great Chinese restaurant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan gritted his teeth. If he didn’t do anything, he would be a traitor.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xie Xun was a disdain, dog!</span></i></p>
