        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong> Birthday Dinner</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only son of the Luo family held his birthday party. Naturally, there would be a lot of people in the entertainment field. Some bureau chiefs, some directors, and some ministers have come to honor him. This was naturally not to give a face to Luo Yanqian, but to his father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luo Hua and his wife, Xian Pei, were mingling around in the crowd. Although Xian Pei wasn’t Luo Yanqian’s biological mother, they have gotten along well over the past 10 years. Although there was no warmth between mother and son, it could at least be regarded as peaceful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xian Pei could tell that Luo Yanqian was behaving absentmindedly tonight. She held her glass and walked gracefully to Luo Yanqian’s side. She asked in a low voice, “An, is there anything you’re unhappy about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luo Yanqian looked at the woman in front of him with her delicate makeup and shook his head. “It’s nothing. I’m just a little tired.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You,” Xian Pei said helplessly, “I really don’t understand why you want to be an artist. You’re losing a lot of weight every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luo Yanqian lowered his head and didn’t say anything. He just looked at the champagne in his glass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xian Pei knew that enough was enough. That was all she could do. She smiled and changed the topic. “Let’s go. Elder Xiao is here too. This is a rare opportunity. Go over and greet him now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luo Yanqian glanced at the door. Shan Yatong hadn’t come yet. He hid his disappointment and took a sip of champagne. He said bitterly, “Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xian Pei noticed his actions. She thought that he was waiting for someone, but they hadn’t come. It seemed that An valued this person very much. However, she didn’t know who could let An – who didn’t like to befriend much – show such an expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A black Lincoln car stopped outside the door of the Luo family. The guards knew that the person who came here was a big shot, so they didn’t dare to neglect him. They rushed forward to look at the invitation card and respectfully opened the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong, who was sitting in the passenger seat, glanced at the fawning expressions of the guards. “Say, if I drive that BMW that the company has allocated to me, how would these people behave like?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen stopped the car just in time. When he heard Shan Yatong’s words, he smiled and said, “A BMW isn’t bad either, but I’m afraid these people aren’t that fawning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong opened the car door and glanced at the 13th-class Lincoln. He was seriously considering whether he wanted to buy a more advanced car.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Men just like cars, right?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, are you thinking about buying a car?” Xiao Qishen closed the car door and asked teasingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong wasn’t annoyed by the speculation. He glanced at Xiao Qishen and said, “Just thinking about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had earned a lot more money in Sky Crown than with the previous owner of this body in Flying Entertainment. But compared to his previous life, this money was indeed not enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking of this, Shan Yatong had to admit that he was still a poor man. He adjusted the accessories on his evening suit. It seemed that it was too painful to have without money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen saw that he didn’t say anything and thought he was angry. He quickly smiled at Shan Yatong and said, “Then, why don’t we go in first? The banquet has already started.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong looked at the inexplicable smile on Xiao Qishen’s face. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was this guy possessed?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He listened to the music in the hall and nodded. “Let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen heaved a sigh of relief. It didn’t look like he was angry. It was alright, it was alright.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong took two steps and stopped. He turned to look at a certain Heavenly King, with a smile on his face and his eyebrows raised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen immediately understood. He hurriedly walked forward. With his and Shan Yatong’s current identities, if Shan Yatong walked ahead of him, he would be in trouble tomorrow. After all, there might be a reporter hiding at this banquet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there were many people at the banquet, it didn’t seem noisy. The noble ladies maintained a good upbringing and talked about jewelry and clothes. Their tone was just right. They weren’t arrogant and didn’t appear to have lost their identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The men were all polite to each other. While being careful that no one would find out about their company, they tried their best to get any information from others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upper-class banquets weren’t just drinking and dancing like in the TV series. They were more about hidden battles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen’s arrival immediately attracted the attention of the surrounding people. Although everyone knew that the second son of the Xiao family was in the entertainment industry, everyone knew that the old man liked this second grandson; not the current President of the Xiao family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu might appear to be the President of the Xiao family, but as long as Old Patriarch Xiao didn’t die, he would always be a nominal President.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very soon, someone came up to greet them. It wasn’t obvious that he was trying to curry favor with them, but it wasn’t also deliberately respectful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment he entered the banquet, Xiao Qishen was already the second son of the Xiao family, Xiao Zimo. His words and actions represented the Xiao family; not the entertainment industry’s Heavenly King Xiao.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong looked at Xiao Qishen and shook the champagne in his glass. He was about to leave when he stopped in his tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yatong.” The smile on Luo Yanqian’s face was obvious. He strode over to Shan Yatong’s side. “I thought you wouldn’t be here today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong smiled. “No, I was a bit late because we just finished filming an advertisement. Please forgive me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s good that you’re here.” Realizing that his words seemed to be explicit, Luo Yanqian awkwardly coughed. “Was it the advertisement for the Xiao family’s watch?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mm,” Shan Yatong’s eyes flashed with ridicule, “Eldest Young Master Xiao has said that this advertisement isn’t good. I can’t even think about living in the entertainment industry. How could I not work hard on such a big threat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who the hell does he think he is? His birth mother is just the daughter of a servant of the Xiao family. He really thinks he’s someone important.” Luo Yanqian disdainfully snorted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people of the upper class attached great importance to his birth. Xiao Chengyu’s indifference had something to do with his birth, and Old Master Xiao didn’t like him. His mother was also a big reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong concealed the smile on his face. “This is your birthday party.” He glanced around and saw Xiao Chengyu. The man indifferently pushed away from the woman he was talking to. This woman was his wife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t have to worry about his threat.” Although Luo Yanqian was a little unwilling, he still said, “He isn’t the only heir to the Xiao family. Xiao Qishen won’t let you be bullied.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong only smiled. He never believed that anyone could protect anyone. When a person was in trouble, the first thing they thought of was not to help others but to help themselves. If they didn’t know this, even if they weren’t in the entertainment industry, they wouldn’t have gone far. Even if he believed that Xiao Qishen would really help him, he didn’t want Xiao Qishen to be his last shield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Xiao Qishen sent away the last person who showed his goodwill, he searched around for Shan Yatong’s figure. In the end, he saw that Shan Yatong and Luo Yanqian were talking about something. They seemed to be in a good mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen felt wronged and sad. He walked to Shan Yatong’s side and changed his previous tact. “Yatong, why did you disappear in a blink of an eye?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tone…Luo Yanqian tightened his grip on his glass. He felt a little uncomfortable. “Mr. Xiao, I’m really honored for you to be able to attend my birthday banquet today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. Today, Yatong said he would come here, so I’ll be accompanying Yatong.” The meaning behind his words was that he didn’t want to do this. This young master came because of Shan Yatong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luo Yanqian obediently turned to Shan Yatong and said, “Yatong, thank you very much. If Mr. Xiao is busy next time, I don’t want him to be delayed because of these trivial matters. I will feel bad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong took a sip of champagne and listened to their conversation with a smile. He didn’t say anything, but the smell of gunpowder between the two made him interested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them seemed to feel that something was wrong as soon as they met. Could it be that it was as he guessed, these two were love rivals? However, he was so close to Xiao Qishen that he didn’t see him being very close to any woman except for Lin Yuxin… But, the person Lin Yuxin liked was… Moreover, Xiao Qishen didn’t have a crush on Lin Yuxin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suddenly remembered that Luo Yanqian and Lin Yuxin have been stuck in the same place because of the reporters. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could it be… Luo Yanqian liked Lin Yuxin?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being struck by his speculation, Shan Yatong retracted his thoughts and heard the polite conversation between Xiao Qishen and Luo Yanqian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How can I compare to Heavenly King Xiao? This month, there have already been several scandals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Luo, you don’t have to belittle yourself. You have a lot of scandals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right, I heard that Heavenly King Xiao’s album has been put off repeatedly. Don’t let anything unexpected happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Luo doesn’t need to worry about this. I heard that Mr. Luo’s filming this time doesn’t have a good viewership rating. Do you want me to help promote it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong narrowed his eyes and looked at the man approaching. The champagne in his glass swayed. “President Xiao.” His smile was cold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this person, Xiao Qishen and Luo Yanqian didn’t make any more noise. They stood beside Shan Yatong as if Xiao Chengyu was rude to him and they were about to throw him out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu could clearly see the coldness in Shan Yatong’s eyes. He wasn’t imagining it, Shan Yatong really didn’t like him from the very beginning. From the very start, he had been rude and ridiculing him. But in his memory, he didn’t know this youth at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu stopped and didn’t continue walking. He raised his glass to the three of them and turned to leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph!” Luo Yanqian harrumphed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chi!” Xiao Qishen sneered, but he raised his glass to Xiao Chengyu’s back and took a sip of champagne.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong looked at Xiao Chengyu’s back with a perfect smile on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luo Yanqian and Xiao Qishen exchanged glances. Luo Yanqian was confused and Xiao Qishen was determined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen was determined about his love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luo Yanqian couldn’t understand Xiao Qishen’s feelings for Shan Yatong or his feelings for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who knew? In this flashy industry, he still couldn’t find what he wanted. Perhaps it would be too late when he understood.</span></p>
