            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Advertisement</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concert’s response was exceptionally good. The number of reports about Shan Yatong in the entertainment news was increasing, and Gongzi’s title was getting louder and louder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this wasn’t Shan Yatong’s concern. He had arrived at the Xiao Family’s commercial shooting venue and the equipment have been set up. However, some people shouldn’t have come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked at the aloof man sitting under the umbrella and sneered. He sat in the lounge chair, waiting for the shoot to start. He flipped through the advertising ideas in his hands, highlighting elegance and nobility. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will this product go up the consumption line?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[mfn]Targeting the rich people[/mfn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Xiao Family was involved in various industries namely: real estate, clothes, daily necessities, cosmetics, and the food industry. And today, he was endorsing a men’s style watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had seen the samples of those watches before. There was a kind of low-key luxury. It was very suitable for high-level men to wear. Once it hit the market, the response should be pretty good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the manager saw Shan Yatong sitting quietly on the side, he quickly approached him with a smile and took out a few photos of him. “Mr. Shan, all my sisters like you very much, can you sign these for me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong closed the advertisement script in his hand and smiled as he looked up. He took the photo from the manager. “I’m genuinely grateful for their love. Please express my thanks to them on my behalf.” As he spoke, he lowered his head and signed them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhao Ling saw someone asking for Shan Yatong’s autograph from afar. She was a little jealous. She also wanted to get an autograph. As for the boss’s cold face, she chose to ignore it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu didn’t like this young man. He knew very well that he rarely had this kind of direct emotion over the years, either because of his previous provocation or because of what he had said in front of the elevator.</span></p>
<p><b><i>I didn’t expect you to get married when you’re gay.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The youth spoke with such certainty as if he had seen through the darkness of his heart. He was like a frog that was examined by a snake, sticky and distressing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had never thought that he was gay, except that the person he had once liked was a man. Moreover, that person was already a dead person, and Shan Yatong’s understanding of him made him uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did he look at him like that? Was it contempt or disgust?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What qualifications did a small artist have? Could it be that he didn’t know that Tang Ruanqing had been giving him a big red light[mfn]Notifying Shan Yatong of the big projects even though he is a small artist[/mfn] all this time? It was just something that he gained through unspoken means.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, he took some photos. Shan Yatong’s posture was impressively good, and he couldn’t let go at all. The cameraman patted his camera; he praised in his heart that this rookie transformed so quickly that he wasn’t like a newcomer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he finished filming, Shan Yatong sat on the side and quietly asked the makeup artist to fix his makeup. Today, he would only take two shots, and the rest would be taken tomorrow. When he thought of the memorial party tomorrow night, he sighed in his heart. He was already dead, so he didn’t mind doing this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it has been only four years, not ten. He really couldn’t understand why the gala was excessively grand. This wasn’t a special day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Could it be that Sky Crown was going to make a collection of the songs he used to sing and sell them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the makeup artist was about to put on the makeup, Lu Fan walked over with his phone. “Yatong, Xiao Qishen called you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong raised his eyebrows and took his phone. He leaned against the back of the chair and yawned. “Hello, this is Shan Yatong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yatong, did the filming go smoothly?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, it’s okay.” He closed his eyes to rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mm… Did Xiao Chengyu trouble you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He glanced at the man sitting in the distance, flipping through the documents. Shan Yatong continued to rest. “No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright then. I still have an announcement to make. I’ll be at the airport at 5 PM today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I understand.” Shan Yatong closed the phone and raised an eyebrow. Why did this brother call him? Was he worried that he would be bullied by his brother?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Qishen listened to the beeping sound on his phone and knew that he had already hung up. He unwillingly sighed. That person didn’t even want to pick him up. He threw his phone on the cushion beside him and Xiao Qishen closed his eyes. He didn’t believe that he couldn’t deal with a brat who was several years younger than him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a pity that a certain Heavenly King had forgotten one reason, that was: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoever falls in love first, loses</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong passed the phone to Lu Fan and continued to rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan put his phone into his pocket with a calm expression. He pushed his glasses that didn’t show any signs of slipping. “Tonight, you’re going to participate in a live broadcast of an entertainment program from a local television station. The time is 7:40 p.m.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong nodded in understanding and covered his face with the script.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an unknown period, when Shan Yatong was in a daze, he felt that someone was standing beside him. However, since he had no intention to speak, he didn’t bother to open his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“President, the President of DeRui just called to discuss the land issue in the Eastern City.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only then did Shan Yatong know that the person standing beside him was Xiao Chengyu. He opened his eyes and saw Xiao Chengyu and his assistant standing three steps away from him. The female assistant kept glancing at him from the corner of her eye. Shan Yatong smiled and nodded at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu also seemed to notice that something was wrong with his female assistant. He turned his head and saw that the person who had just fallen asleep has opened his eyes. He said to Zhao Ling, “Tell him what you need to talk about tonight. Go back to the company first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhao Ling felt that something was wrong. She looked at Shan Yatong, nodded, and left. She only dared to turn her head after she had walked farther. She only saw Xiao Chengyu sitting next to Shan Yatong, not knowing what to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She furrowed her brows slightly. To some extent, she understood Xiao Chengyu’s personality. It was rare for him to have a pleasant look on his face. Although he was the President of the Xiao family, he wasn’t liked by the old man. In comparison, the old man seemed to like Second Young Master Xiao a little more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His disdain for Shan Yatong’s identity as an artist was mostly because he was mocking Second Young Master Xiao. She couldn’t understand the aristocratic families, but the only thing she could see was that the President and Heavenly King Xiao weren’t compatible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it was a bit surprising that the president shouldn’t have said that because he had misjudged his personality. Even though he was the President of the Xiao Clan, Shan Yatong still wouldn’t swallow his anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhao Ling liked Shan Yatong very much. After what happened yesterday, she liked him even more. As an artist, Shan Yatong has indeed a strong-willed personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What exactly do you want?” Xiao Chengyu looked at the person lazily leaning against his seat and spoke coldly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shan Yatong smiled. “President Xiao, please don’t use that tone to talk to me. I’m a man. What can I do to you? You’re not a beauty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu’s face turned even colder. He looked sharply at Shan Yatong. “What did you mean by what you said yesterday?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yesterday?” Shan Yatong sat up straight and flipped through the script in his hand. He didn’t even raise his head and said, “I said a lot of things yesterday. Which one were you asking?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shan Yatong, you better not anger me!” Xiao Chengyu’s face was chilling. “I’m not Tang Ruanqing. I won’t indulge in your personality of not knowing the enormity of heaven and earth[mfn]Yatong’s arrogance[/mfn].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So… President Xiao is threatening me?” Shan Yatong looked up with a mocking smile. “Is that what you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu didn’t say anything. Shan Yatong narrowed his eyes. “It’s fine. You can do whatever you want. At most, I’ll lose my identity as an artist. If you’re willing to lose the Xiao family’s inheritance, it’s a good deal, isn’t it?” Shan Yatong smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu looked at the young man before him. He had already obtained all the information about this person last night. He was born in an orphanage. During the time he was at Flying Entertainment, his personality was weak and he was plagued by negative rumors. After he was transferred to Sky Crown Entertainment, he became famous overnight. His album was sold, the media have given him a lot of praise, and he was even addressed as Gongzi[mfn]Young Master[/mfn]. His personality had also changed greatly. His singing and acting skills were both well-received by the industry. These two images formed a sharp contrast. It made one doubt that Shan Yatong’s previous performance in Flying Entertainment was intentional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although it’s good to have a character as an artist, it’s annoying to have too much personality,” Xiao Chengyu stood up. “You better be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Chengyu had just walked two steps when he heard the young man’s clear and shallow voice, even a smile could be hinted at. “Not everyone cares about an artist’s identity. President Xiao, what you see is sometimes not credible. Sometimes, if you meet a cat by the side of the road, it might also be a tiger. If you do something wrong, you have to reflect. Who knows if there is such a thing as retribution in this world, right, President Xiao?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His footsteps slightly paused. He concealed the fear in his heart and continued to walk forward. He had to leave this young man now because his gaze could evoke uncomfortable feelings of being able to see through people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under a large tree, Lu Fan looked at Xiao Chengyu’s back with a complicated expression. He wasn’t sure what Shan Yatong and Xiao Chengyu have discussed, but he could see that there was something wrong between the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back then, Jing Anjue had the same attitude towards Xiao Chengyu. Although he didn’t know what happened between Jing Anjue and Xiao Chengyu, he knew that the two of them knew each other before Jing Anjue had his debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jing Anjue debuted at the age of 22. Before he debuted, he went and studied in California in the United States. However, he didn’t complete his studies and returned to China. In less than 10 years since he debuted, he was already a superstar in the entertainment industry. In the past 10 years, he had never cooperated with the Xiao Family. Even if the Xiao Family’s executives personally invited him, Jing Anjue had never given them a good face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He still remembered a time when Xiao Chengyu personally invited Jing Anjue. Jing Anjue said, “When you go out, turn left. The elevator is there. Thank you for your cooperation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the first time he had seen Jing Anjue reject a product endorsement so bluntly. After the incident, he had asked why, but Jing Anjue only replied, “Seeing that person was in a bad mood, I didn’t hit him because I had a good upbringing.” From then on, he knew that Jing Anjue hated Xiao Chengyu, but he didn’t dare continue asking. His intuition told him that it wouldn’t be good for him to ask further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Jing Anjue didn’t like Xiao Chengyu for a reason, then where did Shan Yatong’s dislike for Xiao Chengyu come from?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu Fan shook his head as he looked at Shan Yatong who was already doing the promotion. These things weren’t what he wanted to know as his manager. All he wanted to do was to make Shan Yatong an international superstar. This was his goal.</span></p>
