            <p><strong>Chapter 4.1</strong></p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The hot tongue came through her lips.</p>
<p>It pushed the ceiling of her mouth and licked her teeth. She moaned.</p>
<p>Her tongue was wrapped around his strongly. Her face slowly got heated up. She kept gulping down saliva. She didn’t even have fruit, yet her mouth was full of sweet scent of it.</p>
<p><em>Ah, melon.</em></p>
<p>She didn’t want to show that this was her first time, so her body was shaking. If Ban Woo-jin wasn’t holding her, she would’ve just collapsed.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa’s lips were locked in a rough, passionate kiss that left her breathless. She clung to the man’s shirt with both hands, holding on so tightly that her knuckles turned white.</p>
<p>Amidst this, she felt his mouth grinning.</p>
<p>Is he… laughing?</p>
<p>She was so rigid that she couldn’t breathe yet this man was so casual. He had the audacity to say that she seemed relaxed, even as he swore and acted nonchalant. It was infuriating. Her anger flared up, threatening to spill out of her.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa bit the bottom of Ban Woo-jin’s lips.</p>
<p>His lips came off of hers with him sighing. It was breathing that was most important to her right now. Yu-hwa leaned her body against the door and panted. But he was so quiet.</p>
<p><em>Did I bit too hard?</em></p>
<p>As she slowly looked up, she was lifted.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>The man picked her up like a child and started walking towards the bed. Yu-hwa understood the situation and wrapped her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>“I-I can walk myself.”</p>
<p>“You’re giving mixed signals.”</p>
<p>The man smiled again. He was now slightly laughing. She couldn’t tell what his real mood was.</p>
<p>“Why are you angry?”</p>
<p>She thought it was her who said this out of being drunk, but it was Ban Woo-jin’s voice. As if being bitten hurt quite a bit. Yu-hwa frowned and answered.</p>
<p>“Because you were laughing…”</p>
<p>“I am not talking about that.”</p>
<p>The moment her head touched the bed, Ban Woo-jin came on top of her.</p>
<p>“I’m curious why you were so angry at the bar.”</p>
<p>As Yu-hwa looked up with her eyes, he changed his face again.</p>
<p>“You’re swearing with your eyes again. Should I just shove it in? That’s what you want?”</p>
<p><em>Yes, just do it.</em> If that will make her not think again tonight, that might be the best.</p>
<p>“Yes. Do it, whatever you can.”</p>
<p>As their tongues crossed again, blood started to circulate fast again. When Yu-hwa started to breathe faster, and Ban Woo-jin would change his direction and kissed her again.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>When he stimulated her, she would just react to it. It was more of an interaction this time more than just a kiss.</p>
<p>The man’s expression suddenly shifted, his brow furrowing as he began to fumble with the buttons on Yu-hwa’s blouse. She watched with apprehension as the delicate buttons seemed to be in danger of being ripped off in his hands.</p>
<p>Fearful of what he might do, Yu-hwa quickly grabbed at the fabric of her top, holding it together as tightly as she could.</p>
<p>As Yu-hwa grabbed the buttons herself, the man smiled teasingly.</p>
<p>“I have to wear this tomorrow. I have to go somewhere…”</p>
<p>She slowly unbuttoned them. If she was alone, it would’ve already been done, but as he was staring, her fingers were shaking.</p>
<p>“You have great talent at driving someone crazy.”</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin sighed. He gulped as she unbuttoned the lasts one. As he saw thin silk slip through opened blouse, Ban Woo-jin quickly grabbed her hand.</p>
<p>“I’m out of patience for today. So…”</p>
<p>His hand went through the silk slip and grabbed her breast.</p>
<p>“Ah!!”</p>
<p>“I can’t stop now.”</p>
<p>Yu-hwa’s body flinched. His sweaty hand palmed her breast fully. The tip of her breast was already rigid. It wasn’t something she could hide with her will. She felt his hot hand over her thin bra and her waist twisted on its own.</p>
<p>Ban Woonjin was softly rubbing the centre with his thumb, took a deep breath buried his face into Yu-hwa’s neck. His wet lips sucked on her neck and bit her collarbones.</p>
<p>“Ha, why does your skin smell so sweet?”</p>
<p><em>I’m going crazy.</em> He put his lip on her upper chest and mumbled.</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin lifted her bra completely. He was staring at her swollen breast and opened his lips.</p>
<p>The man who was only caressing her breast over her bra now changed his stance. He would sensually tug her nipples. Yu-hwa felt sweaty on her back at such sensation.</p>
<p>Ban Woonjin suddenly lifted her bra off viciously and squeezed her breasts.</p>
<p>Her thighs lifted in surprise, and toes curled to grabbed the soft blanket.</p>
<p><em>I can’t wait anymore.</em> Ban Woo-jin was mumbling desperately and completely took off her shirt and bra.</p>
<p>His face came between her chest before she could stop him. He was giving bird kiss everywhere. Ban Woo-jin would take a deep breath as to soak in her sweet scent.</p>
<p>“Ha….”</p>
<p>There was instinct in his exclamation. It was like a predator taking deep breath in front of a prey it succeeded in hunting.</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin stared at her rigid peaks. He hasn’t even licked her yet but her shoulders flinched. His lips bit her nipples.</p>
<p>Ah, Yu-hwa let out a moan she has never let out in her life. She grabbed his hair, but he didn’t care. He was lightly sucking on her nipple, and he put up his tongue and started flicking it.</p>
<p>Something started to boil inside her. The sound of her moan and Ban Woo-jin licking mixed up. Her body writhed under his touch, her senses completely overwhelmed by the pleasure he was giving her.</p>
<p>She could hear his rough breathing through unbelievable sensation.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>He asked through his teeth. She felt his breath at the tip of her wet breast and gave her goosebumps.</p>
