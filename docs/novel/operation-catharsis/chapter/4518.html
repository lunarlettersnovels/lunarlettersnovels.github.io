            <p>“I’m going crazy.”</p>
<p>The sounds of his moans filled the air. Y00-hwa’s swollen lips parted with every thrust. She was seated across the man’s thighs, her arms wrapped around his neck for support. Unlike her cold body, the man’s temperature was tantalizingly warm, which made her feel good.</p>
<p>His hot hands gripped both sides of her hips tightly. He lifted her without difficulty. Two slender legs in the air wrapped around his waist.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah…”</p>
<p>He stuck out his tongue and starts teasing her chest. He licked her, then teased her with a persistent yet caressing pressure. Her buds turned swollen from his repeated caress.</p>
<p>“Why are you always…” Y00-hwa shakes her head and looks down on his face, and the man’s eyes light up in a smile.</p>
<p>“Because you’re too beautiful, it drives me crazy.”</p>
<p>“Stop that….”</p>
<p>“Stop and?”</p>
<p>This? The man’s open eyes twinkled. Soon, Y00-hwa’s body descended, and he penetrated her mercilessly from below.</p>
<p>His stiffness cut through her soaking folds at once. It trembled as it struggled to take on his size, she moaned at every penetration.</p>
<p>Her upper body completely collapsed from the intense stimulation, and she hugged his neck tightly. The man buried his face in the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>Everywhere his warm lips touched her skin, he kissed them kindly. However, the situation below was a total contrast.</p>
<p>“Ah, uh, ha!”</p>
<p>He cupped her buttocks in his hands and maneuvered it such that her small body went up and down repeatedly. The slapping sounds each time it their flesh met was lewd. She trembled as he pulled out only to plunge it deep to the root.</p>
<p>“I-it’s too. Deep, ah…!”</p>
<p>He bit the nape of Y00-hwa’s neck and continued his pursuit. A guttural moan boiled from depths of his throat. He gripped her pelvis and turned her around in a circle, using his lodged manhood as a pivot. She barely raised her eyes and looked at him. There was a blatant desire in the gazes that met hers.</p>
<p>“What is it? It’s so good. Huh?”</p>
<p>She was so distracted she couldn’t hear what he was saying. There was nothing she could do but hold on to him. His long fingers ran up her spine, as if teasing her.</p>
<p>It seemed that the wide contact area made Y00-hwa’s whole body erogenous. Every area he touches, ignites with pleasure. Suddenly, his dimples attracted her interest. Like a completely possessed woman, she could not take her eyes off it. It’s pretty. So she paid it attention, but the moment she kissed the dimple on his cheek, he flinched.</p>
<p>“You can really make people go crazy.”</p>
<p>With this, he grabbed her butt again roughly and her body went up in the air again for yet another ride.</p>
