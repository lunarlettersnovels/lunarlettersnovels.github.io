            <p><strong>Chapter 4.2</strong></p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin bit her nipple like demanding an answer.</p>
<p>“Ah! Seol….”</p>
<p>He wasn’t waiting for her to finish. His big hand slowly climbed down her side and to her bottom. Her waist twisted again, and her thighs lifted again. The man looked up.</p>
<p>“Say it.”</p>
<p>“… Hwa.”</p>
<p>“Seolhwa?”</p>
<p>She skipped the middle unintentionally as she tried to swallow her moan. It wasn’t important. She bit her lips and quickly nodded.</p>
<p>“Seol hwa, Seol hwa.”</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin continued to suckle on her nipple, his mouth hot and wet against her skin. As he did, he began to mumble her name in a low, husky voice that sent shivers down Yu-hwa’s spine.</p>
<p>It was as if he knew exactly what to do to drive her wild, and he was doing it with a skill and intensity that left her weak in the knees.</p>
<p>“Ah, don’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Do what.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk… While it’s in your mouth.”</p>
<p>Bam Woo-jin mumbled quietly. He would do one syllable at time on purpose.</p>
<p><em>Make. Me.</em></p>
<p>Yu-hwa clinched her eyes shut at such sensation.</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin placed himself between Yu-hwa’s thighs. Her pale legs were placed on top of his thick and hard thighs. Her waist was flicking so much so that her skirt was already rolled up, so her legs opened without much trouble.</p>
<p>She covered her eyes with the back of her hand as she could feel his glaring gaze towards her bottom.</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin folded Yu-hwa’s knee and grabbed her ankle. His hot hand wrapped around her calf and slowly moved towards her knee.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa blinked fast as if she was trying to check all of this is a reality. Ban Woo-jin rubbed in circular motion with his thumb and slowly moved down her thigh.</p>
<p>“Ut hut.”</p>
<p>As her legs started shaking, he grabbed it hard. She saw where his hand was headed and was nervous.</p>
<p>A wave of anxiety washed over Yu-hwa, and she found herself holding her breath as she watched the man fumble with the buttons on her blouse. Her nerves were so jangled that she covered her mouth with her hand, worried that she might let out some strange, involuntary noise.His thumb touched her pubic area. Her body trembled and her bottom suddenly felt hot.</p>
<p>She felt something spilling out.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa’s hands gripped the bedsheets tightly as the man’s hand continued to rub against her wet panties with increasing force, as if he were losing his patience.</p>
<p>She could barely control the waves of pleasure that were crashing through her body, making her feel as though her skin was melting from the heat of it all.</p>
<p>She could feel his finger pressing against the fabric of her underwear, and it felt as if it could easily pierce through and enter her body. The anticipation was almost too much to bear, and she found herself arching her back and letting out a soft whimper.</p>
<p>As Yu-hwa’s thighs continued to tremble with anticipation, Ban Woo-jin leaned in closer and locked his body against hers.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa’s breath caught in her throat as she felt his long finger slip inside her panties and begin to explore her most intimate parts.</p>
<p>“Ha, will it work, it’s so narrow…”</p>
<p><em>This is crazy.</em> Ban Woo-jin said.</p>
<p>“I can’t even put two-fold in.”</p>
<p>As Yu-hwa was about to raise her torso, he grabbed her shoulders. Then he came up to kiss her lips, nose and eyes in that order and scolded her.</p>
<p>“I’ll try, I’ll try to make it not hurt.”</p>
<p>Yu-hwa bit her lips and nodded.</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin was going through her. The tongue that came into her mouth stimulated her. At the same time, the finger was coming in and out as to try to measure the inside.</p>
<p>She couldn’t let out her moan as her mouth was covered so she held onto Ban Woo-jin’s neck tightly. Each time his finger came in and out there was wet sound.</p>
<p>It was in that exact moment that the man’s finger, which had been deep inside her, shifted and hit a spot inside her that sent a jolt of pleasure through her body.</p>
<p>She let out a low moan as he continued to scratch at the spot, causing her pleasure to build to a fever pitch.</p>
<p>When his finger finally slid out of her, she felt an immediate rush of fluid spilling out of her, and her eyes flew open as she gasped for air, her body still shaking with the aftershocks of her orgasm.</p>
<p>“Uh! Wait..”</p>
<p>“No, it’s ok.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not…”</p>
<p>The man kissed her as to calm her down. Then another finger came in. He twisted his wrist and folded his finger.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah!”</p>
<p>“Here, right.”</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin kept on poking one spot. It was turning her on in a way she didn’t even know she could.</p>
<p>Her legs were shaking on their own, and her waist moved in accord to him.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa shuddered as a rush of intense pleasure surged through her body, causing her to arch her back and let out a gasp.</p>
<p>A warm, sticky liquid spilled out of her, evidence of her body’s overwhelming response to the sensation. It was like her cells were on fire, flaring up and then exploding in a frenzy of ecstasy.</p>
<p>The pleasure was so intense that she had never felt anything like it before.</p>
