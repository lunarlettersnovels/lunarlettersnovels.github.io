            <p><strong>Chapter 1.1</strong></p>
<p>As Yu-hwa made her way into the crowded lounge bar on the twentieth floor of the Glint Hotel, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of awe at the opulent surroundings. Despite the fact that it was a weekday, the bar was packed with people, and she found herself wondering why Thursdays seemed to be even more crowded than Fridays these days.</p>
<p>She looked around the room, taking in the stunning decor. The lounge bar spanned two floors, with a high ceiling that gave the space a feeling of openness. Hundreds of flower-shaped glass lights twinkled from a grand chandelier that hung from above. The atmosphere was intimidating, and Yu-hwa felt a chill run down her spine as the cold air from the air conditioning wrapped around her exposed arms.</p>
<p>She flexed her sore fingers, trying to shake off the feeling of nervousness as she approached the bar. “Welcome. Please verify your membership card or room key,” the bartender greeted her, and Yu-hwa fumbled in her purse for her card.</p>
<p>As Yu-hwa presented her room key to the staff member at the entrance of the Glint lounge bar, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of detachment from the stylishly dressed patrons who filled the room. She had come here alone, feeling out of place among the people who seemed to fit so seamlessly into this luxurious setting.</p>
<p>Wrapping her arms around herself, she tried to shake off the feeling of alienation as the employee in a black suit asked her if she had any friends inside. “No, I came here alone,” she replied, glancing around at the people seated at the tables, their faces alight with excitement.</p>
<p>“Currently, there are no regular table seats available,” the staff member informed her. “Would you like seats at the bar table?”</p>
<p>“Sure, no problem,” Yu-hwa said, grateful for the opportunity to at least have a place to sit and watch the goings-on. She followed the staff member to the bar, trying to ignore the feeling of discomfort that lingered within her.</p>
<p>As Yu-hwa settled into her seat at the bar, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief.<em> As long as there is alcohol</em>, she would be able to get through this night. She was surprised to find that the high bar stool was softer than she had expected, and she leaned back comfortably as the bartender approached with a menu.</p>
<p>The man’s hand moved gracefully as he presented the list to her, and Yu-hwa caught a hint of a smoky, woody perfume. It was a scent that suited the luxurious atmosphere of the bar perfectly.</p>
<p>“This is the menu list. Please take a look and call me when you’re ready to order,” the bartender said, and Yu-hwa set to work scanning the offerings. She had come to the lounge bar tonight with one goal in mind: to enjoy the most expensive whiskey on the menu. It was her last night in town, and she was determined to make the most of it.</p>
<p>She flipped past the list of snacks and landed on the a la carte bottle menu, her eyes drawn to the 2.9 million won whiskey at the top of the list. Yu-hwa’s eyebrows twitched slightly at the high price, but she was determined to indulge herself tonight.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa couldn’t help but feel a sense of panic as she gazed at the thick wad of cash in her wallet. She had withdrawn part of her deposit that morning, and no matter how much she had, it was still close to 3 million won. It was more money than she knew what to do with, and she found herself overwhelmed by the choices in front of her.</p>
<p>In the end, she opted for a more rational choice, ordering a 300,000 won whiskey from the middle of the list. It was a significant upgrade from the 1,500 won soju she was used to, but it was still only a fraction of what she had at her disposal.</p>
<p>As the bartender expertly opened the bottle and poured the whiskey into a glass, Yu-hwa requested that it be served neat, without ice. She took a sip, relishing the feeling of the hot liquid burning its way down her esophagus. It was a sensation that she had never experienced before, and she found herself wondering why she had never turned to whiskey instead of soju in the past.</p>
<p>But as she took another drink, she couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had settled over her. She had heard the older orphans at the orphanage say it countless times before: “Why are you like this? You’re ruining the mood.” Did they see her as someone who couldn’t find warmth, someone who would always bring them down? Yu-hwa couldn’t help but wonder as she drained the rest of her glass and signaled for another.</p>
