            <p><strong>Chapter 5.1</strong></p>
<p>“Did it hurt?”</p>
<p>Even though he caused it, she felt emotional as he looked at her sympathetically and warmly. It wasn’t just because of the over stimulation he gave her. It felt like the hardship that built inside exploded with his consolation.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa held onto the man’s neck and bawled. Her bottom still felt hot from what happened earlier. Ban Woo-jin hugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>It was the first time she bawled like this since Seol Inseop got into an accident. Would this man believe her if she told him it was the first time in 6 years?</p>
<p>With his face all red, Ban Woo-jin examined Yu-hwa carefully.</p>
<p>“Should I stop?” he whispered, licking up her tears. He asked with such earnestness that it seemed he was pleading with her not to ask him to stop.</p>
<p>As Yu-hwa slowly shook her head, his eyes changed color. They became filled with greed.</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin brushed his hair back, his fingers tangling in his sweat-dampened locks. As he dropped his hand, his white dress shirt took on a warm, red hue from the light.</p>
<p>Click, his pants buckle came off. Through that, she could see his black underwear, and there was something that was sticking out.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa gulped.</p>
<p><em>Huh?</em></p>
<p>Her mouth dropped as she saw the size of what Ban Woo-jin took out. As she blinked her big eyes a few times, he laughed.</p>
<p>“Even if you make that face, there’s no turning back now.”</p>
<p>He ripped the condom open and put it on his thing. He mumbled that it was small. Yu-hwa’s mouth moved as she saw the condom barely getting around it.</p>
<p>“Well…” She muttered.</p>
<p>“I told you. I used up all my patience for today.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just long but it was also thick. She finally understood why he was putting his finger into her and trying to check whether it would be possible or not.</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin kneeled between Yu-hwa’s thighs and pushed up her folded legs. Her butt was lifted and her wet panties came off. He rubbed his manhood once. If possible, it felt like it became bigger.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin positioned his enlarged manhood against Yu-hwa’s folds and slowly rubbed it. The sensation of the meat sliding up and down was so intense that it made her stop breathing.</p>
<p>“You’re very wet,” he remarked as he moved his hands down to grab her thighs again.</p>
<p>He rubbed his manhood against her once more, while his finger slowly stimulated her clitoris. This touch made her even more aroused.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa moaned and ripped the sheet, her toes curling up in pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ut! D, don’t do that.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? My hand? D*ck?”</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin kneeled between Yu-hwa’s thighs and positioned his manhood against her folds, slowly rubbing it. The meat that was sliding up and down felt like it was going to come in at any moment and made her stop breathing.</p>
<p>“You’re very wet,” he remarked, his hands grabbing her thighs and moving down again. He rubbed against her again with his enlarged manhood, and his finger slowly rubbed against her clitoris.</p>
<p>She became more aroused by such touch, moaning shortly while ripping the sheet, her toes up.</p>
<p>It was that moment. His thick and hard head came into her narrow hole, and Yu-hwa shivered, already overloaded with the stimulation she could handle.</p>
<p>“Ah!” she cried out in pain, barely able to breathe.</p>
<p>“Ah, shit,” Ban Woo-jin swore quietly. She couldn’t come to her mind. His meat that came out came in a bit more this time. Her hot bottom was being crushed.</p>
<p>“Ah, uh, uh….” she moaned in discomfort.</p>
<p>“Feels like it’s going to get cut off. Please, breathe a little,” he said with concern.She couldn’t even answer him and just moved her lips. He was the reason why she couldn’t breathe. She couldn’t get enough air from her short breathing. Her heartbeat was beating with where he was touching.</p>
<p>“Don’t give it pressure.” Ban Woo-jin also looked like he was in pain.</p>
<p>“I’m, not, ah… It’s, too big.”</p>
<p>Yu-hwa was barely able to speak.</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin’s top came over her and bit her breast. He bit her nipple a little and rolled it with his tongue. He was squeezing the side breast and then his lips came over it too. Her vision was white from all the pleasure. He came in during all of this.</p>
<p>He covered her mouth that was moaning with his lips. When the kiss ended, Yu-hwa took a quick breather.</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin kissed Yu-hwa’s teary eyes. Then moved his waist back and came back in again.</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin slowly moved his waist and slowly increased the speed. Yu-hwa’s legs shivered due to the rhythmical movement.</p>
<p>“Please, slow down…ugh!”</p>
<p>Ban Woo-jin released her hand, which was gripping the sheet tightly, and lifted it up slowly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>He placed her palm against his lips and began kissing each of her fingers. Despite the intensity of his movements, his eyes remained soft and warm.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa felt everything on the back of her hand from the soft sheet, and the warmth of his fingers through their interlock.</p>
