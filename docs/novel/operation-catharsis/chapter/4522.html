            <p><strong>Chapter 3.2</strong></p>
<p>“Catharsis…. How strong is it?”</p>
<p>“Who knows.”</p>
<p>The man lowered himself and whispered into her ears.</p>
<p>“You’ll know once you try it.”</p>
<p>Yu-hwa took her neck back in surprise. She grabbed her ears. There was heat in her hand.</p>
<p>She quickly looked down and lifted the drink. She was anticipating the alcohol taste that was hidden behind the lime smell….</p>
<p>Lime…?</p>
<p>There was no alcohol taste.</p>
<p>She didn’t drink well but the only way to forget about her complicated life was to drink a bottle of soju after work. So even though she finished a bottle of whiskey, she could still tell whether what she was drinking was alcoholic or not.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa put the glass down and looked him up again. His eyes were serious.</p>
<p>Was he flirting? No. It was different from the eyes that the man who sat next to her had before. She wasn’t sure but she knew that he wasn’t simply trying to flirt with her.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Yu-hwa suddenly wasn’t pleased. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“It seemed like you didn’t like alcohol.”</p>
<p>There was still a bit of teasing in his voice. Is he joking?</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been looking at you for a while but it seemed like you didn’t like it. You don’t have to drink it if you don’t like the taste?”</p>
<p>The alcohol was already gone. Just when was he…</p>
<p>“Since when…”</p>
<p>“Since you first came in here.”</p>
<p>He answered before she even finished. His voice suddenly got serious.</p>
<p>“Mm, honestly that was just excuse…. I honestly felt worried.”</p>
<p><em>Worried?</em> Yu-hwa looked at his face. Ban Woo-jin scratched his head and continued.</p>
<p>“You make mistakes if you drink on a sad day. There’s nothing I can do about what you’ve already drank, but this is more of precaution.”</p>
<p>A sad day.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to acknowledge it, but it pushed all of her senses and overwhelmed her.</p>
<p>Who are you to think you can console me? Why are you worrying about me? Just try to flirt with me instead like other men.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa couldn’t understand why no one seemed to care about her well-being without the promise of a reward. It didn’t make sense to her, and she found herself feeling isolated and alone.</p>
<p>This man wanted something from her.</p>
<p>“Ban Woo-jin, what do you want from me?” she blurted out, her lips moving before she could even think.</p>
<p>“Do you want to sleep with me?” She asked.</p>
<p>It was a provocation.</p>
<p>“Don’t try to console me and sleep with me. Isn’t that what you want?”</p>
<p>The man laughed. He brushed his hair back annoyingly and licked his bottom lip.</p>
<p>She instinctively knew. The man with a pretty smile was no longer going to be kind to her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Her hand was grabbed in the air, and the tongue immediately came in her mouth. It filled up her mouth. It was the soft spot that she didn’t allow anyone else to touch until now.</p>
<p>He quickly wrapped his tongue on hers and sucked on it hard.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>Yu-hwa couldn’t let out the moan that came up to her throat.</p>
<p>His lips moved to her earlobe. He was licked and bit it. She let out moan while she was being chewed. Something inside her started to heat up.</p>
<p>“Are you normally this easy?”</p>
<p>He sounded angry. His big body moved up and down in rhythm. The man’s eyes lost focus and looked actually angry.</p>
<p>She couldn’t understand why he was angry. If he was looking at her the moment she walked in, then wasn’t this his mission? But he looked like he was wronged.</p>
<p>“Why, do you like something that’s harder?”</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>The man closed his eyes and exclaimed. Then his eyes flashed. He looked like a beast in front of his meal.</p>
<p>The censor on the light ended and the darkness came. The light hasn’t turned on as the key wasn’t in the card slot. The faint orange light that was coming from outside outlined his silhouette.</p>
<p>The man took his suit jacket off and threw it on the table. Then the tie came off. She felt anxious as she didn’t know how he was going to move.</p>
<p>He stepped closer. She took a step back and hit the door.</p>
<p>“Ban Woo-jin, not here but on the bed….”</p>
<p>His arm wrapped Yu-hwa’s waist. Their bottom stuck together as he pulled her in.</p>
<p>“Ha….”</p>
<p>Her lips opened automatically as she felt the girth underneath her stomach. There was something that made her dizzy that wasn’t his middle.</p>
<p>It was the smell of his cologne with his own scent. The smell that was in the bar lounge. This smoky sense.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Ha, you’re thinking something else in the middle of all this?”</p>
<p>So relaxed.</p>
<p>With that, he started. Ban Woo-jin immediately overtook her lips.</p>
