            </h1>
        </header>

        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Doggy Qu Zhi! I, Zheng Baozhu, will never forgive you for this!” </strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My Dream.” Zheng Baozhu looked at the paper on the wall and began to read it. “My dream is to become a beautiful female celebrity like my aunt. I want to be like her. I want to wear the most fashionable big wavy curls, wear the brightest earrings and necklaces, and have the most beautiful nails. I also want to act like my little aunt. I want everyone to watch my movies. The mall will have to put my poster where everyone can see it. They will say, ‘Wow, it’s Zheng Baozhu. She’s so beautiful!’ I hope that one day I will be as bright as my aunt and my whole body will shine!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of the composition was the comment that the teacher had written for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being a celebrity isn’t just about looking bright and beautiful on the surface. They also suffer from the hardships of filming. We can’t just consider their bright side. We also need to understand the hard work and significance of their job. I hope that in the future when Baozhu experiences setbacks, she won’t give up lightly. That way she can one day become a shining female star. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiayou</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was very moving, but she only managed a modest B-.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hm</span></i><b><i>.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She remembered that Qu Zhi received an A+ on his composition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi’s grades had been very good ever since he was young. After graduating from high school, he naturally went to study abroad and exited Zheng Baozhu’s life. Ever since he left, she felt that her life had begun to reach its peak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she did not manage to apply for the film academy after graduation, she had an exceptional talent for business. Or was it her luck? Ever since college, she had been making money whenever she wanted. It had been such smooth sailing that her business continuously grew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, her dream of being a female celebrity had not changed even to this day. In the third semester of her senior year, she secretly set a small goal for herself. Once she earned fifteen million dollars, she would pursue her dream without her family’s knowledge!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was about to take her first step toward this great dream!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu knew that her age, 25 years and 1 month, would make it difficult to enter the entertainment industry. Especially now that the debut age was getting younger and younger. However, it did not matter. She did not intend to be an idol anyways. In her aunt Su Mingmei’s era, a lot of superstars had started out with walk-on parts. She wanted to try it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu was not from an academic class. She had only studied acting for a few months with her teacher. By doing this, she could hone her acting skills while keeping it completely hidden from her family. This way she could enter the entertainment industry with the least commotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, she had gotten up early to go to the film studio complex and get to know the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu took a shower first. Then, she dried her hair and stepped into her walk-in closet. Clothes, shoes bags, accessories, and anything else you could wear filled her giant closet. She even made a personal stage to show off her favorite gold gown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s lucky color is green…” Zheng Baozhu picked a French-style sharp-necked jacket and paired it with a vintage green skirt. Before she turned off the app[mfn]probably she was browsing weibo for today’s fortune[/mfn], she caught a glimpse of “Today’s Star Language” at the top.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you looking forward to the reunion?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu raised her slender eyebrows, closed the app, and went downstairs to eat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, City A was vigorously developing its southern blocks. The construction of Starlight Park and Starlight Farm had brought a lot of popularity to the area. Zheng Baozhu’s Garden Wind Hotel was a popular accommodation in Starlight Farm. Although it was not comparable to a five-star hotel in the public center, it attracted many tourists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu was staying at her hotel. She ate three meals a day in the kitchen. The hotel had a cafeteria and a Chinese restaurant. Guests could eat both pizza and steak as well as farmhouse stir fry.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">When Liang Huihui saw her come down, she quickly brought breakfast to Zheng Baozhu’s table. “Miss Baozhu, your breakfast!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you.” Zheng Baozhu smiled at her and thanked her. She picked up the spoon with her hand somehow enhancing her already exquisite beauty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Liang Huihui was still struck by that beauty. She stood next to Zheng Baozhu and said, “Miss Baozhu, I heard that the Science Park will have a new company today. It’s an artificial intelligence company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh…” Zheng Baozhu nodded her head. The science and technology park was another key project for the government in the development of the area. Construction had only been completed at the beginning of the year. The result was a beautiful park that a number of technology companies had entered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liang Huihui asked, “Is artificial intelligence just a robot?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More or less.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liang Huihui suddenly wore a strange expression. “I saw it on the news before. There are already robots in hotels and restaurants in China. They’re studying this. Are they here to steal our jobs?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu finally understood why she was gossiping today. So she was worried about losing her job? She chuckled at Liang Huihui’s thoughts and looked up at her. “It’s possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That…that won’t do. A robot doesn’t have feelings!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu smiled, “Alright, robots can’t completely replace humans in a short period of time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liang Huihui felt relieved when she heard that. She put away her plate and walked a few steps before turning around to add, “Could a robot greet customers with a smile like I can?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she said that, Liang Huihui revealed the most brilliant smile of her life featuring two white front teeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……” Zheng Baozhu was swayed by her smile. Huihui had given it her all in order not to lose her job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the threat to their jobs, everyone had a prejudice against this new technology company. Zheng Baozhu heard them whispering and smiled as she opened Weibo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu would log on to Weibo every day to learn about the entertainment industry she hoped to enter. The first thing to do was to look at the hot search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the familiar names and a few pieces of political news, one topic stood out to her—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How high could an ordinary person’s looks be?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu entered excitedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yan Xinglian is the most attractive #How impressive could a normal person’s look be? #Come, come, come, let’s post the most handsome amateur guy you’ve seen!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hot reviews were all handsome photos, but the most eye-catching one was definitely Hot One. After all, he was a man who relied on half of his face to win a few praises from Hot Two!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone, move aside! This was what I saw at the airport in the morning. A real handsome guy could turn people upside down with just half a face! [Picture]”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man in the picture was wearing a mask. His short, soft, black hair was lazily styled. However, the pair of eyes looking at the camera were striking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu’s heart skipped a beat when she saw this. His masculine energy was almost tangible, even through the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hint of displeasure in his eyes indicated he may have noticed the person secretly photographing him. Although the mask covered the lower half of his face, she could recognize his superior bone structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Holy shit, he’s so handsome. I declare that he’s today’s champion!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, the handsome guy’s eyes are too fierce. He’s shooting my heart through the camera!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hubby!!!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll just leave a chicken coop here[doge].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t allow this kind of fish to escape the entertainment industry. Handsome guy, debut!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A City International Airport? I was at the airport in the morning, but I missed the handsome guy?!![vomiting blood]”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu stretched her chin and frowned as she stared at the man on her phone. A strange feeling was creeping over her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I being haunted? Why does this person resemble Qu Zhi the more I look?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The author had something to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu: My peak of life seems to be on the verge of collapse.</span></p>
