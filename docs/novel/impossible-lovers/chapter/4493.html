            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Great Beauty by the Window</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they could order takeout within Science Park, Qi Sheng had heard about the Garden Wind Hotel’s famous small, stir-fried vegetables and insisted they go for lunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think you’re here for a stir-fry. You just want to see Zheng Baozhu, right?” Qu Zhi had read Qi Sheng’s mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, yes, yes.” Qi Sheng chuckled as he looked cheerfully at Qu Zhi. “I’ve heard about it before. The restaurant is only open to the public during the off-season. Normally, you wouldn’t have the opportunity to try it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Qi Sheng said was true. The Chinese restaurant at Garden Wind Hotel was one of the most sought-after eateries in Starlight Farm. Between orders from tourist groups and guests during the high season, the restaurant could not accept scattered orders from the public. During the off-season, the restaurant saw far fewer customers so it would open to the public. Most of these customers ordered takeout, so few guests dined in the restaurant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After listening to him, Qu Zhi looked at him and snorted, “Since I stay here, I can come and eat with my room card.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qi Sheng, “……” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn it, he pretended to do it again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Qu, have you come for lunch?” Liang Huihui had seen Qu Zhi enter and greeted him warmly. “Is this your friend?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, yes, hello.” Qi Sheng greeted Liang Hui Hui very naturally. He turned around and saw Zheng Baozhu sitting by the window. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Old Qu!” He pulled Qu Zhe abruptly and stared excitedly at Zheng Baozhu. “That pretty girl by the window isn’t Zheng Baozhu!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi looked over and saw Zheng Baozhu. She wore the same clothes they had seen her in that morning. The hair on her left was behind her ear, revealing a sparkling pearl earring. The exquisite hairpin and the brilliant gems on her fingertips gleamed brightly in the sunlight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi even felt that she was sitting by the window for this very reason, to make her accessories shine even more in the sun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, it’s her.” He replied casually. He continued to Qi Sheng beside him, “It’s easy to tell, she’s exactly the same as XiuXiu?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qi Sheng, “……” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seemed to be something wrong, but there was nothing wrong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liang Huihui was also taken aback. XiuXiu? Was it that magical animal from the movie? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps sensing their gazes, Zheng Baozhu also looked up and immediately saw Qu Zhi standing at the door. There was another person beside him. He was not as tall as Qu Zhi, but he was quite handsome. Judging from the badge hanging around his neck, he should be Qu Zhi’s colleague. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qi Sheng pulled Qu Zhi straight over and took a closer look. He felt that Zheng Baozhu was moving. “Hello, aren’t you Old Qu’s childhood sweetheart? You’re as beautiful as he said!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu wanted to refute the word “sweetheart,” but then realized that it was not the main problem with what he had said. “What? He praised me for being beautiful?” Zheng Baozhu raised her eyes and glanced at Qu Zhi, who was standing beside the other man. “Why don’t I buy it?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi glanced at Qi Sheng then said to Zheng Baozhu, “Because he has only scratched the surface of my original words.”                                                                                                            Qi Sheng, “……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qi Sheng thought that, with such a foul mouth, it was thanks to his good looks that Gu Zhi had been able to survive so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, Zheng Baozhu’s mood did not sour on the spot. She nodded gently and understandingly replied, “Oh, that’s indeed a compliment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Right!” Qi Sheng heaved a sigh of relief and sat down across from her. “I forgot to introduce myself. I’m Qu Zhi’s colleague, Qi Sheng.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu praised, “You’re blessed with a good name.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You flatter me,” Qi Sheng replied with a simple smile, “It’s mainly because my father’s surname is Qi and my mother’s surname is Sheng.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu, “…” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as people said, “High-end ingredients often only require the simplest cooking method.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, since we’ve already met, can we eat together?” Qi Sheng asked with a smile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu glanced at Qu straight and nodded. “Sure, but I didn’t order enough. You guys can order a few more dishes that you like.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure!” Qi Sheng pulled the man who was still standing there and sat down. Liang Huihui handed them the menu. Qi Sheng ordered a few signature dishes and happily waited for them to arrive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu seemed to have thought of something. She reluctantly asked Qu Zhi, “Tongtong said that she wants to get together for dinner. It would be here, and I would come as well. Do you have time tonight?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cen Tongtong was Zheng Baozhu and Qu Zhi’s good friend. The three of them lived in the same neighborhood. Even though Cen Tongtong went to a different school, they had all grown up together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cen Tongtong had mentioned this matter to Qu Zhi that morning. Qu Zhi had been busy at the time and had not replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought about it and nodded, “Sure.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright then, I’ll let her know.” Zheng Baozhu scooped a few spoonfuls of soup into her bowl. “Also, Meng Yaxin. She is also coming tonight.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Meng Yaxin? “Quzhi looked up at Zheng Baozhu. Meng Yaxin was their high school classmate and was very close to Zheng Baozhu when she was studying. “You two still keep in touch?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, we are good friends. Is that a problem?” Zheng Baozhu curled her lips in contempt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A good friend?” Qu Zhi sneered and glanced at Zheng Baozhu. “Does Meng Yaxin know that you’re friends with her because she has three gold coins in her name?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu, “…………”</span></p>
