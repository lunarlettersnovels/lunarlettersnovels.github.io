            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Qu Zhi This Evil Star Has Returned!!! </strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Qu Zhi left, Xiao Yu turned to her excitedly, “Miss Baozhu, I heard that Mr. Qu and you are childhood sweethearts? He looks good!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……” Zheng Baozhu’s brows twitched. She didn’t know what to complain about first. “Xiao Yu, please sober up. People who grew up together aren’t always childhood sweethearts. They might be irreconcilable enemies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why?” Xiao Yu was a little stunned. Did Miss Baozhu have a grudge against Mr. Qu? Love and hate relationship?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liang Huihui took a few quick steps forward, following Xiao Yu to gossip, “Miss Baozhu, Mr. Qu is working at the newly-listed technology company!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu nodded. “Is it that artificial intelligence company that wants to steal your jobs?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No.” Liang Huihui’s tone was completely different from that morning. When she talked about Qu Zhi, her eyes were filled with excitement. “I’ve already asked Mr. Qu about it. They’re mainly studying robots to assist the blind. It’s very meaningful!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heh.” She scoffed disdainfully and said to them, “He likes to do things like fishing for fame. You mustn’t be fooled by him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liang Huihui and Xiao Yu looked at each other, disbelieving. “Miss Baozhu, do you have any misunderstanding with Mr. Qu?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no misunderstanding.” She wrapped an arm around Liang Huihui’s shoulder. My silly Huihui, think about it. They can even research robots to help the blind. Isn’t a food delivery robot much simpler than this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liang Huihui: “……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it seemed to make sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t be fooled by him just because he’s handsome,” Zheng Baozhu said earnestly. “He’s hypocritical, pretentious, and self-righteous. He’s even biased against beautiful girls!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Yu was stunned. “But doesn’t he look good himself?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s why I’m saying that there’s something wrong with his thoughts. Don’t come into contact with him in the future.” Zheng Baozhu was afraid that the little flowers in her hotel would be harmed by Qu Zhi. She was so worried that she said, “How long has he been here for? Did you guys get so much information about him?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xiao Yu responded, “Mr. Qu came here in the morning. He left his luggage here and went to the office, then came back to check-in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh…” Zheng Baozhu nodded and told them to stay away from him before going upstairs. She took a shower and had the restaurant deliver dinner to her room. Then, she sat on the sofa on the balcony and looked at her phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extras group that she had added earlier had already accepted her, and someone was talking inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Jingyi: Today, I went to see a film crew. Most of the people in the queue were guys. Are girls so hard to get?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guo Bin: It’s because all the girls are interviewing at night[mfn]talking about sleeping around to get roles[/mfn]. [chuckle]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Jingyi: Do you think you’re funny?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guo Bin: Isn’t that so? You know what you girls are like. What are you pretending for?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Jingyi: Come, come, tell me what we girls like [smile]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guo Bin: How many serious women are in the film and television city? Don’t just stand here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu raised her eyebrows. Wasn’t she a serious actress in the film and television city? Then what was that guy who played an extra?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Bao Zhu: @Guo Bin, this big brother, your sourness is overflowing through the screen. The times are different now. You guys can also go interview at night! I think you’ll be pretty good at it. Why are you wasting your time in the group? Hurry and pack yourself up and go to the interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Zheng Baozhu said that, Guo Bin exploded. He cursed and scolded the group leader.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dazhang: That Guo Bin has been kicked out of the group. Everyone, please communicate well and respect each other. [Smile]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the group leader came out, everyone shut up. She had just taken a bite of her food when she received a message from the system. It was the girl called Wang Jingyi who had sent her a friend request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu’s slender fingers poked the screen and agreed to the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Jingyi: Sister, thank you for just now. [big smile]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu: What’s there to thank for? Everyone has a responsibility to educate an idiot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Jingyi: Hahaha, I think you’re new here. If there’s something you don’t understand, you can ask me. There are a lot of people in film and television city, and girls are easy targets, so you need to pay more attention to your safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu: Yes, thank you, sister. [Refined Brush]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Jingyi: You’re welcome! Our group is just a backup group, there is still an official group in front of us. If they have empty spots, they come to us. Let’s work together! [Struggle]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Zheng Baozhu’s first time hearing about this.  “I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wang Jingyi: Yes, my goal is to work hard to become an official actor. First, there will be a small role, a medium role, a large role, and finally a supporting actress and a female lead!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu: Good luck! You’ll definitely achieve it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the two of them were chatting, Zheng Baozhu was asked by the group to record a video. After she was done, she put on her face mask and went to sleep early. The next day, she still got up early. She was putting on makeup when Xiao Cen called.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She pressed hands-free mode and asked, “Tong Tong, what’s up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cen Tong Tong’s gossipy voice came from the receiver. “I heard Qu Zhi returned home? He even went to your place?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu smirked. “You don’t leave home all day, but you’re so well informed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cen Tong Tong reminded her, “It’s the treasure pearl. It’s already the 5G era and even the dogs in the village will be online.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, what’s going on with you two? You didn’t fight, did you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…… If that’s all you want to ask, I’ll hang up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, No.” Her friend quickly changed the topic. “Didn’t you go to the film city yesterday? How was it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t mention it.” With that said, Zheng Baozhu became angry again,” I had a fight with Sun Jing on set, and the prospects of a good deal are gone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cen’s Tong Tong quickly digested her words. “So the target of your argument was Sun Jing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…… Is this the main point? The main point is that I’m very angry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tong Tong’s pupils widened. “Do you need me to say it? Just invest some of your own money to create a role for yourself and bring your money into the group.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Isn’t that just buying my way in?” Zheng Baozhu looked serious. “I just scolded Sun Jing yesterday for that, so how can I be that type of person myself?! I want to rely on my own ability to get a role and become an actor that the audience likes, like my aunt!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright, alright, don’t get excited. I support your dream! “Cen Tong Tong quickly declared. “Are you still going today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not going today. I have an interview this morning,” she replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah? You’ve only been to the film city once and the media already want to interview you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu raised her eyebrows and looked into the mirror. “It’s not an interview with female celebrity Zheng Baozhu. It’s an interview with female entrepreneur Zheng Baozhu.”</span></p>
