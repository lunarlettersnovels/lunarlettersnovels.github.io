            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Doggy Qu Zhi! I, Zheng Baozhu, will never forgive you for this!”</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu first met her aunt Su Mingmei at the Spring Festival when she was six years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Mingmei wore a slim-fitting light-colored qipao[mfn]</span><a href="https://dressx.com/products/qipao-iii"><span style="font-weight: 400;">photo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">[/mfn]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Her hair was fashionably styled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in big, loose curls. She had casually pulled her black hair behind one ear revealing a shiny pearl earring. On the other side, her hair was draped over her chest covering half of the matching pearl necklace. She sat in front of a huge poster with a cigarette in her slender fingers. A thin wisp of smoke rose from her exquisite fingertips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Mingmei didn’t fit in with the excitement of the Spring Festival, but she was utterly gorgeous. Zheng Baozhu couldn’t look away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu, her mind blank, stood at the door looking at Su Mingmei. Zheng Baozhu completely forgot that her grandmother had asked her to call her aunt over for dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensing someone’s eyes on her, Su Mingmei turned her head. When she saw the tiny figure standing in the doorway, she smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her smile was perfectly copied on the poster behind her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Mingmei herself was depicted on the poster. Six-year-old Zheng Baozhu heard countless adults discussing Su Mingmei, both her aunt and the most popular female celebrity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her movie posters lined the streets as far as the eye could see. Her jewelry advertisements ran on television constantly. Her fervent fans could circle the world twice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Mingmei, however, committed suicide when she was just 25-years-old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu never would have imagined that her first meeting Su Mingmei would also be her final farewell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That spring was exceptionally bright and beautiful. Su Mingmei’s film ‘No More Spring’ was released that season. The film described a depressed painter. After experiencing a series of twists and turns and love-hate relationships, the artist committed suicide with a toxic paint called Paris Green. After her death, the value of her artwork soared. Most notably, her last piece ‘No More Spring’ sold for an astonishing price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The painter died in spring, and so did Su Mingmei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people said that she couldn’t land a role; others said she had a bad relationship. No matter what outsiders said, Su Mingmei had become a taboo amongst the Su and Zheng families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the term “female celebrity” became taboo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was under these circumstances that Zheng Baozhu confronted the taboo head-on. She wrote the words “female celebrity” on her homework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Baozhu, Qu Zhi, how come you guys came out ten minutes late today?” Zheng Baozhu’s mother, Su Mingxi, had come to pick up her daughter from school. She also brought Zheng Baozhu’s deskmate, Qu Zhi, home along the way. Qu Zhi and Zheng Baozhu lived in the same neighborhood. His parents were both involved in scientific research. When they got busy, they asked their neighbor, Su Mingxi, to take care of their son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi was a boy, but he was handsome and smart. Su Mingxi liked him very much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi raised his head to answer Su Mingxi’s question, “Today’s last class was composition class. Teacher Zhang has asked us to write an essay. We can’t leave school until we finish writing.’’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I see.” Su Mingxi held Zheng Baozhu’s hand in her left and Qu Zhi’s in her right as they walked toward the parking spot. “What’s the topic of the essay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi said, ”《 My Dream 》.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Mingxi asked curiously, “What did you write, Qu Zhi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Scientist,” he said as he straightened his back. He looked as neat as the words written on his assignment. “I want to become a scientist and contribute to the development of my country just like my parents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, Zheng Baozhu rolled her eyes and snorted internally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other children, especially Zheng Baozhu, were naïve and cute when they spoke. Not Qu Zhi. He really knew how to speak beautiful words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Su Mingxi was very happy. After praising Qu Zhi, she turned around and asked, “What did you write, Baozhu?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me? I…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Zheng Baozhu wrote about becoming an actress.” Zheng Baozhu had only just opened her mouth when Qu Zhi replied. “I saw it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu clearly felt the hand around hers tighten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her hand ached with the increased pressure. Before she could squeeze out a few tears to gain sympathy, Su Mingxi looked at her with raised eyebrows. “Zheng Baozhu! You still want to be a female celebrity?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shocked Zheng Baozhu reflexively yanked her hand away and ran off. Su Mingxi chased and cursed after her, “Do you want to be a female celebrity? I’ll beat you to death today!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t! Qu Zhi is talking nonsense!” Zheng Baozhu was making a scene at the school gate. None of the parents passing by extended a helping hand to her. Instead, they giggled as they watched. Qu Zhi also watched from the side. He looked like a righteous messenger. “I didn’t speak nonsense. Auntie Su, you will know if you ask Teacher Zhang.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good, you even learned to lie!” Su Mingxi caught Zheng Baozhu and scolded,” You’re getting bolder and bolder. You have been spoiled! You want to become a female celebrity? Do you dare tell your grandparents?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waaah!” Despite her wailing, Zheng Baozhu did not forget to scold Qu Zhi. “Doggy Qu Zhi! I, Zheng Baozhu, will never forgive you for this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps it was these words that woke Zheng Baozhu from her sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phone on the bedside table was still vibrating. She reached out to silence the alarm and sat up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavens, had she actually dreamt about…Qu Zhi?</span></p>
<p><b><i>Pei</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">[mfn]the sound of spitting due to anger[/mfn]</span><b><i>!</i></b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How unlucky!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She put on her slippers and pulled open the curtains to her French windows. Rays of bright sunlight poured into the room. She ran her fingers through her long hair as she ran her fingers through her long hair. Standing in front of the window, Zheng Baozhu stretched her arms. Turning her head, she saw an essay on the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the essay she had written when she was in third grade, but her mother had torn it to pieces. This did not deter little Zheng Baozhu. She used her tenacious willpower to continue fighting. She taped it back together and kept the essay to this day.</span></p>
