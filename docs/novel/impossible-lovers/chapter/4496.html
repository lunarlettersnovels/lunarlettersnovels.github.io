            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sniffing, Zheng Baozhu’s Alias</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABA Television Station’s morning show had a special feature on Starlight Farm. Zheng Baozhu’s Garden Hotel was quite famous at Starlight Farm, so the program team specially arranged a small interview for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to fit the image of a female entrepreneur, Zheng Baozhu specially wore a small white suit jacket today. Although the design was more formal, the fabric wasn’t a rigid suit fabric. Instead, it had a subtle, low-profile, and eye-catching look, and the cuffs were decorated with sparkling pearls. Zheng Baozhu blew her hair and paired it with pearl earrings. She put a shiny hair clip above her left ear and went downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t time for her appointment with the reporters, so she went to the restaurant to have breakfast. Just as she sat down, Qu Zhi came down from upstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had just returned home yesterday. The jet lag hadn’t been reversed yet, but his spirits were pretty good. He had already changed the beige trench coat from yesterday and replaced it with a slim coat. With it left unbuttoned, a light sweater, shirt and tie were revealed, and a white shirt and tie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This outfit displayed his already superior long legs even more vividly. As soon as he came over, the surrounding people’s gazes, intentionally or unintentionally, fell on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liang Huihui saw him and immediately greeted him with a smile. “Mr. Qu, you’re here. Would you like something to eat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you have?” He bent his head and saw Zheng Baozhu sitting there eating. Zheng Baozhu pretended not to see him, as she gracefully fed the egg to her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi said, “I want a portion of the steamed egg Zheng Baozhu has.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay!” Liang Huihui warmly introduced it to Qu Zhi. “This steamed egg is our restaurant’s signature. Miss Baozhu eats it every day!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really?” He took a seat and ordered a glass of milk and a sandwich.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu had only eaten a bowl of steamed eggs and a few small tomatoes this morning. When Liang Huihui came to deliver Qu Zhi’s meal, she asked with concern, “Miss Baozhu, is that all you’ve eaten today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an old employee of the restaurant, Liang Huihui had a good understanding of Zheng Baozhu’s appetite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu picked up a paper towel and wiped the corner of her mouth. She took out a piece of red makeup from her bag and said, “I have an interview later. It’s not good to eat too much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she said that, someone came to tell her about the reporters. She quickly put away her lipstick and left in her high heels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the hotel, there was a reading corner specially made by Zheng Baozhu. There were a few rows of bookshelves, some green, potted plants, and a few small tables. The layout was fresh and elegant. However, very few guests came here to read books. After all, those who came out to play preferred to take photos at the scenic spots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interview venue was set here. By the time Zheng Baozhu arrived, the lights had already been set up. The person in charge of interviewing her was a female reporter. When she saw Zheng Baozhu, she greeted her warmly,” Hello, Boss Zheng.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu covered her lips with a smile. She looked at her and said, “Hey, hey, Boss Zheng, you’re so xenophobic. Just call me Miss Baozhu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……” The reporter smiled and nodded.” Alright, Miss Baozhu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finishing his breakfast, he saw Zheng Baozhu sitting there in an interview. He raised his eyebrows and stopped to take a look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reporter sat opposite and asked her with a smile, “How did Miss Baozhu get the money to start a business?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu replied with a smile, “Oh, it was during the year of the third summer holiday. I spent two months of my summer work salary and bought my father the latest model of my phone as a birthday gift.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then my father was so happy that he gave me a car for my birthday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think I need such a good car as a student. I just sold this car and started a business with the money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “……” reporter chuckled. “This is truly an interesting experience, haha.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi snorted mockingly and walked out of the hotel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he left, the reporter asked, “Then how did you earn your first bucket of gold?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu said,” I opened a milk tea shop near the school. Back then, the milk tea industry wasn’t as saturated as it has been in the past few years. Basically, it could make easy money. I also made some small investments with the senior students of the finance department and earned some money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reporter nodded as she listened intently. “That means you still have a good eye for investment. From what I understand, you’ve mainly stayed in the food and beverage industry? Your hotel is famous for its good food.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu smiled and said,” At that time, I made a lot of money by opening a milk tea shop. I wanted to do something big, so I tried to open a Chinese restaurant. The business was pretty good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In your opinion, what’s the most important thing about catering?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Bao Zhu said, “Perhaps most people would think that the most important thing in catering is the dishes. The dishes and the environment are indeed very important. But in my opinion, to run a good restaurant, the most important thing is the management of the staff. And this is also the hardest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you encounter any difficulties back then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, the opening of a new restaurant, from site selection, renovation, hype, and post-promotion, required attention every step of the way. Each point could drive people crazy. The training and management of the staff were even more important. Not every staff member could take the initiative to work. Some people wouldn’t be able to do well even if they were to keep an eye on him…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu was able to talk to the reporters non-stop. “If a restaurant could continue to operate as long as the dishes were good, then why wouldn’t the chef set up his own restaurant instead of working in yours?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reporter nodded in agreement.” That makes sense. I’ve heard a saying before that if ten chefs go out to open a restaurant, nine will close down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu laughed and said to her, “That’s something that I have a lot of say in. The chef of my first restaurant quit his job and went to set up his own shop. I was also in a bad mood at that time and started to learn how to cook ……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interview lasted for half an hour. After the reporter finished chatting with Zheng Baozhu, she had a new understanding of her. “To be honest, at first, I felt that you didn’t look reliable, but after chatting, I realized that you actually had your own ideas and dared to try. Your experience seems to be smooth sailing, but starting a business isn’t actually all that easy. You’re just a bit luckier than the others. In the end, you’ve only come to this point because you’re determined to persevere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu sniffled and looked like she was on the verge of tears. “Who says it’s not difficult? The world is always biased against rich, beautiful women. They’ve all suffered.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporter: “……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wanted to take back her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No matter what, I’m still very happy to be able to interview you today. I wish you a better career.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you.”</span></p>
