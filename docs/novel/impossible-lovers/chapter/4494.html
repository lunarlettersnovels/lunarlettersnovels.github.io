            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Great Beauty by the Window</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Science Park apartment complex for the high-end talent community would have its official grand opening on Saturday. Zheng Baozhu had paid attention to these buildings since the beginning of their construction. Most developers these days simply had to complete the ground floor in order to secure a pre-sale permit. Then they would be able to sell units while construction was ongoing. These, however, were not placed on the market until construction was completed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buildings in the high-end talent residential area were beautifully built, all with single-unit floors. Zheng Baozhu had watched as they were constructed little by little. Now that they were about to hit the market, she just had to join in on the fun. The complex’s real estate agency had only been completed within the past two months. During this time, people occasionally came to enquire about the area. The real estate office was located near Starlight Park. After getting in her car, Zheng Baozhu changed into a pair of flats and stepped on the clutch. The car drove smoothly out of the garage, shining like a ruby in the light of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it was not yet the official opening day, few people were working in the office. After Zheng Baozhu parked, she slipped back into her high heels and walked out with her bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The salesperson closest to the door saw her walk over and took the initiative to greet her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, madam. How can I help you today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu looked at the young woman. She seemed to be around her own age. She wore a uniform and had tied her hair neatly at the back of her head. Zheng Baozhu judged her to be capable and professional. Zheng Baozhu smiled and stopped to say, “I heard that the complex will open on Saturday. I’d like to know more about the property.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sand table in the middle of the office intrigued her. The saleswoman led her over to what turned out to be a model of the complex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from the elegant name “High-End Talent Community,” there was also an even more formal name for this complex: Jin Yu Man Tang. Zheng Baozhu felt that this name elevated the complex even further. One could say that it was rich in both knowledge and wealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She liked it when she heard it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area surrounding the complex had been as beautifully constructed as the buildings themselves. According to the sand table, there were twelve buildings in total. Their arrangement had been carefully planned. Each unit had an unobstructed view. Moreover, the space between the buildings was wide, and there was a lot of outdoor space in the complex. Most importantly, the building was in a prime location. It was built next to Starlight Park. From the balcony of the higher units, one could overlook most of Starlight Park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no doubt that the government prioritized attracting talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard one must have an invitation to purchase a unit. Is this correct?” Zeng Baozhu asked while thinking to herself, “It’s interesting. Other properties use a lottery system. To own this property, one must first have the right degree.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who said that studying was useless?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saleswoman nodded and explained to her, “The first batch is mainly open to people who meet the high-end talent policy. However, we will also add a second batch in the future. The second batch is for people from the public. If you are interested, you can register with us first. When the time comes, we will notify you by phone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh…” Zheng Baozhu nodded thoughtfully. “What about the second batch? Will it just be the unwanted units left over from the first batch?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The salesperson smiled and said, “I wouldn’t say that. Buying a house is like finding a soulmate. You won’t necessarily like what others do. They key is to find one that suits you, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu blinked. “As expected of a real estate consultant, you are quite eloquent. I envy your boss for having such an employee.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re too kind,” said the saleswoman politely and modestly. She gestured for Zheng Baozhu to sit on a nearby sofa and said, “You can fill out this form first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Great.” Zheng Baozhu took the pen and lowered her head to fill in the information. In addition to some basic information, this form also required your occupation and annual salary. However, it did not require a bank deposit certificate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Regarding this form, will there be further review after its submission?” Zheng Baozhu raised her eyes to look at the saleswoman beside her. “Are you qualified to buy the second batch only after passing the examination?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The salesperson smiled and said, “We’re just trying to understand the basic situation of our customers. Of course, we’ll also be screening them to determine the good matches. After all, the people living here are all at a higher level.” She glanced at Zheng Baozhu’s information and continued, “A female entrepreneur like you is definitely a qualified candidate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu liked this real estate consultant even more. After all, she was one of the few people to call her a “female entrepreneur.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She filled out the form and took a copy of the building information before driving back. When she returned to the hotel, Zheng Baozhu saw the time and went straight to the restaurant for lunch. When the hotel had many guests, she would order two dishes from the kitchen to be sent to her room. However, during the current low season, she preferred to eat in the restaurant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she reached the Chinese restaurant, Zheng Baozhu sat down in a seat by the window. The row of seats in front of the French window was next to the hotel garden. The garden was managed by a gardener all year round. The landscape was very beautiful. Usually, the seats on this side had to be booked in advance. Even Zheng Baozhu could only enjoy it a few times a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long after her order arrived, Qu Zhi and Qi Sheng walked in.</span></p>
