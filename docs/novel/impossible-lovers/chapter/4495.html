            <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sniffing, Zheng Baozhu’s Alias</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Zheng Baozhu was still giving an interview, Qu Zhi had already arrived at the Science Park. As soon as he entered, he heard his colleague Qi Sheng calling him behind him,” Old Qu—!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi turned around and saw him running over, panting. Then, he continued walking forward. Qi Sheng continued chasing after him, his mouth constantly moving. “Hey, slow down. Don’t bully people just because your legs are long!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He ignored him. Qi Sheng finally caught up and walked side by side. “Did you see your childhood sweetheart yesterday?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People who grew up together are called childhood sweethearts,” he corrected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fine, fine, fine. You’re already staying at her place, so why are you being pretentious?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi corrected him again. “At first, it was only because Auntie Su was so kind that I went there. Later, it was because Zheng Baozhu deliberately said that there was no room ……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re actually fighting with someone else?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not that. The DNA in my body moved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……” Qi Sheng was silent for a moment and patted his shoulder meaningfully. “Old Qu, don’t you think you’re childish?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi expressionlessly pinched the hand on his shoulder. “I don’t think so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qi Sheng smiled carelessly while digging for gossip, “Tell me more about your green plum… Zheng Baozhu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you know the Xiuxiu? It loves everything that sparkles and wishes she can hang all the gold, silver, and jewels on itself. Another name for this creature is Zheng Baozhu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qi Sheng:”……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I haven’t seen her for so many years, but she still looks the same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plastic surgery?“ Qi Sheng noticed the slip in his words. “That’s just praising her beauty!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……” Qu Zhi was silent for a moment before turning to look at Qi Sheng. “She doesn’t have a mind or soul, yet there are reporters interviewing her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qi Sheng was even more interested. “What? Tell me about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi walked into the office with him and leaned forward for the attendance machine to scan his face. When I left the office this morning, I happened to see a reporter interviewing her. He asked her how the start-up fund came about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did she get here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She sold the luxury car that her father gave her in exchange for money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pfft.” Qi Sheng chuckled and also scanned his face at the attendance machine. “Isn’t that quite bold?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bold?“ He walked straight to the locker room, took off his coat, and hung it up. He took out a white coat and said, “When she was in junior high school, she couldn’t find the keys to her bike, so she took the car out of the garage and was caught as a car thief. Is that also daring?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qi Sheng looked like he was about to burst out laughing. “No, the more you talk, the more I find this girl interesting. I think it’s you who doesn’t have a soul.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi snorted and coldly looked at him. “It’s not strange for a fool like you to resonate with her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……” Qi Sheng clicked his tongue and put on his uniform. “I think you’re biased against a pretty girl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not prejudiced. Who would take the car out?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qi Sheng said, “Then what would you do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qu Zhi closed the cabinet door, looked at him, and said, “I would explain the situation to the teacher and ask him to call a locksmith. If I still couldn’t get it unlocked, I could at least borrow a hydraulic clamp.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Achoo!“ Zheng Baozhu was holding her phone with one shoulder as she rummaged through the closet. “Tong Tong, you can make your own decisions about cleaning up after Qu Zhi. I’m busy looking for the car keys.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cen Tong was making a fuss over the phone. “You can’t find your keys again? Do you remember when you were treated as a thief in junior high school?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Zheng Baozhu remembered. She picked up her phone and sat down on the sofa, chatting with Cen Tong. “I was angry about this for a long time. Not only did Qu Zhi not help me testify, he even said some sarcastic remarks to the side. He would go to the teacher to help him if I said anything about him. Heh, I’m laughing to death. I’m telling you, the reason he studied so hard was so he’d have an excuse to go look for the teachers. Who would look for a teacher for such a trivial matter? But Qu Zhi would because he knew that the teacher liked him and was willing to help. He still looks down on my love for money. If I love money, what he loves is a privilege!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not how it works……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why not? Take the high-end talent area promoted by the government, for example. If you want to buy it, you have to have an invitation letter. Once he returns, he immediately gets it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then he obtained with his ability ……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, I know that. I’m talking about his hypocritical face. He clearly wants to enjoy special treatment, but he still pretends to be aloof. He said that it was for the sake of his country and the people. Heh, hypocrisy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……” Cen Tong Tong didn’t know what to say. “Your prejudice really is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zheng Baozhu lay on the sofa and saw the car keys under the table. “Alright, I’m done talking. I found the keys.”</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">✯✯✯</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The author had something to say:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The male and female leads are at a stage where they have a misunderstanding of each other but feel that they knew each other very well…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, they will gain a new understanding of each other. I hope that everyone will give them some time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main themes of this novel is that you should not label or judge others.</span></p>
