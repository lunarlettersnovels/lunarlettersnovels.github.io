            <p><strong>Chapter 135</strong></p>
<p>“Yes,” said the maid, hesitantly.</p>
<p>“How did it happen?” asked the count, “Perhaps it’s a mistake!”</p>
<p>“No,” said the maid, “The temple identified and verified that it was him.”</p>
<p>The temple was never wrong in verifying the dead. All guides of god rested in the temple in their tombs.</p>
<p>“How did he die?” asked the count.</p>
<p>“It is… uncertain,” said the maid, “Some say it was an accident. His carriage overturned and crushed him. Some say he fell into a river. Nobody seems to know for certain, but everybody saw his corpse.”</p>
<p>Count Glacia could only think of one person who could have made it happen. “Duke Skad!” she exclaimed. Only he was capable of something like this. It was something he would do.</p>
<p><em>Did he really kill Dajal because he crossed his wife? </em>Wondered count Glacia, <em>it can’t be! Is the duke really sincere about his feelings towards…? </em>Count Glacia wrapped her arms around herself as she suddenly felt a chill down her spine. It felt like the end of Dajal was a warning to her, too.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lunia reported the happenings of the ball of the previous night to Amethyst since she had left very early.</p>
<p>“The praise for last night’s ball is endless,” said Lunia, “Everyone compliments you on doing such a good job with it.”</p>
<p>“I am glad everyone enjoyed it,” said Amethyst, absentmindedly. She wasn’t really listening to Lunia. She looked at Habe who stood attentively with the other maids, with her head bowed. She looked downright miserable. Amethyst was concerned about her bruised face and injured lower lip.</p>
<p><em>So, it was Habe after all</em>, thought Amethyst sadly. She had been suspicious since Habe had asked about her favorite flower before count Glacia bought all the baby’s breath. But she still felt bitter seeing Habe so miserable.</p>
<p>As the Lady of the Household, Amethyst had banned the use of violence in the mansion after firing Dajal. Any kind of violence was intolerable to her. However, it was clear that Habe had been beaten. And there was only one person who could have done it. Someone who was furious that her plans were failing. The one who had approached Habe for personal information about her.</p>
<p><em>Habe is foolish to sell out information in this manner but count Glacia needs to be dealt with. How dare she lay a hand on my people? </em>Amethyst seethed in anger. As an employer, it fell on her to make sure her employees felt safe.</p>
<p>“Habe,” she called.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam?” said Habe raising her lowered head in surprise.</p>
<p>“Why is your face bruised?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>All the maids, including Roman and Lunia turned to Habe. “I… I fell down and got hurt, madam,” stammered Habe.</p>
<p>“Lunia?” called Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam?” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“Do those bruises look like the ones you get when you fall down?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“No, madam,” said Lunia, “If she had fallen, her skin would have been scraped rather than turn blue like that.”</p>
<p>“Hm,” said Amethyst, “Habe? Do you have anything more to add?”</p>
<p>“I am sorry, madam,” said Habe, “I misspoke. I bumped into something. I wasn’t looking…” Se trailed off. She knew it was futile.</p>
<p>“Habe, it’s a little too far-fetched that your lips got busted so badly just by bumping into something,” said Amethyst, sadly. “If you feel uncomfortable uttering it, shall I venture a guess?”</p>
<p>Habe looked down, anxiously. Her knuckles white.</p>
<p>“You sold my information to Count Glacia, didn’t you?” asked Amethyst, calmly. “You told her about the attire I was going to wear for the ball. When I opted for another attire in the last minute, she was enraged and raised her hands on you. Am I wrong so far?”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s not true,” stammered Habe.</p>
<p>“I take it that it was you who told her about my favorite flower?” said Amethyst, “And other… personal matters. What did Count Glacia offer you in return?”</p>
<p>Habe saw that it was useless to deny it since Amethyst was so calm and sure of everything she said at that instant. Habe dropped to her knees and sobbed. “Please forgive me, madam,” she pleaded, “Just this once.”</p>
<p>“Tell me the truth, Habe,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“All of it is true. Whatever you said,” sobbed Habe, “She told me that it would be simple and harmless information. She said it would never hurt you. I was a fool. I will never do something like this again. So, please forgive me this once.”</p>
<p>“What did she offer you in return?” asked Amethyst again.</p>
<p>“A necklace and a brooch,” said Habe.</p>
<p>“Did she give it to you herself?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Habe, “She gave me the ones she was wearing at that time. She said it suited me better.”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Amethyst, calmly. “Do you still have them?”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said Habe with bowed head, crying.</p>
<p>Amethyst turned to Lunia. “Remind me,” said Amethyst, “What did I say the punishment for violence would be?”</p>
<p>“Immediate dismissal,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“Hm,” pondered Amethyst, “Can this be applied to the extended household members?”</p>
