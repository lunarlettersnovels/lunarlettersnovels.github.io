<p>“Roman, please call the ladies now,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said Roman and ran off. After a while, she ushered the ladies to the garden.</p>
<p>“Oh my! What is all this?”</p>
<p>“Countess Citri, welcome!” said Amethyst, “I thought we could continue with our camping trip that we had to leave so suddenly.”</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” said Amethyst, “are you disappointed?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not!” said Countess Citri, hugging Amethyst. After they had been shouted at by the duke, she had been worried about Amethyst. She had seen that it had upset the duchess more than the others.</p>
<p>“Lady Skad!”</p>
<p>“Countess Onslow, Baroness Renove, welcome!”</p>
<p>“What is all this?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to sleep here today?”</p>
<p>“Is this a sequel to yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amethyst, “If you could consider it so, then I’d be grateful. So, what do you say?”</p>
<p>“We love it!”</p>
<p>“Then please change into something comfortable,” said Amethyst, “I’ve laid out some comfortable clothes inside the tent.”</p>
<p>“Alright! Thank you so much.”</p>
<p>Soon Baroness Hours and Countess Zephyr arrived at the garden as well.</p>
<p>“Oh my! Lady Skad, when did you prepare all this?”</p>
<p>“I had plenty of help. Now, please change!” The ladies obliged. They changed into comfortable attires and gathered around the campfire.</p>
<p>“The food is already set behind, on that table,” said Amethyst, gesturing to the table loaded with food. “Please feel free to eat whenever you want.”</p>
<p>Countess Zephyr turned around to look. “Wow, you’ve prepared so much.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” said Amethyst, “Since I have prepared so much, you must eat a lot, Sienna! Don’t hold back.”</p>
<p>“Ha ha ha. Okay Amethyst.”</p>
<p>“This is rather nice? Right, Maria?”</p>
<p>“Yes! I wonder why we didn’t think of it before?”</p>
<p>“It may be a garden…but it’s nice.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think it’s nicer because it’s with you all.” Countess Onslow looked up at the sky with a smile and others did the same.</p>
<p>“Wow! The stars are already showing!”</p>
<p>“I think there will be plenty to see on a day like this.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I hope so.”</p>
<p>Roman passed out a shawl to each of the ladies. “It’ll start to get chilly once the sun sets. So please be careful not to catch a cold.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, thank you Roman,” Countess Citri replied with a smile.</p>
<p>“Your maid is so observant and considerate.” She said to Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes, she’s someone I treasure a lot,” said Amethyst smiling at Roman, who in return, looked flustered at the compliment.</p>
<p>With a cup of warm tea in hand, everyone looked up at the starry sky. Even though not much was said, it was evident that everyone felt at peace. It was a meaningful day where their friendship became stronger.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It had been ten days since Alexcent had left for the hunting competition. It was about time for the match to end and for him to come back home. But there was no news of it. Amethyst felt uneasy.</p>
<p><em>Did something happen? Did he get hurt? No, someone would have informed me, or he would have been back, </em>she thought. <em>Or is it because he is still angry at me and doesn’t want to come back?</em></p>
<p>Days passed like this with anxious thoughts filling her mind. Amethyst waited for him anxiously. She wasn’t the only one. The other ladies felt worried about their husbands as well. <em>If they had departed for the mansion, the news would have already travelled.</em> She put down her spoon.</p>
<p>Soon the entire mansion was affected by Amethyst’s mood. Nobody seemed to be in high spirits. The staff carried out their duties diligently and kept quiet. Then two days later, Pon sought Amethyst out.</p>
<p>“Madam!” he called.</p>
<p>“Yes, Pon?” said Amethyst. She was in the garden, drinking tea with the other ladies.</p>
<p>“I have received news that the duke has left the hunting ground with the other nobles,” said Pon, “They are heading back to the mansion.”</p>
<p>“Really?!” relief flooded through Amethyst, and so was it for the other ladies.</p>
<p>“Yes!” said Pon.</p>
<p>“Is anyone injured? Is everyone fine?”</p>
<p>“There was no mention of any injury,” said Pon, “So I’m sure they are all safe.”</p>
<p>“When are they expected to arrive?”</p>
<p>“Earliest tomorrow afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow…alright.” Amethyst felt sulky at the mention of tomorrow instead of today.</p>
<p>“But what a relief that they are all coming back safely, Lady Skad!” Countess Onslow squeezed Amethyst’s hand in comfort.</p>
<p>“Yes…” said Amethyst but she still couldn’t help but worry. When she had parted ways with Alexcent, he had been furious at her. She had written him an apology letter, but she didn’t know if he would forgive her.</p>
<p>Soon the news about the duke’s party and their return spread through the mansion. There was also a change, he would be arriving sooner than expected. So, around dinnertime, Amethyst prepared herself to meet him on his return.</p>
