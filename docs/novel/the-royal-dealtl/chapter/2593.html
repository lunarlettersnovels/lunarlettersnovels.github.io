            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 79</strong></p>
<p>A few hours ago…</p>
<p>Many of the merchants gathered before the duke’s mansion were chatting, waiting for their turn. Dunph was just watching silently, not being caught in the various conversations.</p>
<p>“I heard the new duchess called him in today,” someone said.</p>
<p>“I see. He’ll see a lot of money today since it’s the great duke’s family.”</p>
<p>“Well… that’d be great and all, but not too long ago he went to the earl’s residence and came back empty-handed.” Another remarked.</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t put a jinx on him. Since when is the earl and duke the same?”</p>
<p>“Haha, if you say so.”</p>
<p>“Just wait and see. The maids passing by said they’ll be buying a lot.”</p>
<p>“Then should we get our hopes up today?”</p>
<p>They were all owners of high-end shops but were only merchants. However, Dunph was simply waiting to see, not expecting much.</p>
<p>All these merchants dealt in items that wives of aristocrats could purchase, but each was different.</p>
<p><em>Who buys precious metals like they’re shopping at a grocery store?</em></p>
<p>It was Diana Jewels that dealt only with the most precious jewels in the kingdom. Thanks to that, many were used to leaving empty-handed.</p>
<p><em>If it’s a new duchess, you know it’s going to be cliché… At best, maybe some earrings? Today will just end up being a fruitless attempt. So we can leave soon. It’s boring to just wait around.</em></p>
<p>Right then, someone found and interrupted Dunph’s musings.</p>
<p>※</p>
<p>“Why is it so chaotic?”</p>
<p>Alexcent was in the office taking care of business. He was sorting through documents and trying to remain focused, but the ruckus from outside was getting on his nerves.</p>
<p>As he poured a cup of tea, Pon said, “Lady Amethyst called the shop merchants today.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?” Alexcent was visibly surrpised.</p>
<p>“Yes Sir.”</p>
<p>“Hmmmm—”</p>
<p><em>But why? I can see the numbers clearly. Then she has to live up to it.</em></p>
<p>Alexcent, who was thinking hard about something, asked with a smirk, “And is a jeweler here?”</p>
<p>“Yes Sir. All the prestigious merchants of the kingdom, including Aarst, have been brought together.”</p>
<p>“Then bring them in. Only the prestigious ones.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
<p>A little while later, Butler Pon returned to the office with Dunph by his side.</p>
<p>“Pleased to meet you, Your Excellency. I am Dunph, from Diana Jewels.” The man greeted politely.</p>
<p>“Diana Jewels?”</p>
<p>“Yes Sir.”</p>
<p>Alexcent moved over to the meeting table and told him, “Come have a seat.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you.”</p>
<p>“So, do you have anything to present to me?”</p>
<p>“Beg your pardon, Sir?” Dunph was puzzled.</p>
<p>“You said you’re a jeweler. As a merchant, didn’t you come here to sell stuff?” Alexcent flatly said.</p>
<p>“That is correct, Sir… I thought I’d be meeting Lady Amethyst.”</p>
<p>“Obviously you’ll be seeing her too, but you know who it’s better to deal with.”</p>
<p>“I see. Please wait a moment.”</p>
<p>Dunph hurried his staff to display the items on the table he brought today.</p>
<p><em>What a tyranny! I thought I’d be seeing the duchess today, I didn’t expect Duke du Skad! There’s no way I’ll be leaving empty-handed today.</em></p>
<p>However, no matter how aristocratic one may be, the head of the family never bought jewelry for his wife. Dunph had meticulously chosen only the items worth selling today- high-ranking, though not top-class.</p>
<p>Alexcent studied the jewels on display, then said with great courage, “Dammit, this is disappointing. I can’t believe this is all.”</p>
<p>“Beg your pardon?!”The duke’s reaction was beyond Dunph’s imagination.</p>
<p>“I had quite the expectation because you are a prestigious merchant, but now I’m quite disappointed. I am done here. You can go.”</p>
<p>“Hold on…! Wait, please. I was unaware, my lord, that you’d be here. My apologies.” Dunph scurried to present a top-class jewel, all the while carefully reading the environment.</p>
<p>“Now we’re talking!” Alexcent said, feeling relieved.</p>
<p>Dunph then steadily showed him more jewels. “How about these? They are the best items we have in our jewelry store. If there’s something that meets your desire, please let me know.”</p>
<p>The duke, after carefully looking through then, tossed out carelessly, “Well… I’m not saying I’m ecstatic at your… collection. This is it?”</p>
<p>“These are all of our top-class items, Sir. It will be hard to find these kinds of jewels anywhere else in all of the kingdom.”</p>
<p><em>What the… Why are you being so picky and curious when you don’t want to buy anything!? It won’t be easy to buy these kinds of high-quality jewels anywhere else. </em>Dunph was reminded by Alexcent’s incessant comments that yes, this was a fruitless attempt.</p>
<p>“To say these are top-class, they certainly are, but I don’t think they’re real. Do you think I like playing games?”</p>
<p>“Pardon? How dare you say such a thing?” Dunph took a short breather, then continued. “Can you wait just a little longer?”</p>
<p>He left the office for a while, seeking for the duke’s cooperation. And when he returned, he was carrying a small safe.</p>
<p>Perhaps Alexcent had been bored while waiting, he was toying around with the other jewels on the table that he had left unattended.</p>
<p>“Duke du Skad!” Frightened, Dunph hurriedly collected the jewels rolling around on the table and neatly placed them in the box.</p>
<p>Alexcent only shrugged his shoulders comically.</p>
<p>“This has been passed down from generation to generation. The best of the… No, this jewel cannot be graded, so it’s been rejected every year at the auction—”</p>
<p>“I’ll be the judge of that.”</p>
<p>“Right. And—”</p>
<p>He opened the safe and pulled out a small box from inside. After carefully opening it, the gem, known as the Goddess’s Eye, a fiery red color beyond any imagination, flaunted its masterful and brilliance.</p>
<p>“Good… good. This is the one.”</p>
