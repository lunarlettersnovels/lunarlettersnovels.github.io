            <p><strong>Chapter 109 – Tea Party (2)</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the large conference hall in the mansion, a heated debate was in progress. Alexcent hadn’t uttered a word since the meeting started but listened quietly to whatever others had to say.</p>
<p>“Due to the frequent flood and storms, the amount of harvest was disappointing this year. It had decreased by 30% as compared to the year before. So we were wondering if we could reduce the tax rate for the citizens who are farmers.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean reduce! Then the overall budget will reduce. How are we to make up for the loss in our budgetary estimate?”</p>
<p>“Well, we could split it up and charge it to the new companies and projects we are starting.”</p>
<p>“What? How can we raise the taxes even before the business is in operation.”</p>
<p>“Baron Zephyr, you wouldn’t understand since you do not have many farms in your custody. But for Count Onslow and myself, our areas did not have a good harvest this year. So, if we were to collect a large amount in taxes, it could harm the citizens and they might mutiny.”</p>
<p>“Even so, how can we charge that to the other businesses. Do you think anyone would invest? If not, then all the factories will close without any investment.”</p>
<p>As Count Citri and Baron Zephyr raised their differing points, Count Onslow, Baron Hours, Baron Piamon took sides and added their two cents to the discussion.</p>
<p>“Now, please calm down. At this rate, we will get nowhere,” said Count Renove.</p>
<p>Gen, on the other hand, wondered why the Duke was so distant. He seemed to be listening but really far away from whatever the other nobles were discussing. Just then, there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>There was another knock. When no one answered, Lunia pushed the door open and entered. She bowed and approached Alexcent. She bent over and whispered something in his ear. Nobody else heard. Alexcent nodded.</p>
<p>“Madam has just woken up,” whispered Lunia to Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Besides the hangover she seems fine,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“The medicine?” asked Alexcent. He knew that she hated anything bitter so she might have bypassed the bitter medicine.</p>
<p>“She drank it all, and fell back asleep,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>Alexcent nodded, and Lunia bowed and took her leave from the conference hall.</p>
<p>Alexcent’s mood seemed to improve a little. He didn’t look so distant anymore. He wanted to check on her at once, but he needed to finish this work. His relatives were all in a heated debate now and it was just the first day of the meeting. He sighed.</p>
<p>“Taxes are to remain frozen. Same as this year without any increase,” declared Alexcent, “Provided that temporary compensation shall be paid to the affected farmers and other residents.”</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lord,” said the nobles.</p>
<p>The solution seemed absurdly simple and nobody could oppose Alexcent’s suggestion. The nobles felt embarrassed for their heated outbursts from earlier.</p>
<p>“Which budget should we use to cover temporary compensation?” asked Count Glacia.</p>
<p>Alexcent had seemed in a foul mood from the beginning. Count Glacia had been bothered by Alexcent’s aloofness but now he looked a little better after Lunia left, so she took it as a chance to ask her question.</p>
<p>“From the reserves we’ve been building up,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>“Next, discussing the breakdown of the advertising and promotional costs for Brandy,” insisted Baron Piamon, cautiously.</p>
<p>“Rejected,” said Alexcent curtly.</p>
<p>Baron Piamon looked like he was going to burst into tears any second.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Roman, could you call Lunia for me?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>After waking up from her nap, Amethyst ate the meal that Roman had brought up to her room and looked for Lunia. Yesterday’s events were a thing of the past now. The head of the other families were having a meeting and she must play her part as well.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling any better?” asked Lunia, hurrying into the room.</p>
<p>“Yes. Thanks to you.” Amethyst smiled sheepishly at Lunia. Lunia was busy checking her for fever, taking her temperature.</p>
<p>“Lunia.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“How are the other ladies? Is there anyone who is not well?”</p>
<p>“Thankfully, they are all fine.”</p>
<p>“Mmm….Then shall we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?”</p>
<p>“So soon? Will you be alright?”</p>
<p>“Let’s have tea and simple snacks or cakes,” suggested Amethyst, “The main objective will probably be to talk and make everyone feel comfortable. So instead of postponing it, I think it will be best to get it over with…before the other ladies feel neglected.”</p>
<p>“Understood,” said Lunia, “Where should we have the tea party?”</p>
<p>“Hm…,” pondered Amethyst. <em>The garden would be great… but it’s too big and will probably take a lot of time to prepare it for the tea party. It might not be ready by tomorrow. Also, it might rain. But I don’t want to do it indoors. It’s too formal. I would like it to be somewhere small and cozy…</em></p>
<p>“What about the glass garden?” suggested Roman.</p>
<p>“Glass garden?” considered Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes. the glass garden that exists between the building where the guests currently are and the main mansion.”</p>
<p><em>Hm, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>it’s cozy and sheltered…</em></p>
<p>“Great idea, Roman! Let’s go with that.”</p>
<p>Amethyst felt proud of Roman. After taking over as a manager of the household, she seemed to have dedicated her time to learn everything about the estate grounds. Roman had come a long way.</p>
<p>“Madam, most of the plants are green in the glass garden,” said Roman, “So it would probably need some decoration. Do you have any theme in mind?”</p>
<p>“What about flowers? We don’t need a concept, just something natural,” said Amethyst, “But the flowers should be plentiful and abundant. The color can be in pastel tone to give it a calm and tranquil effect, and the cutlery can be small and cute. How does that sound?”</p>
<p>Lunia nodded. “It sounds good. It suits your image as well. I will purchase the necessary flowers for the tea party. Then prepare the invitations and send it out as soon as it is ready.”</p>
<p>“Ah, now that you mention an invitation. Are you planning on sending a paper card?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, a lot of people do it in general.”</p>
<p>“I was thinking… the tea party might be a little bland, so for the invitation I’d like it to be a little special.”</p>
<p>“How Madam?”</p>
