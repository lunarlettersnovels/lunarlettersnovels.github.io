            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 62</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps it was because she felt bad that she didn’t manage to catch him yesterday as she was angry at him. For some reason, unlike most days, she wanted to greet him at the entrance.</p>
<p><em>I guess surprising him like this from time to time is not too bad.</em></p>
<p>“Alec, how are you back so early today?”</p>
<p>Amethyst who was rushing towards Alexcent came to a stop as she spotted someone next to him.</p>
<p>It was Dajal, greeting her with his head bowed.</p>
<p>“Ah, Ash. I ended my tasks early today.”</p>
<p>Amethyst swallowed dryly and carefully approached Alexcent, when Dajal opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“I greet you for the first time Madam. I am Dajal in charge of the side estate.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>In case she got caught, she kept her answers as short as possible.</p>
<p><em>Damn, what is Dajal doing here?</em></p>
<p>Her entire head was a blank sheet.</p>
<p>“Wow, just like I’ve heard you are beautiful, Madam.” He continued to bow and kept at his insincere praises.</p>
<p><em>Does he not recognise me? Or is he pretending not to know?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst tried hard to read his thoughts.</p>
<p>“So, the maintenance fee for the estate is not enough?” Alexcent seemed unhappy with Dajal praising Amethyst as he stepped in before she could reply.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir. There was a heavy downpour recently and the ground collapse,” He solemnly replied.</p>
<p>“The rain was not to such extent.”</p>
<p>“It was a place with a weak foundation… so it has always been a weak spot.”</p>
<p>“All right, fine! Pon!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.” Pon said, “I will have it put in the budget.”</p>
<p>“This time fix it properly,” Alexcent said sharply.</p>
<p>“Not to worry, Sir.”</p>
<p><em>Collapse? In the side estate? Was there such a place? </em>As she was deep in thought, she saw Lunia coming her way. <em>Damn, why is Lunia here as well?</em></p>
<p>Lunia must have had the same thoughts as her expression crumbled momentarily before becoming composed behind a poker face.</p>
<p>Coincidentally Alexcent, Amethyst, Lunia, Pon, and Dajal were all gathered in one place at the entrance of the main mansion.</p>
<p>Lunia quickly greeted Alec. “Sir, Madam. I didn’t know you were both here.”</p>
<p>“What brings you here”</p>
<p>“I… was on my way to the side estate.”</p>
<p>Lunia glanced at Amethyst at Alexcen’t question.</p>
<p>“The side estate? You? What for?”</p>
<p>“I coincidentally ran into a maid from there and sent her on an errand… so on her behalf I was going to pass this to Sir Dajal.”</p>
<p>“Me?” Dajal asked incredulously.</p>
<p>“Yes. I had to send her on an urgent errand. She asked me to pass this to you.”</p>
<p>Lunia handed the ledger to Dajal.</p>
<p>Dajal accepted it and asked, “What was the name of the maid?”</p>
<p>“Carol… I think she said her name was Carol.”</p>
<p>Amethyst felt her neck stiffen.</p>
<p>“Carol?” Alexcent asked.</p>
<p>Dajal, Lunia, Amethyst all instantly looked towards Alexcent. There was tension in the air and no one dared to breathe.</p>
<p>“Yes… I think it was Carol.”</p>
<p>“Do you know this child?” The one to ask him that question was Dajal, but for some reason, Alexcent answered while looking at Amethyst.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“She is new but unfamiliar with things… so I am teaching her everything one by one.”</p>
<p>“Unfamiliar?” Alexcent mused.</p>
<p>“Yes. I heard she came from the countryside, so she is still too green and it takes time to teach her.” Dajal explained.</p>
<p>“So you are teaching her yourself?” Alexcent’s eyebrows quirked.</p>
<p>“Yes. Since everyone in the estate is busy… I should, of course, teach her. It’s nice and nostalgic, reminding me of the good old days. Hahaha.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Just because of one word that Alexcent said, Dajal rambled on.</p>
<p>Looking at how he was senselessly rambling on and on in front of Alexcent, he didn’t seem to have found out that the maid Carol was in fact the Lady of the House. Since she wasn’t one to catch people’s eyes, he didn’t seem to have made the connection that the woman next to Alexcent and the girl Carol were the one and the same. He was the shallow kind that judged people by their outward appearances.</p>
<p><em>Should I be relieved or offended?</em> Amethyst raged inwardly.</p>
<p><em>Wait a minute! If he doesn’t recognise me should I take things up a notch?</em></p>
<p>“Can I take a look at that ledger?”</p>
<p>Lunia squinted at Amethyst’s words. As if to ask secretly what she was up to. Amethyst tried her best to ignore Lunia and directed her gaze to Dajal.</p>
<p>“My Lady?” Dajal asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s originally my task but I feel bad that I’ve asked you to do it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, please don’t say such things. I’m sure you have so many things to do so how could you possibly pay attention to things like this?” he hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“I don’t have that many tasks. It’s mainly shopping,” Amethyst nonchalantly replied.</p>
<p>“Haha, But… .”</p>
<p>Dajal must have been uncomfortable in front of the prince, as he seemed reluctant to share the ledger. Not only was he not using the affiliated banks of the prince but he also didn’t seem to want to be caught choosing and trading with Aran Bank which had a bad reputation.</p>
