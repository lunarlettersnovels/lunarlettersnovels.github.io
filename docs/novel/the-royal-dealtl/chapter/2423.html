            <p><strong>Chapter 245</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent took the clothes given to him by the maid and looked at her questionably. The clothes appeared to be high quality and fairly fancy, especially compared to what he currently wore.</p>
<p>“Hurry! We don’t have much time,” the maid insisted.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Alexcent went into his lodging to change into the clothes, then returned to follow the maid into the mansion. It was the first time that Alexcent had been permitted into the mansion but, as he didn’t know why, he kept his eyes straight forward, rather than taking in his surroundings. Besides, he grew up in nobility. One mansion looked just like another.</p>
<p>They reached a closed door and the maid instructed him to wait. She approached the door and knocked loudly.</p>
<p>“Come in.” The feminine voice called from inside.</p>
<p>The maid opened the door and indicated for Alexcent to enter. “Go in. Don’t speak unless spoken to and only answer to what you are asked.”</p>
<p>Alexcent walked into the room. It was a lavishly decorated room, clearly designed for the rich. On a luxurious red sofa with golden ornamentation sat a woman with long pink hair. She looked stubborn and irritated, but there was also a hint of curiosity in her eyes.</p>
<p>“You are the slave that has been assigned to our house?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Alexcent answered.</p>
<p>“You definitely are handsome, like they have all been saying.” The woman had a wicked grin on her face. The maid beside Alexcent flinched slightly at Viyan’s words.</p>
<p>“What is your name, slave?” Viyan asked.</p>
<p>“24885,” Alexcent answered, making sure to only answer her direct questions.</p>
<p>“And where did you come from?”</p>
<p>Alexcent took a moment to answer. He didn’t know her intentions and wasn’t sure how much he wanted to reveal. He decided to be honest. “From Duke Roden’s household,” he finally answered.</p>
<p>“Duke Roden’s. I see. Thank you, you may leave now.” Viyan dismissed him as if this entire encounter was pointless.</p>
<p>Alexcent turned and left the bedroom, as the maid beside him let out a sigh of relief. As he waited in the hall, he could hear the woman and the maid discussing him.</p>
<p>“I like him,” Viyan stated.</p>
<p>“But, Miss!” The maid sounded shocked. “He’s a slave! This time, the master really won’t stand for it!”</p>
<p>“Oh, has father ever been angry with me? Don’t worry. I just have to speak sweetly and bat my puppy dog eyes at him if he gives me lip.”</p>
<p>“Miss….” The maid was insistent that Viyan not continue with this thought.</p>
<p>Viyan laughed. “All I have to say is that the slave tried to get with me. Understand? So, I have no worries about if I get caught.”</p>
<p>“The slave has shown no interest in any of the maids, even though some have tried to tempt him. His face is like stone. What makes you think you will be different?” the maid asked.</p>
<p>“Really?” Viyan seemed intrigued. “A challenge. I like him even more! Tell me, has there ever been a man who hasn’t been charmed by my looks? Do you seriously think that I can be compared to the maids? It might actually be easier since he’s a slave. That will be the fun of it.”</p>
<p>“Easier because he’s a slave?” the maid questioned.</p>
<p>“Slaves are easier to manipulate. If I treat him well, better than he’s been treated since he arrived here, he will be so charmed that he will be willing to give me anything that I ask.”</p>
<p>“I see.” The maid couldn’t argue with the facts.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was in the morning when the manipulations began. It started with Viyan summoning him to attend her in her bedroom, instead of the proper etiquette of only allowing him into her meeting room.</p>
<p>“I’m thirsty.” Viyan said, as she lounged in her bed. She placed a hand nonchalantly on Alexcent’s waist. Alexcent sighed, ignoring her hand, and poured a glass of water which he handed to her.</p>
<p>Viyan drank the water and spilled some down the front of her on purpose. “Oh no, I spilled,” she said, trying to sound surprised but not doing a good job with it. Alexcent took a handkerchief from the table and dabbed it on the moistened bed sheets. Viyan looked pleased and went back to reading her book.</p>
<p>Her eyes followed the letters on the page, without actually reading them. After a few minutes of the act, she put the book down, pulled back the sheets and stretched her legs. “I can’t focus on the book because my legs hurt,” she whined.</p>
<p>Viyan lifted the hem of her nightgown slightly. Alexcent stood still, ignoring the actions of the woman next to him.</p>
<p>Viyan nudged Alexcent, but he didn’t move and just continued staring forward. “What are you doing? I said my legs hurt.”</p>
<p>Alexcent turned towards her. Viyan lifted the hem of her dress a little more. Her silky legs had now been revealed up to her knees.</p>
<p>Alexcent looked Viyan in the eyes and simply said, “Stop.”</p>
<p>“What?” Viyan was not expecting that reaction.</p>
<p>“I’m a slave. I know very well what happens if I touch someone of status.”</p>
<p>Viyan now understood what the maids had meant when they said he looked at women like he was looking at a stone. She decided to reason with him. “I’m allowing it, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“I’m not all right with it,” He answered.</p>
<p>Viyan lifted her dress more, in frustration. Now the inside of her thigh was completely showing. “Rub it now!” she demanded.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to,” He was unwavering.</p>
<p>Viyan was furious. “What? You don’t want to?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Find someone else if you require this form of service.”</p>
