            <p><strong>Chapter 163</strong></p>
<p>His caresses made Amethyst moan and Alexcent lifted her up and took her to her bed. <em>How is he not angry at me for being jealous? </em>Amethyst wondered. <em>Am I allowed to be jealous? Please don’t give me hope.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst’s mind was full of questions and musings, but she couldn’t voice them out. As Alexcent tugged at her clothes, she spoke, “Alec, I am still angry at you.”</p>
<p>He groaned because he was already turned on. If he didn’t get to make love to her today, somebody would die. “What should I do to make it up to you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Embrace me, tenderly,” said Amethyst, “Until I am okay.” <em>So that I forget everything else and only remember you. </em>She blushed.</p>
<p>Alexcent grinned and whispered in her ears. “As you wish. That is exactly what I want.”</p>
<p>He leaned down and lifted her skirt. He stroked her slender legs and kissed her feet. He trailed his kissed slowly to her inner thigh. Finally, his lips reached her center and he kissed it.</p>
<p>Amethyst gasped and flinched at the sudden touch. She tried to squirm away, but his hand held her tight. She could feel his hot breath at her center from outside her underwear. His hands caressed her. She was already wet.</p>
<p>“I haven’t even got started and you are already wet,” said Alexcent with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“Don’t say that!” exclaimed Amethyst. He licked her and teased her over her underwear.</p>
<p>“Alec…mm,” mumbled Amethyst, “Stop.”</p>
<p>Amethyst looked down at him, he was still teasing her. She sat up and pushed him down. She got on top of him, with her legs on either side of his waist. She could see that he was already hard. She gyrated her hips at is waist.</p>
<p>Usually, she would have welcomed his caresses but not today. She needed it to be more stimulating, rough and passionate. <em>Is this too passionate? </em>She asked herself. <em>I want to feel so much pleasure so that everything else will be blinded by it.</em></p>
<p>She unbuttoned his pants and pulled it halfway down. She pulled his underwear down, revealing his bulge. Amethyst stroked it and grabbed it and brought it to her center. The sight aroused her even more. She had forgotten to take off her panties in a hurry. Normally, it would be Alexcent undressing her. She pulled her panties down getting ready for the act.</p>
<p>Alexcent folded his hands over his shoulder and propped his head on it, observing her flustered demeanor as though he was watching a spectacle. She had never initiated something like this before. This felt new to him. He was amused.</p>
<p>Amethyst felt daunted at the sight of his thing. She wasn’t able to make it enter her. “Alec, help me a little,” she implored.</p>
<p>But he didn’t budge. She was still staring at her with a smirk on his face, challenging her to figure it out on her own. She rubbed her thighs at his bugle, urging him. <em>Has she ever wanted him this much before? </em>Alexcent thought. He decided to enjoy the moment a little more.</p>
<p>Amethyst leaned down and kissed his chin. “Please,” she whispered. She then kissed him on his lips.</p>
<p>He could feel her wetness as she rubbed against him. Alexcent resolve was weakening as he heard her moan. “Alec, mm,” she whispered, “Please…”</p>
<p>Alexcent couldn’t take it anymore. He grabbed her behind and entered her. He held her tightly as she arched her back. A low scream-like moan escaped from her lips. She trembled as he filled her.</p>
<p>“Try moving,” he said, hoarsely, “Slowly.”</p>
<p>Amethyst heeded his instructions. She moved her hips up and lowered it slowly. She kept repeating the motion.</p>
<p>“Ah,” Alexcent groaned, “You are doing it right.” He moaned.</p>
<p>The praise mixed with his moans sent Amethyst reeling. She moved faster. The contact ignited a heat in her and both moans filled the room.</p>
<p>Amethyst still wasn’t satisfied. She wanted more. She took his thrusts faster and moved her hips harder. “Alec,” she mumbled as her strength gave away and she slouched forwards on him, trembling. “Alec,” she stammered, “I can’t hold on anymore.”</p>
<p>Alexcent sat up and embraced her. He held her and thrust his hips into her. Their lips found each other and kissed passionately. The only sound that filled the room was their rough breathing and the thrust of their bodies intertwined with each other.</p>
<p>Amethyst climaxed and slumped forward. “Ahhh,” she moaned. Alexcent stopped. He slid out of her and turned her around so that her back faced him.</p>
<p>“Alec,” she said.</p>
<p>“Just a little more,” he said.</p>
<p>“No!” she said and turned to face him.</p>
<p>Alexcent let her go at her sudden refusal. “Not like this,” she said, “I… today…”</p>
<p>He looked at her with concern wondering whether she had worn herself out.</p>
<p>“I want to look at you today,” she said, “I want to look at your face when you do it.”</p>
<p>Relieved, Alexcent obliged. He happily stole kisses from her lips as he thrust inside her and made her moan. This was Amethyst’s futile attempt to remind herself of herself. As long as she could look at him, she could fool herself that she was Amethyst.</p>
