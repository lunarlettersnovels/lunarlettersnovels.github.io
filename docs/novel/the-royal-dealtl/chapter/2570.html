            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 102</strong></p>
<p>Similar greetings were exchanged with everybody. The Baron and Baroness Houres seemed to be in their mid-forties, a little older than the Renoves.</p>
<p>The Baron Zephyr and his wife also appeared to be as young as the Renoves. Baron Piamon came alone. It seemed he was unmarried. He walked up to them and placed a chaste kiss on the back of Amethyst’ hand.</p>
<p>“It is indeed a great honor to meet the beautiful Lady Skad,” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh, you flatter me,” said Amethyst, smiling.</p>
<p>Alexcent frowned. Amethyst tried to wipe the back of her hands on her skirt when Baron Piamon wasn’t looking. Another carriage appeared with Count Citri and Countess, another carrying Onslow and the Countess, and finally Count of Glacia. The Onslows were the oldest, perhaps in their sixties.</p>
<p>“Greetings Lord and Lady Skad,” said Baron Onslow, “I am Onslow Skad and this is my wife.”</p>
<p>“Greetings Lady Skad, I am Maria,” said the Countess.</p>
<p>“Thank you for honoring us by being here,” said Amethyst, “I hope the journey wasn’t too rough.”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” said the Countess, “It is our honor to finally get to meet you.”</p>
<p>Afterwards, Count Citri and his wife, Countess Retegina exchanged greetings with them in similar manner. Count Citri, most recently appointed seemed the youngest of them all as did his wife, Countess Retegina. They seemed to be newlyweds too from the way they gazed at each other affectionately.</p>
<p>Count Citri and his wife stepped aside after their greetings, and a woman with glossy, black hair appeared before them eagerly. She was graceful and beautiful and emanated confidence. She smiled at them.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to meet you Lady Amethyst,” the woman said, “I am Count Glacia.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was taken aback for a while. She didn’t know a woman could be a Count. <em>Silly me, I shouldn’t be prejudiced. If the Emperor can be a female, why not a Count. </em>Amethyst smiled warmly at her.</p>
<p>“The honor is all mine to have met you, Count Glacia,” she said.</p>
<p>Count Glacia was a very beautiful and attractive woman, slender waist, pale skin and reddest lips Amethyst had ever seen. She radiated with elegance and confidence, that made her stand out amongst everyone else.</p>
<p>“Okay, now you have to go and rest,” murmured Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Thank you everyone for making the long trip. You will be escorted to your accommodations. We’ve arranged it the same as the previous year so that there will be no inconvenience,” said Amethyst. She looked at Roman and nodded.</p>
<p>On Roman’s instructions, the maids escorted the respective nobles to the buildings where they would reside for the duration of the annual festival.</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say that I would be sleeping in the same room as last year, Lady Skad?” asked Count Glacia.</p>
<p>Amethyst hesitated. “Yes. Count Glacia. It’s been arranged to be the same as last year. If it’s not to your liking we can….”</p>
<p>“No, not at all. All good for me,” said Count Glacia, smiling warmly. But Alexcent’s gaze flickered to Amethyst and she thought she saw a bit of disappointment in them. It had seemed everything had been going on well until now, but with that one look, she felt like she had made a big mistake. Count Glacia smiled, nodded and followed the maid to the main mansion to be shown her room.</p>
<p><em>Why is she going towards the main mansion? </em>Amethyst thought. The rest of the nobles were escorted to another building near the mansion where arrangements had been made but Count Glacia was the only guest who was heading towards the main mansion. Amethyst looked at Lunia, Gen and Pon who were standing near her. Gen looked at Pon uncertainly, Pon avoided his gaze and looked afar into the distance. Lunia seemed anxious and fidgety.</p>
<p>Alexcent turned and headed towards the main mansion. Amethyst watched Alexcent’s back and then followed him into the mansion as well.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“What in the ….! Call Pon immediately!” roared Amethyst.</p>
<p>Pon had expected it and arrived at Amethyst’ room after a short while. “Yes, Madam,” he said.</p>
<p>“Explain yourself Pon,” said Amethyst, “Why is Count Glacia in the room next to Alexcent?” She glared at him.</p>
<p>“You instructed it to be the way it is, Madam,” said Pon calmly.</p>
<p>“Me?” thundered Amethyst, “When?”</p>
<p>“You instructed me to prepare everything exactly the way it was the previous year,” said Pon, “So everything was done that way.”</p>
<p>“What?” said Amethyst, “So Count Glacia used the room next to Alec the previous year?”</p>
<p>Pon hesitated. “Yes,” he said.</p>
<p>“What?!” exclaimed Amethyst.</p>
<p>“My apologies, Madam,” said Pon, bowing.</p>
<p>“You should have at least informed me!” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Madam, did you perhaps read the document I had prepared for you containing the information about the guests?” asked Pon. He had passed her the document urging her to read it. She had meant to get around to reading it but had forgotten.</p>
<p><em>Even so, he could have just informed me, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>He must have known that it looked suspicious. </em>“Are you saying that it’s my fault because I forgot to read the document?” she said, “You must have obviously noticed that it would have been awkward to place Count Glacia’s room next to Alec.”</p>
<p>“Of course not, Madam,” said Pon, “But I assumed you had already read it and had no problem with the arrangement. I felt it too bold of me to ask you. I am just a butler serving the Lord and the Lady, it would not dare to ask about their personal affairs.”</p>
<p>Everything Pon said was right. He had urged her to read the information many times, but she had always out it away. <em>I should have questioned him when he looked uncomfortable after I instructed him to arrange everything same as the previous year. </em>She sighed. It wouldn’t do to blame everything on Pon. Partly, her complacency was to blame as well. Amethyst felt ashamed of herself for not taking this seriously.</p>
<p>“Even so, Pon,” said Amethyst, “You could have given me a hint, or a heads up. If there is anything of the sort in the future, please don’t hesitate to inform me. Honestly, it would make my life a whole lot easier. You would be helping me.” She clenched her fists. There was no point now when things had turned out like this.</p>
<p>The fact that Count Glacia had been using the room next to Alec before, disturbed her. Was she his mistress? His old lover? Was she still…? It won’t to do change her accommodation in such short notice. It would come off as rude. What could she possibly do? Amethyst grimaced.</p>
<p>“You may leave, Pon,” she said curtly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” she said. He bowed politely and left the room.</p>
