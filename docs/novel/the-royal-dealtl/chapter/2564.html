            <p><strong>Chapter 108 – Tea Party (1)</strong></p>
<p>The alcohol flowed down her throat and burned her almost empty stomach. She felt heat rise to her cheeks. “I like the fruity taste of it,” she declared.</p>
<p>Baron Piamon laughed. “Lady Skad seems to be quite good with her drinks.” He refilled her glass.</p>
<p>It was stronger than she expected but she took her time to enjoy the fruity aftertaste. It tasted somewhere between hard liquor and soju. Amethyst raised the glass to her lips again. Her vision started to blur. <em>Why can’t I see anything? </em>She thought. <em>Why do I feel so light—</em></p>
<p>The one quickest to catch Amethyst as she slid sideways from her chair was Alexcent. Her body burned and her breathing came very roughly. Her face was red. She laughed. <em>It burns…I can’t breathe…</em></p>
<p>“Goddamn it,” cursed Alexcent as he lifted her up in her arms and walked out of the banquet hall. He couldn’t care less about the rest of the guests at that moment.</p>
<p>“Pon,” he barked at his butler.</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lord.” Pon appeared before him, looking with concern at Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Call the doctor, hurry,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Right away, My Lord,” said Pon and hurried away.</p>
<p>Alexcent reached Amethyst’ bedroom and laid her on the bed. He loosened her dress and corset. He wiped away her sweat. His hands gentle on her forehead. “I told you,” he said impatiently. But even as his tone was irritated, his hands were still gentle. Her eyes were red, and her head throbbed. Her lipstick was smeared on her lower lip. He wiped it away with his thumb. “I told you not to drink it,” he said.</p>
<p>As tender as his hands seemed on her forehead, Amethyst’ anger flared. She was annoyed of so many restrictions placed on her. I told you not to smile too much. I told you not to talk so much…</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“I guess the rumors were true,” said Countess Onslow, as she watched Alexcent rush out of the hall with Amethyst in his arms.</p>
<p>“I understand why the capital was in uproar.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear about how he made fireworks with his magic solely for her? I never expected him to be a romantic.”</p>
<p>“Precisely, this is the first time I have seen the Duke display any emotion at all.”</p>
<p>“Did you see how he was taking care of her meal as well? And gazing at her so lovingly?”</p>
<p>“Yes! I saw it too. The two of them are so sweet together.”</p>
<p>The hall was filled with nobles conversing and being surprised about the Duke being capable of romace at all.</p>
<p>“Do you think Lady Skad will be alright?” asked Baron Piamon anxiously. His worry was understandable, after all it was the drink he had offered, and Amethyst was the Duke’s wife!</p>
<p>“I am sure she will be alright,” said Count Glacia calmly, “except maybe a bad hangover.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s a relief,” said Baron Piamon. He kept staring at the door through which Alexcent had left with Amethyst. Count Renove noticed his discomfort and tried to lighten the mood.</p>
<p>“Well, come now,” said Count Renove, “Can we enjoy a glass each? Since the Duke is gone, we can loosen up a bit and drink to our fill.”</p>
<p>“Hey,” said Count Onslow, “That’s not a bad idea.”</p>
<p>“Really,” said Countess Onslow, rolling her eyes, “My husband just can’t say to alcohol.”</p>
<p>“Ha ha ha, my dearest,” said Count Onslow, “I am just trying to make sure Baron Piamon’s gift doesn’t go to waste. Besides, he could do with a review on his new product, eh?”</p>
<p>Baron Piamon laughed. “Yes, of course.” He then proceeded to pour a drink for everyone present.</p>
<p>Countess Onslow smiled as she accepted a glass herself. The feast continued and the nobles drank their fill.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Groan.</p>
<p>Amethyst felt as though her head was splitting. She sat up in bed and the light seemed too bright, everything too bright except Lunia’s voice, which sounded stern.</p>
<p>“How is your hangover?” asked Lunia, sternly.</p>
<p>“Ugh,” managed Amethyst. “How did I get here?”</p>
<p>“Do you not remember anything?” asked Lunia. She sighed. “Who else would take care of you? The Duke himself, of course.”</p>
<p><em>Alec….</em> The space beside her was cold, Alexcent hadn’t stayed the night today as well. Amethyst sighed.</p>
<p>“Drink this,” said Lunia, as she handed her a bowl with a foul-smelling liquid. “Doctor’s prescription. It will clear your mind.”</p>
<p>“The doctor was here?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Lunia, “The Duke called him.”</p>
<p>“That’s so overboard. It was just a drink!” She raised the bowl to her lips and sipped. The foul-smelling thing was so bitter. She closed her mind and drank it down in one go. The bitterness remained on her tongue.</p>
<p>“Blech! Tastes horrible,” said Amethyst, “What happened at the feast after?”</p>
<p>“Well, after Duke and you left the hall, the nobles went all out and drank late into the night,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded handing the empty bowl back to her. “Great! I thought I had ruined it,” she said, “And Lunia, I am so sorry. I must have worried you.”</p>
<p>“Do you really mean that?” asked Lunia, “I was worried out of my mind.”</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded guiltily. “Of course, I mean it.”</p>
<p>“Good,” said Lunia, “No more alcohol from now on, then.”</p>
<p>“I don’t plan on drinking for some time after this,” she said, “Where is Alec?”</p>
<p>“The Duke is in the conference room,” said Lunia, “With the other nobles. The meeting has begun.”</p>
<p>“What? Already?” asked Amethyst, “What about the wives? Shouldn’t we be getting ready to invite them to the tea party?”</p>
<p>“So good of you to notice,” said Lunia, glaring at her.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” said Amethyst sheepishly.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, the other ladies must have drank a fair bit themselves. They must still be resting. It seems like the tea party will be too much today,” said Lunia, “so I think we should decide on the tea party after assessing their condition.”</p>
<p>“I’m relieved that I’m not the only one in this state,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Madam, you should rest a while more. I will come back in the afternoon to discuss the details about the tea party,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Amethyst, “Thank you so much Lunia.”</p>
<p>Lunia took her leave and Amethyst lay back on the bed. The medicine was foul, but it was making her feel a bit better. But she felt upset. <em>I guess Alec left immediately after he dropped me here. </em>She scowled. <em>He must be furious… No, he must be busy with the meeting. </em>Slowly, her eyes drooped, and she felt asleep unaware of the fuss Alexcent had made in the night and pestered the doctor and Lunia regarding her health.</p>
