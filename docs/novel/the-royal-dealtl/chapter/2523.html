            <p><strong>Chapter 145</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst cried in the carriage as it headed back to the mansion. Gen, who was seated opposite her, offered her his handkerchief. “Please,” he said politely as she tried to decline.</p>
<p>“Th… thank you,” sobbed Amethyst.</p>
<p>At his kindness, she burst into tears anew. She cried for a long time at the disastrous day. She cried for Lunia too, <em>how could he do that? He humiliated me in front of everyone. What did I even do that was so wrong? Poor Lunia! </em>She wiped at her tears. <em>I hate him! I will never forgive him. Never!</em></p>
<p>Finally, her tears subsided, and she thought about it. <em>He told me not to come. Maybe I should have listened. I wish that bastard could be a little more honest and explain things to me, so I understand why. Because of me, Lunia is gone.</em> <em>He never called me Amethyst before. He must really have been furious. Everything is ruined! The festival!</em></p>
<p>Amethyst, forgetting that Gen was in the carriage, let out a scream of regret. Gen heaved a weary sigh. “It seems this time, you really crossed the line,” said Gen.</p>
<p>“Even you think that?” asked Amethyst, sadly. “Did I really do something wrong?’</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand what was so wrong about it,” she said, “Why was he so furious? I didn’t know he was that obsessed with a stupid hunting match.”</p>
<p><em>That’s because he doesn’t his monster-like self to be seen by you, </em>thought Gen. But he couldn’t say that aloud.</p>
<p>“It is not only because of the hunting match,” said Gen, calmly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” asked Amethyst, “Everything that happened has to do with that stupid match.”</p>
<p>“The hunting match is just a competition on the surface,” explained Gen, “It is like putting on a show. It is a, in essence, a cruel eradication of beasts.”</p>
<p>“A show?” said Amethyst with a snort, “Obviously. Men love showing off their power by killing innocent animals. I am not surprised.”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand,” said Gen, “It is a form of warning to the other heads of the households. If they were ever to go against him or the empress and commit treason, they know what’s waiting for them. It serves as a warning and a reminder to never cross that line. They see him in action in the hunting match.” Gen looked at her. “Why do you think the duke puts up with the other heads of the households when he doesn’t really need them?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Amethyst, “For business. They have their estate, and their trade. It helps the kingdom, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they do,” said Gen, “But the duke doesn’t really need them for that. He can achieve all that alone. They are more of a nuisance to him, to be honest. They only create and whine about useless problems. Even so, the reason he holds the annual festival to keep them entertained is only because they are the pro-empress faction.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was listening to him quietly now. “They just act as a shield against the anti-empress factions. There are very few nobles in the pro-empress factions, so he withstands their petty complaints and desires in the annual conference. He suppresses his rage against these petty things and takes it all out during the hunting match. It always serves as a reminder that keeps the other heads of the households in their line. They see not a human but a formidable monster during these times.”</p>
<p>“A monster? In what way?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“The exact meaning of the word but in the form of a metaphor,” said Gen, “It is not an ordinary hunting match. The beasts are killed in the most cruel and violent way. And none are as cruel and terrifying as the duke. I am sure he wouldn’t have wanted you, most of all, to see him like that. It’s not a very nice sight. I try not to barf when I have to see it. Same goes for the others. Everyone is always terrified when they see the gruesome sight.”</p>
<p>“And how am I supposed to know this without anybody ever telling me the truth?” said Amethyst, “I only thought the hunting match was a friendly match between the heads of the households. It is not my fault that I knew nothing of it.”</p>
<p>Gen nodded. “Not one member of the staff is aware of this. Nobody, who hasn’t been on the hunting match themselves, knows what the hunting match truly entails. Except for me.”</p>
<p>“What about Lunia?” asked Amethyst, thinking of her sadly, “She was his personal maid, was she not?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think she knew,” said Gen, “Even Sir Hill, who is the leader of the knights, doesn’t know about it.”</p>
<p>That sent another pang of guilt and sadness through Amethyst’s heart. <em>If Lunia had known this fact, she would have stopped me from planning the trip at all costs. And now, she lost her job, and it is all my fault.</em></p>
