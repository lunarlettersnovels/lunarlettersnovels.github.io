            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 61</strong></p>
<p>“Bring this to the butler and get his signature.” Dajal ordered dismissively.</p>
<p>“May I know what I need his signature for?” Amethyst asked upon receiving Dajal’s ledgers.</p>
<p>“It’s this month’s ledger.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>
<p><em>Ah, I hoped it would be something I can use as evidence, but it’s only the ledger.</em> <em>Since it needs to be approved by Pon I’m sure it’s a fake ledger.</em></p>
<p><em>But if I run into Pon in this state then my secret undercover will be blown away.</em></p>
<p>“May I ask why we need to show this to the butler? Shouldn’t this be shown to the lady of the house…”</p>
<p>“Ha, you sure have a lot of questions.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry. It’s just my first time working in such a big mansion so I’m not familiar with things…”</p>
<p>“What would a daughter of a well-known noble know about running a mansion? I’m sure all she knows is to sip tea all day or play dress up.”</p>
<p>“Is… that so.”</p>
<p>“That’s right! This must be why she left even the running of the main estate to the butler in charge and spends her time shopping. Well, that makes things easier for me.”</p>
<p>At Dajal’s words, Amethyst clenched her fist. If she hadn’t tasked Pon to run everything then things might have been different. It felt like all of this was her fault.</p>
<p>Just as her mind came to such a thought, Dajal shouted.</p>
<p>“What are you standing there for, go!”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Once Amethyst reached the main estate, she looked for Lunia instead of Pon.</p>
<p>“Madam?”</p>
<p>“Lunia, I need your help!”</p>
<p>“What… I was wondering where you were these days. Was this what you were up to?”</p>
<p>“It’s a long story. So please pretend you don’t know anything.”</p>
<p>“It’s not something that can be overlooked as long as I pretend not to know! The moment His Highness finds out, my head will no longer be attached to my neck!” Lunia said in fluster.</p>
<p>“I will make sure no harm goes your way.”</p>
<p>“You are already causing me plenty.”</p>
<p>“Lunia…” Lunia took a step back as Amethyst looked at her with puppy dog eyes.</p>
<p>“Fine. How can I help you?”</p>
<p>“I’m here on an errand. This is the ledger from Dajal that needs to be approved by Pon. It needs his signature but as you can see I am in no position to get it myself.”</p>
<p>“That is true… Since Sir Pon has an eye for detail you just need me to get it signed on your behalf?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I will be grateful if you will.”</p>
<p>Lunia accepted the ledger and flipped through. “Did you investigate it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But I’ve not made much progress. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Well… there’s nothing special on the ledger. Nothing seems illegitimate.”</p>
<p>“Precisely. Everything is too perfect.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I also think the real ledger must be elsewhere… which is what I need to find.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you are going around in a maid’s uniform?”</p>
<p>Amethyst shrugged in reply.</p>
<p>“I will investigate on my own as well.” Lunia offered.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“And also… Madam, since you asked me to pretend not to know, should you ever encounter a dangerous situation, just shout and ask someone to save you as loudly as you can. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Shout?” Amethyst quirked an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Yes, shout asking for someone to save you.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I understand.”</p>
<p>Actually, Amethyst didn’t quite understand what Lunia meant but promised that she would nonetheless.</p>
<p>“You should rest for the day,” Lunia said.</p>
<p>“But I need to bring the ledger back to Dajal. If I don’t he will get suspicious….”</p>
<p>“Leave that to me. I will tell Sir Pon that I received it from a maid from the side estate, and that I asked that maid to run my errand so have another maid pass it back to Dajal.”</p>
<p>“Carol.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?” Lunia was taken aback.</p>
<p>“My name. It’s Carol. That is… among the employees I told them to call me Carol.”</p>
<p>“Ha…!”</p>
<p>Lunia placed her hand on her forehead and let out a loud sigh.</p>
<p>“Just… how long have you been going around like that?”</p>
<p>“For some time.”</p>
<p>“Really… I’m more surprised that no one found out.”</p>
<p>Amethyst let out a forced laugh, and just as Lunia advised retired to her bedroom. She quickly changed into a dress before the maids could see and sat down on the sofa.</p>
<p><em>Phew!</em> … For some reason, she couldn’t help but let out a loud sigh.</p>
<p>From the window she heard the sound of horse hooves and a carriage, so she leaned against the window and looked down.</p>
<p><em>Alec?</em></p>
<p><em>He’s back earlier than I thought!</em></p>
<p><em>I’m glad I followed Lunia’s advice and returned earlier. If not there might have been a big ruckus saying the prince’s wife is missing. Or I would have been caught in my maid uniform.</em></p>
<p>If her undercover mission was busted before she could find the evidence, then the already suspicious and extremely careful Dajal would raise up his barriers.</p>
<p>She saw the figure that normally returned after dusk descend the carriage. Amethyst left her bedroom and made her way towards the entrance.</p>
