            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 81</strong></p>
<p>“Do you have a particular design you prefer?” asked Jerome.</p>
<p>“Anything will do,” said Amethyst, waving her hand. “I just want something simple but effective to fulfil its function.”</p>
<p>“How about your family crest, ma’am?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No,” said Amethyst, “I don’t want it to be showy and extravagant than necessary.”</p>
<p>“As you wish,” said Jerome, reluctantly.</p>
<p>Amethyst knew that usually the sword held the family crest on the steel or the pommel but she also knew that she wouldn’t be a member of the Skad family for long. It was no use having the Skad crest on her sword.</p>
<p>Jerome showed her some of the guns that he kept in boxes. Every single one was elaborately carved and looked very pompous. She found one which was smaller than the others and looked old. She picked it up, prepared her stance, closed an eye and tried to aim.</p>
<p>“I will take this one,” she said, “It looks like it would be easier to carry.”</p>
<p>“Do you know how to use it?” asked Jerome.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” she said, “But I will learn.”</p>
<p>Emeis’ shopping ended with Jerome’s departure. She found the boxes of jewels that Dunph had mentioned when she returned to her room. She sighed. She opened them one by one to see exorbitant accessories in all designs, ranging from hairpins, to bracelets to glittering earrings.</p>
<p>“Do you not like them?” asked Lunia hesitantly.</p>
<p>“It’s not that,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Then why do you look so down, ma’am?”</p>
<p>“It’s too much,” said Amethyst, “It’s overwhelming.”</p>
<p>“It’s only natural that he would want to shower you with gifts,” said Lunia, trying to make her feel better. Amethyst forced herself to smile.</p>
<p>“Did you enjoy shopping?” came a man’s voice from the door. He was here.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amethyst, turning around.</p>
<p>Alexcent walked towards her. “They why do you look so downcast?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing like that,” she said, smiling, “Thank you for the gifts.”</p>
<p>“Do you like them?” he asked, looking at her.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, “But…”</p>
<p>“But?” asked Alexcent, eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>“It’s too much,” she said.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to feel that way,” he said softly.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said, and forced a smile. It didn’t matter, he wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Amethyst felt bitter about it. She felt a burden in her heart. She wondered if all these expensive gifts, that she didn’t ask for, made her uncomfortable or was it because of Aran Bank? While Alexcent owned Aran Bank which dealt with black money, she was here lavishing on the jewels it bought her. It left a bitter taste in her mouth.</p>
<p>“These gifts cost money,” she said, “And Aran Bank—”</p>
<p>“I know Aran Bank is shady, but I don’t own all of it,” said Alexcent cutting her off, “I am only the manager, so to speak. I do not make much profit from it.”</p>
<p>It would make her feel lighter if only that were true, but she knew better. It still made her feel uncomfortable and unconvinced. Nothing good could come out of black money, only danger.</p>
<p>“Do you want the bank gone?” he asked, looking at her forlorn expression.</p>
<p>“You can do that?” she asked, stunned.</p>
<p>“If you want,” he said.</p>
<p>Amethyst felt a little relieved at his words, realizing that he had no love for black money. But it also made her feel a little guilty that he would go to such extent to please her. She knew she could not ask him to do that.</p>
<p>“No, it’s alright,” she said, tiredly, “I just wish you weren’t involved in these shady dealings. I don’t want you to be in danger.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be in any danger,” he said, gently, “But if it is bothering you so much, I can turn Aran Bank into a normal bank, without any ‘shady dealings’.” Amethyst felt her heart flutter. She didn’t know if she could ask him to do that. And if she did, what would it entail? She just looked at him fondly.</p>
<p>“Come here,” he said, taking her hand and pulling her over to stand in front of the mirror, “You haven’t worn the necklace I bought you.”</p>
<p>Alexcent picked the necklace from the box and stood behind her. He swept her hair to the front to expose her neckline. There was still a faint bruise that hadn’t completely healed and he furrowed his brows at the sight. He lowered the necklace on her neck and closed the clasp. She felt the cold weight of the metal on her collarbone. He placed his hand on her shoulders.</p>
<p>“It suits you,” he whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she said, “The jewel reminds me of your eyes.” She turned away from the mirror towards him. His red eyes gazed so tenderly down at her that color filled her world and made her heart flutter. Alexcent lowered his head and kissed her on the neck. His lips were hot, as though branding her neck with his mark.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Alexcent was in a meeting with his subordinates discussing on next year’s budget when Pon came rushing into the room.</p>
<p>“Master,” he said, hurriedly, “You have to come with me to the training field now!”</p>
<p>“Pon, you can see that I am having a meeting,” said Alexcent sternly.</p>
<p>“It’s Madam…,” said Pon, breathless from running.</p>
<p>Alexcent’s eyes flashed at his words. He stood up. “Let’s end the meeting here for today,” he said.</p>
<p>He rushed out with Pon to the training field. When they reached, they saw knights facing Amethyst.</p>
