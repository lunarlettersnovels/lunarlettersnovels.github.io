            <p><strong>Chapter 296</strong></p>
<p>“Alec, promise me. Please.”</p>
<p>“I promise.”</p>
<p>He looked adorable as he scowled. He didn’t like it and yet he respected her wish. This man was like a beast but could be so understanding towards her. Alexcent couldn’t look away from her lips. He leaned down and kissed her.</p>
<p>His tongue explored her mouth and made her whimper. His huge hands were already at her chest, fondling her. “Hmm,” she moaned in pleasure.</p>
<p>His excitement seemed to reach its peak as he heard her moan. Something hard poked near Amethyst’s butt. She pulled away and looked at him. She didn’t understand how his body reacted so quickly.</p>
<p>He lifted her up and placed her on his desk. He kissed her fiercely while his hand fumbled with her dress. One of his hands pulled her close while the other lifted up the hem of her dress and puller her underwear down. Her legs were open wide.</p>
<p>He lowered his head to intimate parts and kissed her there. “Ahhhhh,” she gasped.</p>
<p>His tongue explored her insides. He sucked and licked right where she was very sensitive. The desk was wet with his saliva and her body fluid. Amethyst grabbed the edge of the desk as her pleasure mounted.</p>
<p>“Alec!” she called. He obliged.</p>
<p>He pulled down his pants and thrust inside her. As he increased his movement, Amethyst could no longer hold the edge of her desk. Instead, she wrapped her arms around his head and hugged it o her chest.</p>
<p>The office had turned into a bedroom, and the desk was the hardest bed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“My Lord, I finished prepping. The moment you give the order, it will be done.”</p>
<p>Alexcent tapped on the desk while listening to Gen’s report.</p>
<p><em>“So, leave him alone, alright?”</em></p>
<p>If it wasn’t for that promise, he would have killed him in very painful way. <em>Maybe I can inflict a pain worse than death on him. She had said, “leave him alone.” She probably meant not to kill him. I am not breaking my promise if I let him live then…</em></p>
<p>“Gen.”</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lord.”</p>
<p>“That bastard, make it so that he’ll never set his foot in the Empire again.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?! Why?” Gen was surprised. Alexcent’s wish for killing that man had abated a little.</p>
<p>“Make it so that he’ll be in fear of being chased his entire life. Until the moment of his death.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I will contact Fidorun Bank and Alst Merchant right away.”</p>
<p>“Good.” Alexcent nodded.</p>
<p>Gen was scared of the way he smiled. Of course, he wouldn’t let that man go so easily. He had been surprised for nothing.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Count Zaizen went bankrupt due to an immense amount of debt. He had no way to pay it all off so he ran away. Other lenders refused to lend him any money. He didn’t have a place to stay within the whole Empire.</p>
<p>As for Amethyst, she assumed Count Zaizen’s was off the hook and didn’t care about it anymore. However, when she ran into Gen one morning, she realized that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>Gen looked very tired. “Gen,” she called.</p>
<p>“Ah. Yes, My Lady.” He bowed but he almost stumbled to the floor.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” she asked with concern.</p>
<p>“Ah… pardon? Yes. Yes! I am fine, of course.”</p>
<p>“You don’t look fine.”</p>
<p>“It’s… I am just tired. I haven’t been sleeping well for a few days, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“You are working too much, Gen. You will drop dead at this point.”</p>
<p>“The truth is His Excellency….”</p>
<p>“Yeah? What about Alec?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I’ll be off….”</p>
<p>“What? Gen! Alright. Don’t overwork.”</p>
<p>He had wanted to say something but she didn’t want to press him and make him stressed when he looked so tired.</p>
<p>Gen changed his mind midway and walked back to Amethyst. “My Lady…”</p>
<p>“Yes?’</p>
<p>“I need your help.”</p>
<p>“Of course! Anything!”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Could you write a love letter to His Excellency?”</p>
<p>“Uh… what?”</p>
<p>Gen took her hand in his and begged. “Please. I beg you. Please write him a love letter. You will be saving my life.”</p>
<p>“Why a love letter all of a sudden?” she asked in confusion.</p>
<p>“Just… please do it. It doesn’t even have to be as many as the ones you wrote to Count Zaizen…”</p>
<p>“What?! Love letter to Count Zaizen?”</p>
<p>“The letter you wrote before your marriage. His Excellency saw it and he’s taking out on everyone. Everyone is about to drop dead from stress.”</p>
<p><em>How does Alec know about the letter? Zaizen had said it was stolen…. Oh god! Alec stole it!</em></p>
<p>Amethyst closed her eyes and sighed in frustration. “Gen, I didn’t write that letter.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes! I never wrote a love letter to anyone!”</p>
<p>“Well… it doesn’t matter. Please… please write a love letter to him. It will save many people from his wrath. Please.”</p>
<p>Amethyst took a deep breath. “Alright. How many were there? One?”</p>
<p>“No way. Five in total.”</p>
<p><em>Oh god! Amethyst of the past must really have been a writer. Five?!</em> <em>Why did she have to write so many?</em></p>
<p>“Thank you, thank you. You are my savior.”</p>
<p>“This is the second time you are doing this. You said the same thing last time.”</p>
<p>“Really? Well, it’s true! Please excuse me now. His Excellency will be even more angry if I am late.”</p>
<p>Gen kept calling her a savior so she won’t be able to refuse his requests. Amethyst sighed.</p>
<p>“Good luck with work, Gen. You certainly are working hard!”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your acknowledgement, My Lady.” He walked away.</p>
<p>Amethyst shook her head in resignation. <em>What am I ever going to do with this man…?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst now faced a difficult task ahead. <em>How do you even start a love letter? </em>She wondered. <em>I never even dated long enough to learn it! What should I do? </em>She felt overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Amethyst chewed on her fingernails. Gen kept rushing her. In the end, she decided to do it in the classic way. She picked up a flower when she went on a walk. She flattened it in between a book so it could dry.</p>
<p>She pasted the flower on the front of the envelope so it wouldn’t break. Instead of fancy language, she chose sincerity. She ended the letter with:</p>
<p>[Love you always.</p>
<p>Forever yours,<br>
Amethyst]</p>
