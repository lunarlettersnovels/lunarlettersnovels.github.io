            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 92 – A Rare Weapon</strong></p>
<p><em>Well, what can I do? They have already seen us. And technically, it is not their fault, not mine either. It’s Alec’s fault, wooing me every chance he gets! </em>Amethyst thought.</p>
<p>“It is not proper to peek,” she said to them, “But it’s alright if you didn’t mean it deliberately.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your understanding, Madam,” said Leyrian, “Ever so grateful!”</p>
<p>“Do you really feel grateful?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Of course, Madam,” said Buer.</p>
<p>“Then as a token of your gratitude,” said Amethyst, “Teach me how to use the sword.”</p>
<p>“What?!” exclaimed Leyrian, “But that’s—”</p>
<p>“Fine then,” interrupted Amethyst, “I will just tell Alec about you two sneaking about and watching us practice in the morning.”</p>
<p>“No, please!” said Buer, positively horrified.</p>
<p>Leyrian seemed very displeased and trapped. If Alexcent found out about his knights peeking at the Duchess and himself ‘practicing’ their swords in the morning, the Duke will surely have their heads for it.</p>
<p>“I will teach you the basic posture and position,” obliged Leyrian, reluctantly.</p>
<p>“Thank you!” said Amethyst and lifted her sword.</p>
<p>Buer gasped. “Isn’t that the Duke’s sword?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Well, yes,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“How were you able to get that precious thing?” asked Buer aghast.</p>
<p>“Precious?” asked Amethyst confused. Alexcent had given it to her saying it was ‘just a sword’.</p>
<p>“Yes!” said Buer, “There is only one sword like that in the entire world, and at the moment it is in your hands. It is very rare, this sword.”</p>
<p>“Only one?” asked Amethyst, surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Buer, “Forgive me, Madam. But can I hold it for a second?”</p>
<p>Amethyst placed the sword in his outstretched hand. He lifted it and swung it once. “Do you see the dark red jewel here?” he asked, indicating the jewel on the pommel, as he handed the sword back to her, reverently. “The jewel was supposedly held by the goddess herself when she descended to the earth. It is called the soulstone.”</p>
<p>“The soulstone?” she asked.</p>
<p>Buer nodded. “Yes,” he continued, “It had great mana, incomparable to anything in the world. The sword is just like any other sword. But the gem gives it its power. It is almost a living being.”</p>
<p>“That’s why Alec…,” she trailed off.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” said Buer, “Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“Alec murmured something to it, and it became very light for me to lift and swing with it,” she said recalling the incident.</p>
<p>“That’s only the surface of what the sword can do,” Buer explained, “But the Duke had never allowed near the sword, much less touch it.” He looked at Amethyst.</p>
<p>“He let me borrow it until mine arrives,” she said. <em>Alec had so nonchalantly given it to me, </em>Amethyst thought, <em>what’s he playing at, giving something as powerful and rare to me like a toy he couldn’t care less about?</em></p>
<p>“I see,” said Buer, “Well the Duke is very skilled. He can wield any sword powerfully, whether magical or ordinary.”</p>
<p>“Is he that good as swords?” she asked.</p>
<p>“He is extraordinary,” Buer said, excitedly, “You should see him in a battle. He gauges the opponent’s weakness at a glance. None can stand against him. The knights adore him.”</p>
<p>“Buer!” thundered Leyrian startling both Buer and Amethyst. “Madam, please don’t take his words to heart, Buer only means respect.”</p>
<p>Amethyst found Leyrian’s outburst strange. Of course, Buer meant respect. He was practically drooling at the sword and Alexcent’s fighting abilities. What else would it mean? <em>Anyway, I will return Alec’s sword once mine arrives, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>I can’t possibly take this precious and rare thing.</em></p>
<p>Leyrian walked to her and began instructing her on the posture and holding the sword and swinging it in a way that it could do most damage.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Mr. Pon,” Gen called, as he saw him walking through the hallway, “I was just coming to visit you.”</p>
<p>“Me?” asked Pon.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Gen, “This is the document for extra budget for the upcoming festival. Can you kindly pass it to the Duchess, please?”</p>
<p>“To the Duchess?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, “It’s her responsibility to greet the guests at the annual festival, she will need the extra budget to prepare for things.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” said Pon, but didn’t take the document. He looked reluctant. He thought that if the Duchess put off her work, and it was a big festival, it would fall on him. Which would be too much work in addition to the work he was bogged down with.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” asked Gen, “I remember you saying that she was very good at handling budgets. Is there a problem?” Gen had heard Pon commending the Duchess on her skills on handling the account book and cutting down on unnecessary expenses. She had hoped that she could slip this work to the Duchess so that she could get on with her other works. In the past, she had handled everything. But now, since the Duchess’ position was no longer empty and she had been hearing of her capabilities, Gen thought it would be apt to let the Duchess handle the budget for the festival.</p>
<p>“None at all,” stammered Pon, “I will pass it on.” He took the document from Gen who then bid him goodbye and walked to his office. Pon made his way to Amethyst.</p>
