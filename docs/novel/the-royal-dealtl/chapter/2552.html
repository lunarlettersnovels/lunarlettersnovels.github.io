            <p><strong>Chapter 116 – To Protect Belice (2)</strong></p>
<p>Despite being a commoner, she had risen to the title of a countess. She was formidable and never shy about her ambitions. She had spoken to him at one of the annual festivals in the past.</p>
<p>“I would like to report my husband,” she had said, approaching Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Report?” he had asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she had declared with confidence.</p>
<p>“What do you want to report him for?” Alexcent had asked.</p>
<p>“Treason. He is planning an uprising,” she had said.</p>
<p>Alexcent was momentarily stunned. Count Glacia was very meticulous. He never let anyone get even a whiff of his plans. “How do you know this?” he had asked.</p>
<p>“Because he habitually talks about how he would be the next prince when he is drunk.”</p>
<p>“That is just drunk gibberish. Do you have any evidence?”</p>
<p>“No, My Lord.”</p>
<p>“How daring,” Alexcent had said, “You report your husband without any evidence. Aren’t you scared of the consequences?” Alexcent had decided to humor her before he let it go.</p>
<p>“You have always considered him a pain.”</p>
<p>“Why would you say that?”</p>
<p>“The way you treat him with hostility.”</p>
<p>Alexcent had thought her very keen and observant. “That’s all?”</p>
<p>“You can use me to kill him,” she had said, “I can deal with the rumors and you will have your hands clean.”</p>
<p>“You will bear the rumors?” Alexcent had asked, surprised. “Even though it means living the rest of your life with people pointing fingers at you wherever you go?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Alexcent hesitated. It would immensely be easy, but everybody wanted something in return. He needed to know what it was that Arwin wanted. “What’s in it for you?” he asked, “Let’s do away with the ‘I want nothing in return’ bullshit to save time.”</p>
<p>“I want the title of the count, with the responsibilities.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Since there aren’t any heirs, I am sure it won’t be difficult to grant me the title.”</p>
<p>“That won’t be an issue,” said Alexcent, “But why?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it is necessary for me to explain myself and my past to form a bond with you,” said Arwin, “You get what you want and I get what I want. It’s a fair deal.”</p>
<p>Alexcent had laughed then. She, who Alexcent had approved, had been a witness to Count Glacia’s demise due to a heart attack at the appropriate time. The post-mortem was handled swiftly with Alexcent’s help. Arwin was quick and sharp and never let herself caught off guard. She never crossed her lines. She knew her limits. Everything had played out as they had planned. She was, in many ways, similar to him.</p>
<p>“Did Lady Skad like it?” asked Gen, interrupting Alexcent’s deep thoughts.</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Alexcent, “I am not too sure about that.”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Gen. “What happened? Did she not like it? It was so difficult to get them. All the baby’s breath was sold out.”</p>
<p>Gen only received lukewarm response from Alexcent, seeing him deep in thought. Alexcent then smirked suddenly.</p>
<p>“Why are you smiling like that?” asked Gen, “You look downright creepy when you do that.”</p>
<p>Alexcent paid him no attention. He was thinking about Amethyst. The way she was so defensive in the glass house. <em>What should I even do with you? Even though it was an obvious trick, to see you so angry. You look so adorable like that. Maybe I am twisted after all.</em></p>
<p>Alexcent tapped his fingers on the desk. It had been all fun and games but now he suddenly felt anxious. Today was the fifth night that he hadn’t gone to see her. He had expected her to come looking for him. He felt disappointed.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It was more than five nights that Amethyst had had to sleep alone in her room. Amethyst woke up this morning too, to find the space next to her empty. She woke up early today. She had never woken up this early before.</p>
<p>The baby’s breath sat by the window. There was a bird right outside chirping. The day looked foggy. The grim day reflected her mood. She tried to cheer herself. The tea party had been a success! Even so, Amethyst felt down today.</p>
<p>She tried to blink the sleep out of her eyes. She had no time to be melancholic. <em>We are all going to Newhenfield to shop, </em>she recalled. She tried to make herself get out of her bed. Her eyes were threatening to close again.</p>
<p>She changed into something simple and comfortable. She picked the sword that was wrapped in a flimsy paper up and examined it. It had been delivered under her name. It was finally here! It looked simple without unnecessary designs. She liked it immediately. She liked how casual it looked despite being a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>As she walked out of her bedroom, she heard footsteps approaching on the hallway outside. It was Alexcent and Count Glacia. The two seemed very weary and were walking towards her. It was too late to pretend she hadn’t seen them and go back to her room. <em>Why in hell do I have to put up with them this early?</em></p>
<p>“Alec,” she greeted, “Count Glacia. Seems like the meeting just ended.” She tried to initiate the conversation since there was no way she could avoid them now.</p>
