            <p><strong>Chapter 158</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent stared at Gen. “Why do you think that?”</p>
<p>“When Count Glacia bid her farewell hoping to meet next year again,” said Gen, “Her complexion turned pale.”</p>
<p>“Really?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Gen, “Maybe that’s why she thinks she needs to go back…”</p>
<p><em>Now when I think about it, she didn’t look too well after that, </em>thought Alexcent. <em>She doesn’t smile much either.</em></p>
<p>Alexcent’s fury disappeared and he visible relaxed. “How do I extend the contract?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I think you probably have to talk about it with her,” said Gen, “You didn’t really draw up a formal contract.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Alexcent, brightening, “We didn’t really have a formal contract. It was just verbal. Then what if I nullify the agreement?”</p>
<p>“Well, that would be a little problematic,” said Gen, “You both didn’t write and sign a contract in the formal manner, but a verbal contract is still a contract.”</p>
<p>“Then look into it,” said Alexcent, “Figure out a way by which we can nullify the entire contract, verbal or otherwise.”</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lord,” said Gen.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ever since the event of last night when Amethyst ran out in her sleep, she was being coddled and cared for more than necessary. Even before everything, the care that they showed her had always been excessive but now…</p>
<p>“Madam, please watch out. You might trip and fall!”</p>
<p><em>Excuse me, I’m not learning to take my first steps.</em></p>
<p>“Madam, you might cut your hand! Let me do that for you”</p>
<p><em>Seriously? You want to flip the pages of my book?</em></p>
<p>Everyone seemed to be getting overly protective of her these days. They treated her like a fragile glass doll. Amethyst sighed. Wherever she went, maids were hovering around her making it impossible to spend her time in peace by herself.</p>
<p><em>At this rate, it is better to have Roman and Lunia by my side all the time like in the annual festival!</em></p>
<p>In the end, she dismissed the endless maid hovering around her and decided to keep Roman and Lunia by her side just so she could breathe a little.</p>
<p>“Madam, what’s concerning you?” asked Roman one day when Amethyst sighed sadly.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Amethyst, “I just feel suffocated because everyone hovers around me treating me like I am going to break down any time.”</p>
<p>“Everyone is just worried,” said Roman, “And I think that is the way they show their loyalty to you, I think. I am sure it will subside after a few days.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said Amethyst, “And I am grateful for it but… they fret so much at anything I do. I can’t even do anything anymore without someone stopping me.”</p>
<p>“Shall we go for a walk, if you want?” asked Roman.</p>
<p>“Even that!” said Amethyst, “If I take three steps out of my room, Pon will appear out of nowhere and stop me.”</p>
<p>Roman chuckled. “That’s true.”</p>
<p>Just then Lunia entered the room with an armful of things. “Madam! Look at all these things,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“What is all this?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“I looked into it,” said Lunia, “Apparently drawing is good for soothing your nerves.”</p>
<p>“Lunia, are you treating me like a patient too?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“No!” said Lunia, “But since you can’t go for a walk, I thought you would be bored in your room.”</p>
<p>Lunia lay the canvas on the table and placed a brush, a pencil, and a palette beside it. “Why don’t you give it a try?” she said, “You must be bored and it seems like a good idea. It might be fun!”</p>
<p>“Shall I?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes!” said Lunia, “You might turn out to be an artistic genius. You never know.”</p>
<p>“Hm,” said Amethyst, “But it’s boring if I do it alone. Then let’s do it together!”</p>
<p>“Us too?” asked Roman.</p>
<p>“Yes!” said Amethyst, “Like Lunia said, you might have a talent that you didn’t know about.”</p>
<p>Lunia seemed hesitant at first but soon both agreed. Roman squeezed a bit of pain on the palette while Amethyst picked up the pencil to sketch something.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Alexcent returned to his room late at night after preparing for the Royal Hunt and the new Congress. He found some pictures hung on the walls of the corridor that led to his room. “What is this?” he asked.</p>
<p>“These days, Madam has taken to painting,” informed Pon.</p>
<p>“Really?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Pon, “Apparently painting and drawing are good for the nerves. She enjoys it very much.”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Alexcent, “So Ash drew every one of these?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Pon.</p>
<p>Alexcent smiled. “She never has a dull moment in her life, does she?” he said, fondly, “She always does something or the other. It’s a source of entertainment for me. Where is she?”</p>
<p>“She went to bed early,” said Pon, “Should I inform her of your arrival?’</p>
<p>“No,” said Alexcent, “It’s alright. Let her sleep.”</p>
<p>Alexcent appreciated the paintings on the wall. He stood fixated on a particular painting. It looked a little bit like a person and a bit like a monster. Alexcent frowned.</p>
<p>“What is this odd-looking painting?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Ah! Madam said it is a portrait of you, My Lord,” said Pon.</p>
<p>“What?! How so?” exclaimed Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Ahem. I suppose her artwork carries its own uniqueness that I dare not judge,” said Pon.</p>
<p>“Was it her idea to frame them in the corridor?”</p>
<p>“No. That was my idea,” said Pon proudly. “It’s to showcase Madam’s talent.”</p>
<p>“You’re getting a pay cut this month,” grimaced Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Sorry?!” Pon didn’t feel that was fair, but he couldn’t say it to Alexcent. He followed Alexcent with slumped shoulders.</p>
<p>“Have a room prepared where Ash can paint in peace,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lord,” said Pon, and lamented at another late night of work.</p>
