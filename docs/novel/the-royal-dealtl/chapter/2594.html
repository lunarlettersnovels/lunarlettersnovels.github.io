            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 78</strong></p>
<p><em>Huh, what the hell!! Is this a joke? Might as well buy a vehicle with that money.</em></p>
<p>“It’s too expensive,” she blurted out, never one to hide her heart.</p>
<p>“What?! Madam, the dresses you possess in your closet are… No, way more than that one.”</p>
<p>“Huh?!” She fired back with one word of surprise at Lunia’s comment.</p>
<p>“Compared to one I bought a few days ago, this is rather cheap.”</p>
<p>“Oh, was it that expensive?”</p>
<p><em>Did they really know? That the dress was that expensive? How could they just buy without thinking twice? Wait, were they going to buy everything here? Seriously…!?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst, who hadn’t known it’d be this expensive, became flustered. Her heart was incessantly throbbing through her chest and she ended up not buying the dress.</p>
<p>Lunia was upset with her mistress’s strangely thrifty behaviour. She said, “Madam, with all of the merchants at the mansion, if you don’t purchase anything now… a bad rumor could probably spread.”</p>
<p>“Bad rumor?” Amethyst quirked her eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Correct. The duke’s influence has declined, and it’s not like what it used to be… There will be all sorts of stories floating around. And if those get around to the duke, he will be furious.” Lunia explained.</p>
<p>“Ummm, yeah but… this is overkill. A dress that costs 90,000 ars—”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about the price, just choose one. Isn’t what you like most important, Lady Amethyst?”</p>
<p>Amethyst couldn’t easily abandon the habits she had formed through the years in her previous life. So she was unaware all of the time.</p>
<p><em>My choice…!</em></p>
<p><em>All right, whatever I want. I’m supposed to do whatever, as much as I like!</em></p>
<p><em>It’s not even my money anyway!</em></p>
<p>As Alexcent’s indifferent countenance floated through her mind, her chest flared up. <em>The man had so much money, this will be just a tear in a bucket for him.</em></p>
<p><em>No, not this. Let this be one big ‘F*CK YOU’!</em></p>
<p>“Good! I’ll take that red dress.” She declared resolutely.</p>
<p>“All right, what a splendid choice.” Lunia was relieved now.</p>
<p>“And that dress, this one, the light blue one, all of them!!”</p>
<p>A pleased smile spread across Lunia’s face as she nodded. The merchant also bowed her head in delight.</p>
<p>Amethyst found it difficult at first, but the next time she was sure it would be a cakewalk. Thanks to Lunia’s assistance, she was able to grasp the nuances of it all. She went on to choose and buy with nary a care… accessories, hats, gloves, etc., whatever she liked.</p>
<p>She was thrilled to have a shopping cart full of things she wanted on such a stressful day. Although she never made the payment herself, it still made her feel better.</p>
<p>Amethyst had only just utilized her shopping skills… She couldn’t believe she bought anything she wanted without having to worry about money. The exhilarating pleasure evoked a breathtaking relief. It seemed true that the rich really didn’t look at price tags when they shopped.</p>
<p>“These gloves go with this dress. How about them?”</p>
<p>“Hmmm, I think the gloves with the white lace look better than those. Wait, just give me everything!”</p>
<p>“Yes Madam. Then we’ll buy all the gloves here.”</p>
<p>“All right. Splendid!”</p>
<p>Next up were shoes.</p>
<p>In fact, Amethyst had loved dress shoes since even before her marriage. Since she was rather petite, she always wore at least a seven-inch heel; high heels were like pride. She changed them out for low heels and sneakers when she had a baby. Sandals in the summer were a luxury. And sandals she could easily slip on and off were the best.</p>
<p>Not long after her gaze fell on the shoe section, her eyes began to shine and twinkle. She picked the shoes directly in front of her- a pink pair of open-toe shoes with a ribbon tied above the heel… bright red Mary Jane-style shoes with straps around the back… suede… dark rose brown slip-on with an ankle strap… And how could she miss the wedge shoes with natural beige-toned natural soles… D’Orsay shoes with a low-cut front that showed part of a woman’s toes looked the best in black. Every woman needed at least one pair!</p>
<p>“I’ll take these!”</p>
<p>And then there was the long, leather boots she’d yearned for so long…</p>
<p>Different from the ‘old her’, Amethyst was ecstatic to be able to buy whatever without having to worry.</p>
<p><em>What in the world! I didn’t expect there would be a day I can wear these long boots! I can’t believe it!</em></p>
<p><em>Really…  My legs will be killers in these!!!</em></p>
<p>For someone who used to have thunder thighs, Amethyst now drooled over her own legs.</p>
<p>“Lunia, I want every color and length of boots in this style.”</p>
<p>“Yes Madam.”</p>
<p>“And comfy shoes, just in case you didn’t know. Especially loafers!”</p>
<p>Lunia steadily wrote down the items Amethyst had chosen and handed them to the merchant.</p>
<p>“Now, I want to see something else—”</p>
<p>Everyone knows- if you’re going to spend money like no tomorrow, you had better look at jewelry!</p>
<p>“Which should I choose?” Amethyst queried.</p>
<p>“It’d be best to see a jeweler.” Lunia suggested.</p>
<p>“Right. I’ll ask the merchant to ready them soon. Should I order you some tea while you wait?” Lunia said.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’d be good.”</p>
<p>After she had taken a few sips of the tea brought in by a maid, a jeweler entered. There was only one small box in the merchant’s hands.</p>
<p>“Welcome, My Lady. I’m Dunph, a jeweler from Diana Jewels. It’s such an honor to meet you like this.” The man courteously greeted.</p>
<p>She set the teacup on the table and replied, “Yes, pleased to meet you. Mr. Dunph.”</p>
<p>“Please, just call me Dunph.” He smiled.</p>
<p>“Will do. Thank you. By the way, this is much less than what I thought you’d prepare. I called you because I want to purchase some jewelry, but—” She spoke as she eyed the box in his hand.</p>
<p>“Oh, actually… I brought this because it’s only to be shown to the wife of a duke.”</p>
<p>“For me? But I’ve never made a purchase before.” Amethyst was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>“Yes, and that… This necklace is a present from Lord du Skad.” Dunph proceeded to open the box he was holding.</p>
<p>In no time, the necklace sitting neatly atop of the high-end fabric caught everyone’s attention. A red jewel the size of a baby’s fist adorned between two smaller jewels on either sides was soon presented before the lady. It hung upon an elaborately carved palladium rope, a very rare metal more precious than platinum- transparent and bold, shining brilliantly.</p>
<p><em>At this rate… shouldn’t it be registered as a national treasure? Such a necklace is mine!? From Alex?!</em></p>
<p>“Is… Is this really for me?” Amethyst meekly asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lady.”</p>
<p>The jewelry simply replied while Amethyst stood there with a dumbfounded look on her face.</p>
