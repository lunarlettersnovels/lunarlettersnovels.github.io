            <p><strong>Chapter 166</strong></p>
<p><em>I didn’t realize the true Amethyst was so popular, </em>she thought.<em>Everyone says they will make time for me, no matter how busy they are.</em></p>
<p>“Then I guess I can stay for a bit.”</p>
<p>Count Lohikin only then seemed to acknowledge Alexcent’s presence. “I’m sorry. How awful of me. I only greeted my daughter. Pardon my rudeness, Prince Skad. Please take a seat.”</p>
<p>“Do not worry about it,” Alexcent replied, politely.</p>
<p>Amethyst held on to Count Lohikin’s arm as they sat on the sofa, side by side.</p>
<p>“Do you still have to work late most days?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“No. I have a bit more freedom as Congress has not gone into session yet.”</p>
<p>“Mother had been concerned about your health from the late nights. I hope you are feeling more like yourself?”</p>
<p>“Of course! What about you, are you well?” Count Lohikin studied Amethyst’s face, watching her reaction to his question.</p>
<p>“I’m probably the definition of health,” she replied, realizing she may have made a mistake.</p>
<p>““Oh darling, don’t you recall when you were younger!” Count Lohikin reminded her.</p>
<p><em>I don’t know anything about when I was younger. Was I ill a lot? Maybe, he didn’t notice my slip up. Let’s just try to pass it smoothly.</em></p>
<p>However, Alexcent showed interest and didn’t let the topic go. “When she was younger?” he asked.</p>
<p>“She was always a weak child, often developing fevers. That’s why my wife and I were always concerned. We doted on her and spoiled her too much, which is why she tends to be bull-headed sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Father! There’s no need to say such things.” Amethyst was aghast at what she was hearing.</p>
<p>Count Lohikin laughed. “I guess I’ve embarrassed you now.” Thankfully, Count Lohikin hadn’t spoke of a specific memory. Amethyst sighed at narrowly avoiding a crisis.</p>
<p>“That must be why you were scolded by the countess,” Alexcent teased Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Sorry? Really, is there anyone who grew up without getting scolded some time?” Amethyst was feeling attacked.</p>
<p>“I see,” Alexcent smirked.</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about something else! And stop teasing me.” Amethyst had got her back up and the others felt it was time to move to a new topic.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s do that,” Count Lohikin agreed, trying to quell the situation. “How is life at the mansion? Is it difficult? I’m curious, since you don’t have any experience.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine and I’m doing well. Everyone treats me kindly. There is no need for you to worry,” Amethyst assure her father.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief.” Count Lohikin seemed genuinely concerned.</p>
<p>“Recently I started drawing.” Amethyst, once again, quickly changed the topic of conversation. For the rest of the afternoon, they spoke of trivial things. Alexcent seemed relieved that he had misinterpreted things but couldn’t let go of the nagging feeling that something was amiss.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After the close call with her father, Amethyst swore to herself that she would live every day as if it was her last and loved Alexcent every moment she could. For once, she was awake when he got up in the morning. She sat up and leaned against the headboard, watching Alexcent dress.</p>
<p>She asked, “Are you going to be late today?”</p>
<p>“Probably not,” he answered</p>
<p>“Then you’ll be here for dinner?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ll try.”</p>
<p>“Trying is not good enough,” she nagged.</p>
<p>Alexcent laughed. “Alright, I will be here.” He kissed her and exited the bedroom to start his day. He didn’t dislike the change he was seeing in Amethyst, but still wasn’t fully content as there continued to seem to be a distance between them.</p>
<p>It was still pitch-black outside, and no one else was awake. Gen showed up at his office to give the day’s report. Alexcent sighed heavily, causing Gen to hesitate. A sigh was always troublesome, and Gen wondered what the matter was.</p>
<p>Gen finally mustered up the courage and asked, “What is it my lord?”</p>
<p>“Something is wrong with Ash,” Alexcent replied.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Gen had no idea what Alexcent was talking about.</p>
<p>“How should I put it? It’s like she’s rejecting me?”</p>
<p>Gen couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Did you sleep in separate rooms last night?”</p>
<p>“No. It was great. Last night, Ash was on top.”</p>
<p>“My Lord! I apologize, but I do not wish to hear about the private details of the happenings in your bedroom.”</p>
<p>Alexcent ignored Gen’s protests. “Looking up at her from below was heart-stopping beautiful. And furthermore….”</p>
<p>“My Lord!! Please!” Gen shuffled uncomfortably. He just wanted to make his report and leave.</p>
<p>“But something is not right. We’re so close, and yet it feels like she’s pushing me away.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?” Gen asked.</p>
<p>“Precisely. What do I mean by that?” Alex knew she wanted him, but it was like she won’t give over her heart. <em>Does she want me just for my body? </em>Alexcent thought. <em>I hope that is not the case.</em></p>
<p>“My lord, please focus.” Gen desperately tried to get the man back on track.</p>
<p>“Sorry.” Alexcent tried to clear the thoughts from his head. “Pleas continue.”</p>
<p>Gen placed a document in front of him. “This is the list of the newly recruited knights. They will be arriving at the mansion shortly, so we need to prepare for their welcome and accommodations.</p>
<p>“I see. Is it that time of the year already?” Alexcent had completely lost track of the days.</p>
<p>“Yes. They need to be settled in the mansion before the hunting competition begins.”</p>
<p>“How many are there this year?”</p>
<p>“Five. As always, we recruited the minimum number. Their skills should be adequate.”</p>
<p>“Skills are a given. Is there one that stands out?” Alec was hoping for a champion.</p>
