            <p><strong>Chapter 170</strong></p>
<p>The new knights that would be receiving appointment letters looked nervous compared to the seasoned knights.  Amethyst and Alec stood at the front, waiting to greet the knights. Gen made his way to the front of the stage, as he would be the master of the ceremonies.</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded greetings to Sir Hill, Leyrian, and Buer, who all stood at attention and were the signs of professionalism.</p>
<p>As she scanned the soldiers, her eyes fell on Lunia who was wearing a uniform and standing between the division commanders. Lunia’s eyes met hers and she responded with a funny smile. Lunia was a tenth division commander. That’s how she knew so much about the new knights. She wasn’t just an assistant. Lunia definitely hid this fact to surprise her. Amethyst replied with a ‘you got me’ smile.</p>
<p>As the ceremony went on, Amethyst slowly looked over the knights one by one, greeting them with a nod if her eyes met anyone’s. She could feel someone watching her. Scanning the crowd her eyes me the one Lunia mentioned – Sir Barden Crenson.</p>
<p><em>Why does he keep looking at me? Does he know me?</em> She tried to avoid looking at him, but his gaze continued to stay on her. It felt awkward. It was beginning to bother her, so she shifted her focus to Alec. Her body began to calm as she looked into her husband’s eyes.</p>
<p>Alexcent mouthed the word ‘What?’ and his face showed concern. Amethyst nodded slightly to let him know that she was all right.</p>
<p>Gen’s quick progress through the appointment letter presentation ended with the greetings from the duke and duchess. The new knights stood in front of Alexcent and Amethyst the moment their names were announced.</p>
<p>“Barden Crenson!” Gen called.</p>
<p><em>Crenson?</em> The name nagged at Amethyst’s mind once more. <em>Marquis Crenson!</em> <em>My god!</em> <em>Barden Crenson was the man that I had almost been promised to in marriage!</em>Amethyst remembered her father talking about the family as he planned an arranged marriage. She hadn’t known his name, but her father had mentioned it was Marquis Crenson’s second child, so it must be him. That’s why he was staring at her. He knew her. So why did he come to be a knight with the duke? Barden’s never met her and doesn’t know her name.</p>
<p>As Amethyst was lost in her thoughts, she could hear herself being addressed. She refocused and realized Lunia was trying to get her attention.</p>
<p>“Hand! Give him your hand!” Lunia was hissing from the side.</p>
<p>Smiling foolishly, Amethyst held out her hand tentatively. Barden kneeled, as was proper, and kissed the back of her outstretched hand. Then he returned to his original post.</p>
<p>The rest of the knights were called upon in succession, greeting Alexcent and kissing the back of Amethyst’s hand. Alexcent’s mood seemed to darken after every kiss, and she could see the pinnacle of jealousy by the last. The knights could sense his mood and became nervous as they didn’t know why. There was a general unease amongst them when the ceremony was over.  The knights disappeared as quickly as they could.</p>
<p>Amethyst caught up with Lunia, before she left. “Lunia! How could you?”</p>
<p>Lunia laughed. “Were you surprised?”</p>
<p>“Of course! My goodness, you’re a knight!”</p>
<p>“It’s an interlock. With the assistant position.”</p>
<p>“That’s not just an interlock!” Amethyst couldn’t believe how humble Lunia was being.  “Division commander! Why didn’t you tell me? You should’ve told me when I was training!”</p>
<p>“There was no reason too, at the time. Even though I’m a division commander, my skill is the lowest. The Duke and Chief Commander Hill are teaching you personally, so why would I butt in?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have wanted to learn from Alec or Sir Hill. I would have liked to learn from you. I’m really disappointed.” Amethyst was putting Lunia on. She figured, since Lunia tricked her, she would trick Lunia.</p>
<p>“Huh?! Ma’am, please forgive me,” Lunia started protesting.</p>
<p>Amethyst ignored her pleading and continued. “I guess my skill was so pitiful, that you didn’t want to have anything to do with me.”</p>
<p>“No. That’s a misunderstanding!”</p>
<p>“I had such hard time learning from Alec who has no skill in teaching.”</p>
<p>“Ma’am, I’m sorry!” Lunia didn’t know what else to say, as she watched Amethyst begin to tear up. Then the tears turned to giggles.</p>
<p>“What’s so funny?” Alexcent asked, having joined the ladies.</p>
<p>“I’m messing with Lunia,” Amethyst said, laughing harder.</p>
<p>“Ma’am!” Lunia realized that she’d been played and gave Amethyst a look of resentment.</p>
<p>“Is today’s schedule over?” Amethyst asked</p>
<p>“Yes,” Lunia replied, still recovering from the joke that had been played on her.</p>
<p>“Well then, Sir Lunia, I’ll see you later.” Amethyst gave her a mocking salute.</p>
<p>“Of course. Ma’am,” Lunia replied, through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Amethyst and Alexcent, leaving Lunia behind, grasped hands and head off to the Duke’s Mansion.</p>
