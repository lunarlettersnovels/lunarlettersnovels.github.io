            <p><strong>Chapter 307</strong></p>
<p>“Pian.”</p>
<p>The hall was silent as Gen crossed his arms and sighed. “Pian,” he repeated, rolling his eyes. “If you don’t answer me now, I’ll cut your budget.”</p>
<p>Then, out of the darkness, a petulant reply came. “You can’t!”</p>
<p>Gen smiled to himself. “That’s more like it,” he said. “Now, let me into your room.”</p>
<p>Pian’s room was closed off, stopping Gen from coming inside right at the door. No one else ventured into the room after a maid had gone in once and ended up sick. It was only Gen who visited nowadays, and, even then, it wasn’t because he wanted to.</p>
<p>“Come in,” Pian said, reluctantly letting Gen inside. He watched as the other man stepped into the room, careful as always. “What brings you here?”</p>
<p>Gen rubbed the crease in his forehead. “I need you to make it.”</p>
<p>Pian blinked. “Make what?”</p>
<p>“The transformation potion,” Gen answered, looking around the room—it was a messy, miserable place. There was no room more fitting for Pian, he thought.</p>
<p>Pian’s face broke out into a smile. “Ah!” he said in glee, rubbing his hands together. “I see it was a success last time.”</p>
<p>The wizard brushed some bottles and a seemingly random assortment of items from his table with the back of his arm. He didn’t seem phased at all as everything came crashing down to the floor.</p>
<p>“You know,” he continued, smile only growing wider. “I’ve actually improved on it since last time. The pain will be significantly less now.”</p>
<p>“That’s not good,” Gen muttered under his breath.</p>
<p>Pian hummed. “Pardon?”</p>
<p>All Gen did was shake his head. “Nothing.”</p>
<p>Turning back to the work on his table, Pian continued. “So do you have any preferences?”</p>
<p>“Gray and narrow eyes,” Gen said. “A lower nose and a lighter voice.”</p>
<p>Pian stopped and looked up. “Sir Gen?”</p>
<p>Gen looked at him expectantly. “What?”</p>
<p>“Who’s drinking this?” Pain asked cautiously. “It’s the duke, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Gen answered, humorlessly.</p>
<p>There was no magic greater than that of the empress, Gen knew. He wouldn’t have believed it to be true if he hadn’t seen it personally. He knew that no matter how great the potion turned out to be, it would not be anything like something the empress would make. But he didn’t care to explain this to Pian.</p>
<p>“Just make it, will you?” Gen said impatiently.</p>
<p>“Well, the duke’s physique is quite amazing,” Pian told him, walking over to one of his shelves and picking out a small bottle. “Unless I carve his bones, it won’t really work.”</p>
<p>Gen shrugged. “I assumed as much.”</p>
<p>Holding the bottle out to Gen, Pian hesitated. “I have to tell you that it might have… a side effect.”</p>
<p>Gen took the bottle in his hands and studied it intently. “A side effect?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Pian said. “It might lower a male’s ability to—” he stopped himself, shaking his head. “If you gave me more time, I could perfect the potion and remove the side effect.”</p>
<p>Gen’s eyes shone as he stared down at the bottle. This was just the thing he needed to get revenge on that miserable man. He had always disregarded his work.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, smiling at the wizard. “This should do just fine.”</p>
<p>Pian frowned. “Just tell the duke he won’t be able to perform like he normally can.”</p>
<p>Gen nodded, turning to leave the room. “Will do.”</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Gen gave Alexcent the potion bottle. “Pian says that there won’t be pain like last time.”</p>
<p>Alexcent turned the bottle over in his hands and looked up at Gen. “Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Gen nodded, lips curling into a smile. He could have explained the <em>other</em> side effect that Pian had told him about, but he didn’t. Alexcent didn’t need to know.</p>
<p>“That’s great,” the prince said. He didn’t care much about the pain, but he knew that Amethyst had been worried about it last time and he would rather not have to deal with that again.</p>
<p>Saying his goodbyes to Gen, Alexcent stepped out of his office and into the hallway where Amethyst was already walking towards him.</p>
<p>“Ash!” Alexcent exclaimed as Amethyst drew near.</p>
<p>She grinned. “Alec,” she said. “I was looking for you.”</p>
<p>“I was looking for you too,” Alexcent confessed, his voice a little giddy.</p>
<p>“Really?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>The prince smiled. “Of course.” He would be lying if he said he didn’t think they were soulmates.</p>
<p>Then, Amethyst’s smile faded as her features grew serious. She frowned. “Listen,” she said. “I have something to say.”</p>
<p>Before she could continue, Alexcent raised a hand to stop her. “Let me speak first,” he told her. “Close your eyes.”</p>
<p>Hesitantly, Amethyst did as she was told.</p>
<p>“You might feel a little dizzy,” she heard Alexcent mumble as his arms wrapped around her. She breathed in his scent and pulled herself closer to him as she felt her body begin to float. A warm gust of wind washed over her, then she was back on the ground</p>
<p>“You can open your eyes now,” Alexcent said, his voice gentle and quiet.</p>
<p>Slowly, Amethyst opened her eyes and found herself in front of a still river. She gasped. “Alec, is this…” she trailed off, unable to find the words.</p>
<p>Alexcent smiled. “It is.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was stunned. In the blink of an eye, they had gone from the palace to the edge of the Empire. It wasn’t exactly what she had expected.</p>
<p>“Is this really Hutchmoon?” she asked, just to be sure.</p>
