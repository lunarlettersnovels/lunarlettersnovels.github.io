            <p><strong>Chapter 174</strong></p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“I’m inviting you to dinner today.”</p>
<p>“I know,” said him, “But why?”</p>
<p>“It will be good if we all sit and eat together,” said Amethyst, “He might agree to the duel too, seeing you there.” <em>It’s better for them to get acquainted with each other first.</em></p>
<p>“It’s really alright,” said Barden, “You don’t have to.”</p>
<p>“Please, I insist,” said Amethyst, “Let’s have dinner together.”</p>
<p>“I, uh…” Barden was at a loss for words. He didn’t know how to refuse Amethyst.</p>
<p>“You can think of it as a reward,” suggested Amethyst, “For teaching me swordsmanship.”</p>
<p>“I taught you because I wanted to,” said Barden, “You don’t have to do this. I am fine, really.”</p>
<p>“It is impolite to keep refusing an offer,” teased Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>“Then I will see you later.”</p>
<p>Barden reluctantly nodded. Amethyst smiled brightly and left the training ground.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Why are you here?” Alexcent’s low voice asked. He then turned to Amethyst. “Did you just come back?” he asked.</p>
<p>Amethyst received him in her drawing room. He glared at Barden, who bowed respectfully. “Greetings, My Lord,” said Barden, “I am Barden Crayson. I am the newly appointed—”</p>
<p>“That was not my question,” said Alexcent, “Is there a reason why you are here?”</p>
<p>“My apologies, my lord,” said Barden, “I was invited by her Ladyship for dinner.”</p>
<p>“Invited?” asked Alexcent as he turned to Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes, Alec,” said Amethyst, “I invited him.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amethyst, “During the holiday, Barden taught me swordsmanship. So, in return, I thought I could invite him to have dinner with us as a token of gratitude.”</p>
<p><em>Since when did she began calling him by his name so casually? </em>Alexcent was displeased with the present situation. He observed them. An unidentifiable tension flowed between them.</p>
<p>“Don’t just stand there,” said Amethyst, “Come sit down. We can talk and eat.”</p>
<p><em>Where the hell is Lunia? </em>Alexcent thought. <em>Why is this guy sitting here at all? </em>The current situation wasn’t doing anything to improve his mood. The fact that another man was here at Amethyst’s drawing room irritated him to no extent. A man she called by his first name.</p>
<p>Amethyst grabbed his arm and pulled him down to a chair. Roman and other maids served the food. If Lunia was here, she would have steeped in to stop Amethyst but without her, nobody could stop Amethyst.</p>
<p>Roman felt the tension in the room. She was so nervous that she moved very carefully around the table so she wouldn’t aggravate the situation by any of her mistakes. She feared the duke.</p>
<p>“Barden taught me really well, you know?” said Amethyst, “I think he is very skilled at teaching.”</p>
<p>Amethyst thought that praising Barden would help get him on Alexcent’s good side. That would definitely bring them closer.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amethyst, “He explains everything step by step, making it easier to learn anything.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be surprised to see my skills later, Alec.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t really do anything much,” said Barden, “Madam had strong foundations, so I simply helped her to adjust a few forms and postures.”</p>
<p>“Aww, how humble,” said Amethyst, “You really are skilled and qualified. You graduated top of the class from the Royal academy, and you don’t lack in looks as well as character. How perfect you are.”</p>
<p>Unaware of Alexcent’s feelings, Amethyst praised Barden to the skies but would make eye contact with Alexcent occasionally and direct a smile at him. Alexcent felt himself becoming more and more upset. He was getting angry, but he kept himself in check. He wanted this dinner to end quickly so he could go away. <em>Otherwise, I might just snap his neck right now.</em></p>
<p>Roman, who was carrying the food and serving near them, was at a loss for words as she watched Amethyst at the table. She hoped for the dinner to end quickly, otherwise the knight actually might get killed.</p>
<p>Somehow only Amethyst seemed to be the one unaware of the tension that even Roman had sensed.</p>
<p>“Which was why I was wondering, Alec, why don’t you have a duel with Barden?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“A duel,” Amethyst answered curtly.</p>
<p>Alexcent stiffened. “I’m busy.”</p>
<p>“Then you can do it when you are free,” persisted Amethyst, “Besides you agreed to a duel with Count Glacia at her request. Why are you rejecting my request?”</p>
<p>“Count Glacia was…” He trailed off. He was speechless. <em>Why did I duel Count Glacia if it wasn’t for you? How can she accuse me without understanding why I did it? </em>Alexcent was too upset to explain himself.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I can’t. I am very busy,” said Alexcent. He glared at Barden. He was the reason for all this.</p>
<p>“Madam, it’s really alright,” said Barden, “A meal like this is more than enough.”</p>
<p>“I improved a great deal, thanks to you,” said Amethyst, “I want to repay you somehow. If there is anything I can do to repay you, don’t hesitate to tell me.”</p>
<p><em>What the hell is she saying? </em>Seethed Alexcent. He was already dissatisfied that two of them were practicing together. But thinking about her so willing to help him personally left a bad taste in his mouth. <em>Should I just snap his neck and make it look like an accident? That sounds like a good idea.</em></p>
<p>“If that is what you really want, then I will make sure to set some time aside,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Really?” asked Amethyst, surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Alec!” exclaimed Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much!” said Barden, gratefully.</p>
<p>Barden was so delighted. He didn’t think this was possible at all. Amethyst turned to Barden. “Good luck!”</p>
<p>Nobody knew of Alexcent’s intentions.</p>
