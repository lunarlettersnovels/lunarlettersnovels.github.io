            <p><strong>Chapter 301</strong></p>
<p>“The Prince?”</p>
<p>She could see Alexcent holding the book. He carelessly looked at its contents.</p>
<p>“I was looking for precedent somewhere else just in case. To persuade others… Nothing’s better than a precedent.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t give up?”</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p>Alexcent raised his eyebrow and gave Amethyst the book. He also asked what she was curious about after receiving the book.</p>
<p>“But are you also thinking the same thing?”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“About what we talked about. Are you also thinking like other masters that it won’t have a chance? Is that why you’re disagreeing?”</p>
<p>“Disagreeing?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I never disagreed.”</p>
<p>“But you didn’t say anything just now. So you’re agreeing?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Amethyst’s vein popped on her forehead at Alexcent’s refusal. It looked like she was trying her best to speak calmly.</p>
<p>“Then…”</p>
<p>“Why through the congress.”</p>
<p><em>Why? What does he mean?</em> Amethyst felt alleviated and asked.</p>
<p>“What? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s annoying. I can just use the empress’s power.”</p>
<p>Ah! She was forgetting it. That this man’s only sister is the Empress. Her mind went blank like she was hit by a club. Amethyst looked up at him.</p>
<p>“Then why were you acting so angry…”</p>
<p>“I didn’t like how you were caring about anything other than me.”</p>
<p>“No way! That was the only reason why you embarrassed me?”</p>
<p>Alexcent changed the subjec as she shouted with annoyance. “I scanned it for a bit and it seemed like you put a lot of effort in it. Just needs a bit of polishing.”</p>
<p>“You looked at it? I still have lots to work on. So, could you get me the management document of the Academy?”</p>
<p>Alexcent didn’t like as she immediately started working again.</p>
<p>“You see. This is why I didn’t say anything.”</p>
<p>“You see. You definitely disagreed.”</p>
<p>They scoffed after exchanging glances. Then Amethyst remembered that they were in the library hence the space between the bookshelves was narrow. Alexcent and she was quite close to each other.</p>
<p>She started smiling as if she thought of something funny.</p>
<p>She remembered a scene that only a teen movie would have.</p>
<p>“Alec.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Kiss me. Now.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Alexcent held the bookshelf above her head, then lowered his head and put his lips on hers. Amethyst grabbed his sleeves and pulled him closer.</p>
<p>Their shadow graced the wall in front of them as the setting sun lit up the bookshelf.</p>
<p>Their lips moved in harmony and their breathing got heavier.</p>
<p>“Miss Amethyst!” Amethyst quickly pushed him away from herself as she heard someone call for her.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Amethyst gasped, out of breath.</p>
<p>Alexcent glared at the owner of the voice as he wasn’t pleased with being interrupted, while his wife was flustered and quickly straightened up her clothes.</p>
<p>“Oh, my apologies for interrupting. I heard you were here.”</p>
<p>It was the Countess Citri, accompanies with other noble ladies. They bowed to Alexcent. “Greetings, My Lord Duke.”</p>
<p>Alexcent ignored them. “I’ll be off then.” He kissed Amethyst on the forehead and left.</p>
<p>“We’re really sorry. We didn’t know you were with the duke.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“We thought of something on our way back. How about we establish it ourselves?!”</p>
<p>“Ourselves?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We’ll build it in our own territory first and gradually convince the other nobles after. The land problem would also be solved. Count Glacia said he does not disagree with the idea, so we’ll be able to build at least six education facilities in the Empire.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. And if things run smoothly, we might be able to recommend more branches opening up in the empire later.”</p>
<p>A private education facility. How did they think of something like this? <em>They truly are much more accomplished than me.</em></p>
<p>To be able to meet such good people, Amethyst felt very lucky. She smiled</p>
<p>“Ah, but there’s an issue.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Yes, but how did you know?”</p>
<p>“Well, Count Glacia has changed quite a lot. You… became more comfortable. We can really sense it when you’re with Lupes.”</p>
<p>Count Glacia blushed.</p>
<p>“Yes. When I’m with him, I feel more comfortable for some reason. I let go of all the greed and ambition.”</p>
<p>“Ah, there truly are people like that.”</p>
<p>“He is like that to me. He said that if you live a righteous life then it becomes comfortable…. That life isn’t hard. If you accept it as it is and live truly righteously.”</p>
<p>Thankfully Lupes was leading her to a more noble way of life.</p>
<p>“That’s great that you’ve met someone like that. You could be seeing anyone but it’s hard to find people that influence you positively.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Count Glacia bowed to show gratitude at her consideration.</p>
<p>“It still wouldn’t have been easy though.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“To accept Lupes. In any way or manner”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing more gracious than respecting people because you’d like the same respect to be shown to you and your partner. You feel respected if your partner is respected.”</p>
<p>It was a heavy blow to Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“You’re on a different level as me. I was…”</p>
<p>“It was in the past and you’ve apologized. Past isn’t important, the future is. Let’s not get hung up on the past.”</p>
<p>Count Glacia sighed, then smiled at Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Anyway, how did you two meet?” Amethyst inquired.</p>
<p>“He’s a distant relative. I sent my aide on vacation as he wasn’t feeling well and he recommended Lupes. I looked down on him since I thought he was just a kid at first.”</p>
<p>Amethyst paid attention to every detail as it felt like she was reading a romance novel.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was some commotion, and a knight urgently ran into the tent. “We have an emergency!”</p>
<p>“What? What is it?”</p>
<p>“The demons are coming this way! You must evacuate immediately.”</p>
<p>“Demons?”</p>
<p>“Yes. There’s no time.”</p>
