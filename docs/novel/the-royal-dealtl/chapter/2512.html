            <p><strong>Chapter 156</strong></p>
<p>“Just keep kneading this dough until it is smooth,” instructed Amethyst.</p>
<p>“What is ‘kneading’?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“You keep pushing it with the heel of your hand,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“How long?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Until it gets smooth and soft,” she said.</p>
<p>She showed him how to do it the right way. Leaving him with the dough, she went over to check the broth. It needed to boil a little more. Meanwhile, she chopped the potatoes, zucchini, and carrots. She also diced some spring onion to go with the broth.</p>
<p>“How is it going?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“How is what?” asked him.</p>
<p>“Kneading, is it doable?” she asked, “Are you having fun?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said, “It’s weird.”</p>
<p>“Weird?” asked Amethyst, curious.</p>
<p>“It is soft, and smooth, and white. It feels like human skin,” he said.</p>
<p>“What?!” exclaimed Amethyst and burst out laughing. “Don’t get lustful over a dough! Bring it here.”</p>
<p>“How dare you?” joked Alexcent, “Who is even getting lustful?” He brought the dough over to Amethyst.</p>
<p>Amethyst added the potatoes in the broth first. They would take the longest to cook. She waited for the broth to come to a boil. She took the dough from Alexcent and tore small chunks of the dough and put them into the broth. “See?” she said, “You tear small chunks and put them in the broth to cook. Can you do it?”</p>
<p>“I will try my best,” he said.</p>
<p>“Here, give it a try,” she said holding out the dough to him.</p>
<p>Alexcent tore a small chunk, but the dough was sticky enough to get stuck on his hands. He was shaking his hands to get it off his fingers, hoping it would get unstuck and drop into the broth to no avail.</p>
<p>“Ash,” he said.</p>
<p>“What?” Amethyst turned to find him struggling. He had shaken his hands so hard that the dough had flown into his hair, some had landed on his shoulders, too. She burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“Ugh, it’s sticky,” he complained.</p>
<p>“Wait, don’t shake your hands,” she said, chuckling. “Hold still.” She picked the pieces of dough from his hair and shoulders. “You are impossible!” she teased, “I will do it. Give me the dough. Pass me the chopped vegetables from there.” She gestured to the plate of vegetables on the table.</p>
<p>Alexcent grumbled and passed her the plate. Amethyst poured all the vegetables into the broth and seasoned it with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>After a while, Amethyst said, “Hhmm… Looks like it’s done. Smells great!”</p>
<p>She took the pot and placed it on the table in the kitchen, “Come and sit down, Alec.”</p>
<p>“You want to eat here?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Sure,” she said, “It’s better to eat it while it’s still hot. Come.”</p>
<p>He walked over to the table and sat down opposite to her. “Try it and tell me how you like it,” she said as she took her share in a bowl.</p>
<p>Alexcent gingerly scooped a spoonful and ate it. He furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>“How is it?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“It’s… slippery and… soft,” he said.</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed. “Isn’t it chewy?”</p>
<p>“Do you like this?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, “Don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know yet.”</p>
<p>“I like it very much,” she said as she brought another spoonful to her mouth</p>
<p>They ate in silence. When Amethyst finished her share and looked at Alexcent’s bowl, she found the vegetables and cooked dough still in his bowl. He had only eaten the soup. <em>He always tells me not to be picky with my food… and now…</em></p>
<p>Amethyst found it amusing that even Alexcent had something that he couldn’t finish.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That night Amethyst changed into her night shift and laid down on the bed. As she closed her eyes she was reminded of the maid and the baby she had encountered in the afternoon while taking a walk. She remembered what she had said to her. “There might be many more days that might be rougher than today,” she had said, “Just don’t give up.” What she hadn’t said was, <em>don’t run away like I did.</em></p>
<p>She hadn’t exactly come to this place out of her own freewill, but she had indeed used it as a place where she could run away from her life. She had been a mother. And she had wished to leave everything behind and disappear.</p>
<p>She felt guilty and felt like she was a bad mother. These thoughts kept hovering in her mind, and it was a long while when she finally fell asleep. Her dreams were restless. She wore a frown on her face.</p>
<p>In the dream, she was in Amethyst’s body, standing in the middle of the living room. There were crumbs of biscuits on the table and chair, the clothes were strewn all over the floor and the toys were scattered haphazardly. There was a pile of rubbish at the corner of the room that hadn’t been taken out for days.</p>
<p>A shadow formed under her and started to grow huge. The shadow was so huge that it turned into a dark figure that yelled at her: “Instead of whining all the time, why don’t you quit that work of yours and focus on the house? That would solve everything!”</p>
<p><em>That’s not it. I’m just asking for a little help…just with the dishes, or taking out the rubbish, just a little bit of help….</em></p>
<p>“Are you the only person working? Everyone else lives the same way. Everyone else is doing it so stop acting all high and mighty!” yelled the dark figure.</p>
<p><em>I just want you to understand that I’m facing challenges…</em></p>
<p>“And you should give mother a call. And visit her. Must I remind you? Why can’t you act like a real daughter?”</p>
<p><em>Then should I act like your sister? Should I sleep in, refuse to cook and just eat what is laid out for me and neglect everything?</em></p>
<p>“If you’re that sick, then go see a doctor! Really you are such a vicious person.”</p>
<p><em>When do I even have the time to go to a doctor when I have to do everything? And is it a crime to fall sick? I just want some words of comfort. Just your words…</em></p>
<p>“What is wrong with the house? I need to rest once I come home…but look at this, what do you even do all day?”</p>
<p><em>I want to rest too. After work, I’m tired too. I hate my suffocating life. I want to run away.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst groaned in agony in her sleep. Alexcent woke up, startled by the sound, and looked at her. She was tossing and turning and groaning as though in pain. She was covered in cold sweat, and tears were streaming down her face.</p>
<p>“Ash?” he called gently.</p>
<p>“I…want… run away,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>“Ash,” said Alexcent, a little louder, “Wake up.” He tried to shake her awake. “Ash!”</p>
