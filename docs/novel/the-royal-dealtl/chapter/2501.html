            <p><strong>Chapter 167</strong></p>
<p>“Hmm…not really.” Gen referred to the documents. “The only one that stood out was having someone from the Royal Academy’s senior martial arts graduating class join the Order of the Prince, not the Imperial Knights.”</p>
<p>“Really? That’s unusual.” Alexcent was curious. Originally, it was the standard that seniors and second-class graduates were the first to join the Imperial Knights. In addition, if it was someone who graduated from the academy, it meant that he was a nobleman. It was unusual that such a knight would choose to join the Order of the Prince instead of the Imperial Army.</p>
<p>Among the mercenaries, joining the Order of the Prince was much more meaningful than being a knight for the Imperial Army. They selected knights based on ability. But, for the aristocrats that valued honour, it was a different case. Because of this difference in values, there were more knights from lower social tiers, than knights from aristocratic families in the Order of the Prince. Their bond, loyalty, and solidarity were said to be of the highest value in the empire, particularly since the duke insisted on only collecting outstanding knights.</p>
<p><em>‘Recently, I don’t like how you steal everything away,’ Belice had said. Now I know what she was referring to – the knights.</em> Alexcent became aware of the situation. He confirmed the personal information of this particular knight from Gen’s documents.</p>
<p>“For the welcoming we’re having Ash with us, so relay that to Lunia.” Alexcent said as he studied the report.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” Gen agreed. The appointment ceremony of the knights was one of the important ceremonies by the royal family. It was the first time the knights met their lord. Lady Skad played a large and important role. During the appointment ceremony she only needed to be present. However, the celebration event after was to be managed and run by her. It was her opportunity to impress the other royal families, as well as meet and greet all of the new knights.</p>
<p>Alexcent passed the documents back to Gen and asked, “Is the report on Count Lohikin still not ready?”</p>
<p>“Actually, it is. That was my next order of business.” Gen took out another file. “There wasn’t anything unusual to report. It’s already what we know.”</p>
<p>“I see. I guess I was wrong.”</p>
<p>“However.” Gen continued.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Apparently, Lady Skad has always had a weak body, ever since her childhood,” Gen reported.</p>
<p>“I already knew that.” This confirmed what Alexcent had heard in Count Lohikin’s office.</p>
<p>“But, after being seriously sick before the royal ball, she has steadily become healthier.”</p>
<p>“Royal ball? You mean the first day I met her?” Alexcent remembered the day clearly.</p>
<p>“Yes. She apparently had an extremely high fever a few days before the event, but since then she hasn’t been ill.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Alexcent wondered what would have caused such a drastic change. “Perhaps she was suffering from spiritual sickness?”</p>
<p>“I doubt it. If she did then she would have become one of the Goddess’ guides before she turned 20.”</p>
<p>A spiritual sickness was imposed on those who weren’t related to the Goddess, yet had somehow inherited her blood. Even if they didn’t become a wizard, they would inherit excellent spiritual communication skills, and sometimes become overwhelmed by the strength of them. Usually, they would not be able to withstand this power and burn out, relegating them to become a member of the Goddess’ guides.</p>
<p>For a moment, Alexcent worried that was what Amethyst had. But, since she was past the age of twenty, there could be no way. As Gen said, she just had a weak body.</p>
<p>“I must tell Pon to keep an eye on her.” Alexcent wanted Amethyst looked after, in case her sickness returned.</p>
<p>“Of course. Also, about the contract you mentioned previously. There is little difference trying to annul a verbal contract and changing it to a written one. The legal effect is no different. It will be difficult to invalidate this contract, unless there is a justifiable reason.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Alexcent was disappointed with this news. “Alright. Good work.”</p>
<p>“If there is nothing else, I will take my leave for the day.” Gen began to exit.</p>
<p>“One last thing,” Alexcent said, stopping the man. “Ash will be attending the royal hunting competition, so please make sure to add her.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.” After Gen left the office, Alexcent couldn’t help but continue to feel anxious about Amethyst, which made him extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Madam, the appointment ceremony of the Skad Household knights will be held in a couple of days,” Lunia informed Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Appointment ceremony?” Amethyst had not heard of this.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s where new knights for the house are appointed. This year you must attend. Which means you must dress formally.”</p>
<p>“Formal?” Amethyst became anxious at what Lunia’s definition of formal may mean.</p>
<p>“It’s not overly grand. Your gown will be similar to your usual party dress, but adorned with a few different types of medals,” Lunia explained to her</p>
<p>“Wait. What do you mean by different types?” Alexcent was confused.</p>
<p>“There are different types of medals for formal wear. There are the ones you adorn on your shoulder, and the others go around your arm or chest,” Lunia described.</p>
<p>“You mean the sash-like things people wear diagonally across their bodies?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. If you had been appointed a knight then you would wear a sword as well but, since that isn’t the case, that won’t be necessary.</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed “It sounds complicated. Do I own any medals? I don’t recall receiving any.”</p>
<p>“You’ve never formally attended a royal event so you haven’t had to wear it, but after your wedding the empress awarded you with medals which are now being kept in the safe. You’re considered first rank, the same as his lord.”</p>
<p>“First rank?” Amethyst did not know what that meant.</p>
<p>“Yes. You can consider it one of the highest ranked medals the empress can bestow.”</p>
