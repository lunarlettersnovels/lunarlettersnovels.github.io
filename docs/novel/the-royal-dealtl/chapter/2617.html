<p>“Young Miss!”</p>
<p>As Amethyst descended the carriage, Yellie greeted her loudly.</p>
<p>“Yellie, watch your manners. She is now the wife of the prince.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I am so sorry. I was just so happy to see her….” Yellie flushed as the butler of the count’s mansion reprimanded her, but she didn’t appear apologetic at all.</p>
<p>“Huhu, it’s fine. And that’s Yellie’s charm. How have you been? Your complexion seems better. I guess you’re enjoying my absence?”</p>
<p>“No way! I cried so much because you threw me away and left me behind.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean threw you away … Some people might think it’s true!”</p>
<p>“It is true! I at least thought you would take me along with you!”</p>
<p>“That again? I already told you I can’t bring anybody into the mansion due to security reasons.”</p>
<p>“But I’m not anybody.” Yellie pouted.</p>
<p>Amethyst tried to come up with various reasons to soothe her, but her grudge seemed to hold.</p>
<p>As the two continued on and on at the front door, the butler stepped in.</p>
<p>“Welcome back Lady Skad.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Is mother inside?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She has been waiting for you.”</p>
<p><em>Ah, Pon said he would make the arrangements so he must have informed them.</em></p>
<p>It was a place she had left after spending only a couple of days, but seeing how happy Yellie was to see her, it felt like home.</p>
<p>Leaving the sad Yellie behind, she followed the butler to the count’s drawing-room.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Amethyst.”</p>
<p>“Mother.”</p>
<p>Countess Lohikin who had the same coloured hair as her daughter greeted her with a smile. Subconsciously she approached Countess Lohikin and embraced her. It felt warm and nice.</p>
<p>“I was surprised by the sudden message. By chance did you fight with the prince?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s a relief….”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you go to work today?”</p>
<p>“How could I when my daughter is coming over to visit?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… you must be busy.”</p>
<p>“No worries, no worries at all. Now look at you, you’ve become prettier!”</p>
<p>“Haha, I doubt it.”</p>
<p>Countess Lohikin grabbed a hold of Amethyst’s hand and patted it. As she could feel the concern and care of the mother who had sent her daughter off to get married, she couldn’t help but feel bad.</p>
<p><em>Maybe I should have visited more frequently…</em></p>
<p><em>No, I can’t. I can’t become weak here.</em></p>
<p>“So how is your newlywed period? Seeing how you’ve become prettier… I’m guessing the Prince is treating you well.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p><em>How should I respond… </em>Amethyst’s face flushed. <em>That he is treating super well? No, I think that only applies to the events that happen at night.</em></p>
<p>“Huhu, seeing how you are all flushed… it seems like you’re well.”</p>
<p>“Mother, that’s not it…!”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Mother knows. No need to be shy.”</p>
<p><em>Haha. Of course. I’m sure you know!</em></p>
<p><em>I better change the topic. I can’t hide from the elders. At this rate, I might end up giving away all the details!</em></p>
<p>“Actually, I wanted to visit you because… I have something to ask.”</p>
<p>“Really? What is my dear daughter curious about?”</p>
<p>“Well… Have you heard of Aran Bank?”</p>
<p>Countess Lohikin carefully studied Amethyst’s face. She had expected her naïve daughter to have questions about married life but to think that her question was on Aran Bank… She couldn’t help but feel concerned whether she was in urgent need of money.</p>
<p>“Amethyst, do you secretly have a debt with the prince?”</p>
<p>“What? No!”</p>
<p>“Then why are you suddenly asking about Aran Bank?”</p>
<p>“Well… I’ve been working on the management of the mansion and Aran Bank stood out. There were other banks too… but based on the butler I heard that this bank was not affiliated with the mansion.”</p>
<p>“Is that true?”</p>
<p>“What is?”</p>
<p>“That you found out about Aran Bank while managing the mansion?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s true. I saw that Aran Bank had paid for fixes and repairs.”</p>
<p>Amethyst felt nervous as Countess Lohikin turned solemn.</p>
<p><em>Did I… say something wrong? No matter how odd and sudden her question about Aran Bank was, the other looked too serious and tense.</em></p>
<p>“Phew! All right then that’s a relief.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“You scared me for a minute there! I thought you owed a big debt… but hold on! It’s weird that a place like the Prince’s Mansion would be affiliated with a place like Aran Bank….”</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<p>“Because Aran Bank is famously known for creating borrowed-name accounts or secret accounts in this field.”</p>
<p>“A borrowed-name account?” Amethyst was visibly surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s a place where black money comes and goes, such as slush funds and hidden assets… There must be a lot of banks owned by the Skad family, so I wonder why they are affiliated with them… I must say it is rather worrisome.”</p>
<p>“I see. Slush funds and hidden assets ….”</p>
<p>“Yes, so it may appear to be a bank… but it’s famous for creating a separate special law and not disclosing their financial details.” Countess Lohikin explained.</p>
<p>“Are banks allowed to do that?” Amethyst queried.</p>
<p>“Exactly. I was surprised to hear that they had been approved. But after them, there were no other banks that passed the bill, but it certainly is a legitimate bank that complies with the federal laws of the empire.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm. So I guess that means Aran Bank is the only option, which must be why Dajal chose it.</em></p>
<p>“Since we are on the topic, there are three banks you must never ever make deals or be associated with.”</p>
<p>“Three?” Her eyebrows quirked.</p>
<p>“Yes. Aran, Deutsche and Fidorun.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
