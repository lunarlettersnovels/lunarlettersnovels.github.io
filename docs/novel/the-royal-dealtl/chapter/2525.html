            <p><strong>Chapter 143</strong></p>
<p>“Me too,” said Baroness Zephyr, smiling bittersweetly, “My father wanted me to become a knight. Not because he had high hopes for me but because everybody else was doing it. I would sometimes run away from the training grounds into the woods. I would wander around collecting wildflowers and climbing trees. Eventually I quit swordsmanship because it wasn’t for me.”</p>
<p>“I honestly can’t believe you had such a childhood! You are so soft spoken. I can’t imagine how hard it must have felt being made to undergo taxing swordplay,” said Countess Onslow, “But I was the same. I was headstrong, free and wild. I would get lost in the woods and never come out of there if I could help it. So, this is quite fun for me.” She looked at Amethyst. “What about you Lady Skad?”</p>
<p>Amethyst thought about it. She had gone on trips with her friends but there had always been trouble. Some of them wouldn’t like the food, others would complain about the tickets being expensive, and others would hate the hotels where they stayed. It had been fun but there were always complaints and she couldn’t enjoy her time fully.</p>
<p>This trip so far had been so much fun and fulfilling. She was grateful to the ladies for being so considerate and accommodating despite small obstacles they had faced. They all seemed to enjoy the little things and it made her feel at ease. She wanted to get to know them better.</p>
<p>“Of course, I love it!” said Amethyst, “I enjoyed this trip with you all so much. Please call me Amethyst. ‘Lady Skad’ just feels so distant.”</p>
<p>“Even so…,” said one of the ladies, “How can we…”</p>
<p>“Well, we came all this way, away from the mansion, and away from all the formalities, didn’t we?” said Amethyst, “If we are still caught up with titles, then there would be no point to such a casual outing.”</p>
<p>“Then, please call me Mariana,” said Countess Onslow.</p>
<p>“Alright, Mariana,” said Amethyst, as Countess Onslow chuckled.</p>
<p>“Call me Angela,” said another lady.</p>
<p>“My name is Leticia.”</p>
<p>“I am Christine.”</p>
<p>“Call me Sienna.”</p>
<p>They introduced themselves and chuckled, feeling at ease with each other. A delicious smell started emanating from the boiling pot. Amethyst added the spices and let it simmer for a while. The chicken soup was ready!</p>
<p>“Let’s serve this to the knights first,” said one of the ladies. “They helped us so much. They didn’t even sleep. They must be hungry, and tired.”</p>
<p>“Alright!” said Amethyst, “Angela, can you pass me the bowls?”</p>
<p>“Here you go,” said Angela.</p>
<p>It felt awkward to call each other so casually. But it was a pleasant kind of awkwardness that they were getting used to.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“How is the barrier?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“They are all in place,” said Gen. “We will arrive at the tent soon.”</p>
<p>“The preys have all gathered?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“The traps have been set around the perimeter,” said Gen, “They will gather around eventually, lured by the bait.”</p>
<p>Alexcent and Gen finally arrived and headed to the duke’s tent which had been set up. The knights of Count Onslow who had been sent to inspect the perimeter arrived outside the tent.</p>
<p>“We are here to report,” they said.</p>
<p>“Just in time,” said Gen, “It will probably be the report from the perimeters.” He invited the knights inside the tent.</p>
<p>The knights bowed to the duke. Alexcent acknowledged them with a nod. One of the knights, probably the leader, walked up to Gen and whispered into his ears. Gen nodded and the knights left in a hurry.</p>
<p>Gen looked pale. He stood there not being able to form the words to inform the duke about the new developments. <em>I guess this is what they mean when your mind goes blank.</em></p>
<p>Alexcent looked at Gen. “What is it?” he asked. He had never seen Gen so flustered.</p>
<p>“I…uh… it’s,” Gen stammered. <em>What should I do? I don’t want to die. </em>Gen tried to think of a way to break the news gently. He was scared. He should have gone out with the knights as well.</p>
<p>Alexcent glared at Gen impatiently. “Spit it out, will you?”</p>
<p>“Apparently, M-madam is here right now,” blurted Gen.</p>
<p>“What?!” thundered Alexcent.</p>
<p>Gen took a step back. He felt threatened by Alexcent’s angry glare. “My Lord,” he said, “Please calm down and think it through first! Madam hasn’t entered the barrier.”</p>
<p>“You think that makes a difference?” roared Alexcent.</p>
<p>“My Lord…”</p>
<p>“In the end, she…” he felt his fury flare. The vein on his forehead throbbed. He gritted his teeth. <em>Is that why she had smiled like that? </em>Alexcent seethed. <em>Amethyst! Why do you always go against me? If she was in front of me, I would just break her so she wouldn’t be able to think anymore.</em></p>
<p>He took a deep breath. “Where is she?” he asked, coldly.</p>
<p>“She is beyond the river,” said Gen, “She put up some tents…”</p>
<p>Alexcent strode out of the room and got on his horse. He took hold of the reins and galloped away, leaving Gen in the dust. Gen felt guilty even though none of it was his fault. He got on his own horse and followed Alexcent.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hearing the sound of galloping horses, Amethyst looked around. She saw a figure on the horse coming closer to their camping site. It was, undoubtedly, Alexcent. As he got closer and she could see him clearly, she was filled with worry as well as happiness.</p>
<p>Alexcent jumped off the horse hastily and walked towards her in long strides. Gen followed closely behind. Amethyst was scared. He looked furious. He looked like a knight in the battlefield ready to decapitate his enemy. She had never seen him this angry before.</p>
<p>The sight of him made her hold her breath. <em>This is bad, </em>she thought. She decided to speak first so she could calm him down before anything turned disastrous.</p>
