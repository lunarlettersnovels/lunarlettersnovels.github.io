            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 52</strong></p>
<p>These days, Alec seemed very busy which came as a relief to Amethyst.</p>
<p>She quickly left the mansion and went to the building where Roman and the others were.</p>
<p>“Good morning!”</p>
<p>“Madam! What brings you here so early in the morning?”</p>
<p>The maids were quite surprised to see their mistress here.</p>
<p>“Well… I couldn’t think of any other solution than this.” Amethyst declared somewhat resignedly.</p>
<p>“Any other solution—?”</p>
<p>“Is anyone not feeling well? Or does anyone want to take a day off today?”</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly asking such a thing?” One of the maids voiced everyone’s puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I’ll work on your behalf.”</p>
<p>“What?!” They cried in unison. Then one of them said, “What do you mean! Why would Madam—!”</p>
<p>“This is all to catch that bastar…no Dajal. This is a disguise of sorts, going undercover!”</p>
<p>The maids looked at her blankly so Amethyst explained calmly.</p>
<p>“Well, you know there is a saying… to catch a tiger you need to go into the tiger’s cave.”</p>
<p>“What?!” The room echoed with the chorus yet again.</p>
<p>“Haha, I guess you wouldn’t know. So basically I will reveal all of Dajal’s misdeeds myself.”</p>
<p>“Madam! That is too dangerous! What if something happened to you—”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Before that, I will oof! Beat the shit out of him first.”</p>
<p>“But…!”</p>
<p>“If it isn’t me then there is no justification to punish him. As you know he is a pro at making excuses. Even if I were to make all of you testify against him, he will find a way to escape. But with me as the ‘victim’, it’ll be different. Even though I may appear so, I am still a noble lady … so getting revenge might be hard but firing him should be doable. So, cooperate with me.”</p>
<p>The maids stared at her with mouths wide open. They had heard in passing from the maids in the mansion that the new lady of the house was peculiar but to think she was to this extent …</p>
<p>Roman stood rooted to the ground, and the only thought in her mind was <em>‘how do I stop this unstoppable lady.’ …</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, the younger maids were of a different opinion.</p>
<p>“I will lend you my clothes! We seem to have a similar figure so it should fit you perfectly.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, thank you!”</p>
<p>“No, right now that’s not important—”</p>
<p>“Roman, don’t worry. You should treat me comfortably… mm… Carol, yes call me Carol.”</p>
<p>“Carol….? Why Carol?”</p>
<p>“If you call me Amethyst then it will reveal my identity. So think of it as a false name.”</p>
<p><em>Carol…</em> Amethyst had no idea why that name came to mind. Most probably because it was the title of the last movie she had seen.</p>
<p>“Really must you go this far? What if you were to get hurt Madam….” Roman was like a cat on a hot tin roof.</p>
<p>“You know there is no other way.” Amethyst countered.</p>
<p>“But to go this far for us—”</p>
<p>“If I didn’t know about it then that’s one thing, but now that I know how could I possibly look past it? I have a duty to protect my people!”</p>
<p><em>My people …</em> It was the first time Roman had heard such a phrase from someone of noble standing.</p>
<p>She swallowed hard … if the mistress was willing to go all the way out for them … “Then… let me fill you in on what to be careful about. Don’t ever, ever, ever be alone with Dajal.”</p>
<p>“Ah….!”</p>
<p><em>So he must be doing those things when he’s alone with them. Sly scum!</em></p>
<p>Amethyst nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Today we need to clean the stables. It might be difficult.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I’m good at cleaning,” Amethyst said cheerily.</p>
<p>“How could a noble lady like you possibly be good with cleaning?”</p>
<p>“Ah! Back home … my father was very humble so I cleaned my own room… and a humble lifestyle made me—”</p>
<p>“I see. Understood. But if it gets difficult please take a rest in between.” An apprehensive Roman implored.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Amethyst nodded and changed into the maid uniform that Roman handed to her.</p>
<p>It felt like she had become an otaku… <em>no, no what did they call it? Yes, costume …? Cosplay?</em></p>
<p><em>A maid’s uniform! When else would she ever wear such a thing!</em></p>
<p>It was a black A-line dress that reached her ankles with a white ribbon-bound shirt collar that contrasted against the black backdrop, topping it off was a white apron. She indeed looked like a maid.</p>
<p>With Roman’s help, she tied up her long hair and hid it beneath a white bonnet. Thankfully, Amethyst was not an astonishing beauty. It was an ordinary face that could be easily forgotten. Somehow she seemed to suit the ragged maid uniform than the new dresses she put on every morning.</p>
<p>“I know it may sound rude… but… it suits you.” Roman seemed to have shared her thoughts.</p>
