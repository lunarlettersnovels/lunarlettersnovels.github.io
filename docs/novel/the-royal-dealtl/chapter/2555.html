            <p><strong>Chapter 113 – Provocation</strong></p>
<p>“Didn’t you already come by before to steal the flowers I ordered?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>The ladies present balked at the word ‘steal’ and started whispering among themselves. Perhaps they were whispering about Count Glacia. But Count Glacia seemed unfazed by it all.</p>
<p>“I did not steal them,” said Count Glacia, “I bought and paid for them. Your words might be misleading.”</p>
<p>“Misleading?” asked Amethyst, “Is that how we describe someone who reprimanded the florist to forcefully take my order for yourself?”</p>
<p><em>She really thinks it’s the first time I am dealing with people like her, </em>thought Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Oh no, you are mistaken,” said Count Glacia, “Please don’t hold a grudge.”</p>
<p>“I have no intention of holding a grudge,” said Amethyst, “I am just laying out the facts and I am not mistaken.”</p>
<p>“You really must be very angry,” said Count Glacia, “I didn’t intent to offend you, let me return the flowers.”</p>
<p>Amethyst thought that Count Glacia was trying to provoke her further so that she will be inclined to make a scene in front of everybody. She recalled a colleague of a similar attitude at the place she used to work at. A colleague from another department who always blamed Amethyst for every little fault of hers. She recalled how when she had pointed out a mistake in her work, her colleague had started crying accusing Amethyst of being rude. She had spoken loudly so everyone could hear her and sympathize with her while making a villain out of Amethyst in their eyes.</p>
<p>Amethyst’ workload had increased as the colleague had always dumped her own work on Amethyst saying if she had so much problem with her then perhaps, she should take care of the work since she was competent enough.</p>
<p>Amethyst had been furious. But she had apologized to the colleague, only to come home and regret that she hadn’t retorted in her own defense. Everybody in the office looked at her as though she was so petty that she picked a fight whenever. The bitter memory still stayed with her and Count Glacia was doing exactly like her colleague had done to make her look bad in front of the others when she hadn’t done anything at all to offend her in the first place.</p>
<p>“I don’t need it back,” said Amethyst, “As you can see, the tea party has already been decorated and we are in the middle of enjoying it. You can keep it as a gift from me. But again, you paid for it so it might not be a gift. Anyway, it’s alright.”</p>
<p>“Oh. It has already started,” said Alexcent entering the glass house. Amethyst hadn’t seen him for the whole day but here he was with a bouquet of baby’s breath in his hands. Amethyst knew she should have felt happy but in the light of what happened, she only felt a stab in her heart. <em>What is he trying to do?</em></p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“I heard you prepared a tea party,” said Alexcent, “I wanted to congratulate you.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Amethyst, “What’s that in your hand?”</p>
<p>“Your favorite flower,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>Amethyst had this great urge of snatching the flower and stomping on it. Instead, she took a deep breath and asked, “Did Count Glacia give the flower to you? Did she tell you that it was my favorite flower?”</p>
<p>“No—” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“No, Lady Skad!” interrupted Count Glacia. “You are mistaken.”</p>
<p><em>I can see the whole picture now. I’m sure she passed Alexcent my favorite flower and told him to give it to me at the tea party as a gift. She might have done it herself because if she had made a maid do it, they will have told me.</em></p>
<p><em>Seeing how she appeared at the tea party before Alec, she must have known that I would have caused a scene over the baby’s breath and wanted Alec to see my outrage himself. She must have realised that I wasn’t the kind to go down without a fight during the banquet. She would then make the most fake pitiful face and defend herself.</em></p>
<p><em>And if Alec had seen the situation..?</em></p>
<p><em>Should I call her meticulous or dumb.</em></p>
<p><em>Seeing how everything was playing out to be so obvious, does she really not expect me to know how this will play out like it does in the dramas?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst had no intention of humoring Count Glacia nor was she going to ruin this tea party that she had prepared so lovingly. She wasn’t going to rise up to her provocation.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Alec,” said Amethyst, “Thanks to Count Glacia too that I got to receive my favorite flower.” She accepted the flowers from Alexcent.</p>
<p>“You’re mistaken,” said Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“Still?” asked Amethyst, “Is it not true you snatched every last baby’s breath I wanted decorated?”</p>
<p>“If you are still angry about that, I apologize,” said Count Glacia, “I am very sorry, Lady Skad. Please forgive me.”</p>
<p><em>Now she apologizes and acts very innocent after denying it earlier that she took the flowers!</em> Ever since Alexcent joined them, Amethyst didn’t fail to notice how Count Glacia had addressed her as ‘Lady Skad’.</p>
<p>“Fine,” said Amethyst, “I accept your apology. And Alec, thank you for the gift but I would rather prefer to receive a gift chosen by you than by someone else’s influence. It would mean more to me that way.”</p>
<p>Far from Count Glacia had anticipated, the duchess remained calm and regal despite her hidden provocation.</p>
<p><em>I won’t let things go as you want. </em>Amethyst then walked to the door of the glass house and held it open for both of them. “Now, you two. Please get lost now. The heads of the families should be carrying out your duties and attending meetings. While we should be doing our duties too. Let’s not intrude and disturb each other. I am sure we all are busy, you with your meetings and us with our tea party!”</p>
