            <p><strong>Chapter 298</strong></p>
<p>Count Glacia seemed a bit more at peace. Was it because she had someone by her side now?</p>
<p>Amethyst smiled and greeted her. “I’m glad to see you again, Count Glacia. And…” As Amethyst looked at the man beside her, Count Glacia introduced him. “Ah, he’s my personal secretary. My aide wasn’t feeling well.”</p>
<p>The man said his greetings with a very innocent smile while not looking concerned how he was introduced.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to meet you milord and milady. I’m Lupes Bandid.”</p>
<p>It seemed a little suspicious how close he was standing with her as a personal secretary. Amethyst was trying to guess what their relationship was while welcoming the man.</p>
<p>“Mr. Lupes, nice to meet you. Thank you for coming. Please make yourself at home while you stay here.”</p>
<p>“I should be the one thanking you. And please just call me Lupes, milady.”</p>
<p>Alexcent wasn’t pleased with his words and interrupted their conversation. It seemed like he didn’t like Amethyst being nice to Lupes.</p>
<p>“Hey, Lu. Enough with the greetings.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Excuse me.”</p>
<p>Amethyst freaked out and glared at Alexcent. Lu?! It was like calling his pet dog! She changed the subject quickly. “You must be tired from traveling. Hopefully your stay will be comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your concern.”</p>
<p>“Of course. The duke’s mansion was always the best treating guests.”</p>
<p>“Enough!” Alexcent exploded in the end at endless greetings. Everyone bowed and flinched at sudden rage. Amethyst poked him on the side.</p>
<p>“Then enjoy your night and we’ll see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yes. We’ll see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Ah, we prepared your bedroom in the guest place like everyone else. Is that ok, Count Glacia?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As Amethyst and Alexcent entered the feast, everyone stood up. Everyone was sitting at the round table unlike before. The feast started, and Amethyst saw that the seat beside Count Glacia was empty. She was curious but didn’t show it during the feast.</p>
<p>The chatter went on, as they greeted each other and started talking about all kind of things. It was Count Onslow who left first. Amethyst, on the other hand, stayed until the end to brighten the feast.</p>
<p>The next day, Amethyst was discussing with Lunia on what to do for entertainment and asked what she was curious about last night at the feast.</p>
<p>“How is Lupes?”</p>
<p>Lunia thought for a bit and answered. “Well, Lupes seems quite popular. He’s apparently already quite popular amongst the mansion’s employees. His face is the type that brings out motherly instinct.”</p>
<p>“No, not like that. It seemed like he wasn’t feeling well from a long travel, so I was wondering if he was alright.”</p>
<p>“Lupes?”</p>
<p>“Mhm. Count Glacia attended the feast last night alone.”</p>
<p>Lunia was dumbfounded at her mistress’ insinuations. Sometimes she felt that the duchess really didn’t have knowledge especially on the social classes.</p>
<p>Well, that was also the Duchess’s charm. Her naivety.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it obvious?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Lupes is just a personal secretary of a count. He’s not a noble nor does he have an aide title so if he wasn’t invited, he can’t attend.”</p>
<p>“Ah I see.” Amethyst realized. It wasn’t even that Lupes wasn’t a noble, but also, he was just Count Glacia’s subject, so Lunia was correct on why he couldn’t attend these events unless invited. Or else it would be considered insubordination.</p>
<p><em>Darn, I didn’t think it through</em>.</p>
<p>“I should’ve been more considerate.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about it. That is something Lupes himself knows better than anyone.”</p>
<p>“Mm… Honestly, I don’t see Lupes as just a personal secretary to Count Glacia.” Amethyst made privy of her thoughts to her trusted friend.</p>
<p>Lunia nodded her head, “We share the same thought.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Amethyst smiled at Lunia who in turn, had a smile on her face, “I hope things go well between them.”</p>
<p>As Amethyst was being mindful about Count Glacia, Lunia also agreed. “Well, I too hope so, my lady, but a marriage between them might be a little hard to imagine.”</p>
<p>“Why?’</p>
<p>“Because Lupes is a commoner.” Amethyst listened intently at Lunia, “If there was no difference in social class then there will be no problem, but for a noble and a commoner to marry, they need a permission from a higher up.”</p>
<p>“Higher up?”</p>
<p>“Yes, only the Empress is a higher up to nobles. It’s not that easy.” Sometimes she forgot that the difference in social class in Sehar empire is taken so seriously. Only Amethyst was thinking it casually.</p>
<p>“Count Glacia was also a commoner before she married the predecessor count. So, they needed a permission from the Empress?”</p>
<p>“Of course. It was just easier as the duke helped her.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>If it wasn’t easy like Lunia said, then the current Count Glacia case would’ve been the first.</p>
<p>“I still want things to go well between him and Count Glacia.”</p>
<p>She remembered the way they were treating each other. Count Glacia looked more comfortable than before, and it was definitely because of his presence in her life.</p>
<p>Amethyst decided after thinking. “Lunia.”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“After the annual meeting, send Lupes an invitation to the ball. Don’t forget about him.”</p>
<p>“Yes, will do.”</p>
<p>“Now, we should probably do our job too right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I prepared like you’ve asked.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. But I’m worried. If the Duke will…”</p>
<p>“I told you not to worry about Alec.”</p>
<p>“Al-alright, my lady.”</p>
<p>Lunia still answered doubtfully.</p>
