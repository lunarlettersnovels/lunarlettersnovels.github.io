            <p><strong>Chapter 187</strong></p>
<p>After hearing from Roman that his wife had not yet returned to her room, Alexcent headed to the training grounds. Seeing how she wasn’t there he searched for her and when he did, he stood frozen.</p>
<p>Seeing her smiling, he turned his heavy footsteps around.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That night, Amethyst waited up for Alexcent and greeted him as he came back from his study.</p>
<p>“You aren’t asleep yet.”</p>
<p>“I was waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“Go to sleep.” He said dismissively but Amethyst wasn’t willing to let him go just yet.</p>
<p>As he headed towards the bed, she grabbed a hold of his arm. “Wait, are you very tired?”</p>
<p>“No.” His frown not betraying what he felt inside.</p>
<p>“Then come over here and take a seat.” Amethyst pointed towards the table.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Since we haven’t had the time to talk much lately. I know you’re busy but still…”</p>
<p>There were finger foods and wine laid out on the table. It was intentionally prepared for sure.</p>
<p><em>‘It’s you who don’t have the time to talk. Since you’re busy with Barden.’</em></p>
<p>Alexcent wasn’t up for it, but he went to the table as she wanted. “Gen says you’re busy preparing for the royal hunting competition….”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Has your arm healed?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. Glad it’s healing.”</p>
<p>Alexcent brought the glass to his lips. It wasn’t a bad wine but somehow the after taste was bitter. “Ah, try some of this. Don’t drink on an empty stomach.”</p>
<p>Amethyst picked a cookie from the plate and placed it in his mouth.</p>
<p>“How is it?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not too bad.”</p>
<p>“Really? Isn’t it tasty? Guess who made it?”</p>
<p>“Who made it?”</p>
<p>“Barden.”</p>
<p>“….”<br>
As Amethyst revealed who, Alexcent froze, unable to swallow nor spit out the cookie in his mouth.</p>
<p>“He bakes as a hobby. The more I look at him, the more I think he’s a good person.”</p>
<p>“He has a considerate side too…and seeing how he never misses out on a day of practice he also seems diligent.” Amethyst continued.</p>
<p>“I think he’s a good husband material. What do you think?” Amethyst asked with glistening eyes.</p>
<p>Alexcent scoffed at her words. <em>‘Ha, unbelievable. What do I think? She thinks I’m condoning it just because I’m remaining silent.’</em></p>
<p>Alexcent drank up all the wine in his glass, placed it on the table with a bang and spoke. “That’s enough!”</p>
<p>With those words he left her bedroom and left a startled Amethyst all alone to wonder what had happened.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day, Lunia asked her a question out of the blue.</p>
<p>“My lady, are you perhaps hiding anything from me?”</p>
<p>“Hiding?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so.” Amethyst thought hard after listening to Lunia’s question, but nothing came to mind.</p>
<p>“Alright then. Let me ask directly instead.” Lunia took a deep breath. “Why are you on such good terms with Barden?”</p>
<p>“Barden?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Mm, well…I wouldn’t say we’re on good terms but more like I’m helping him out?”</p>
<p>“Helping? With what?”</p>
<p>“Mmm…I can’t really say….”</p>
<p>“My lady!”</p>
<p><em>I guess it’s okay if Lunia knows right? Well, Barden didn’t say it’s a secret and tell me not to tell anybody. As long as I don’t mention the details.</em></p>
<p>“Fine…but only you should know.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Understood.”</p>
<p>Amethyst whispered the answer to Lunia. Of course, she didn’t mention who his one-sided love was.</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying, that you are helping him out with his unrequited love”</p>
<p>“Yes. Barden isn’t good with his words, so he seemed to have suffered quite a bit. Like on how to talk comfortably with women or talk to others without getting misunderstood. I’m teaching him a few stuff like that.”</p>
<p>After hearing Amethyst, Lunia was speechless and burst out laughing. It was far from what she had expected. After hearing from Roman that the prince had left the bedroom angrily, Lunia couldn’t understand why Madam was keeping Barden so close and had decided to ask.<em>‘What? Teach him how to talk to others without being misunderstood?! Really, what should I do with our dear lady…’</em></p>
<p>Lunia finally managed to talk. “I don’t think you’re in a place to help Barden.</p>
<p>“What? Why?”</p>
<p>“Well that’s because the duke”</p>
<p><em>‘No. Why should I meddle with this. Besides…it’s not every day you get to see the duke rage in jealousy.’ </em>Lunia, still holding a slight bit of a grudge from the previous incident, decided to prolong the situation a little longer and have her little revenge.</p>
<p>“Yes Lunia?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing my lady!”</p>
<p>“A-alright. Anyway, Lunia, make sure to keep it a secret!”</p>
<p>“Of course, my lady.”</p>
<p>But the thing about secrets, once they’re out, everyone is bound to know.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Several days had passed but ever since then, there was no chance of running into Alexcent. Amethyst felt his presence in the night but that was all.</p>
<p>By the time she opened her eyes, he was long gone. Because of that Amethyst was extremely unhappy and starting to feel annoyed.</p>
<p>“My lady.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“The head of the knights wishes me to relay a message.”</p>
<p>“Sir Hill?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he says after training today they will be eating what you like at the training grounds, and wonders if you would like to join them.”</p>
<p><em>What I like? Ah, intestines!</em></p>
<p>It was good news. She was craving for a good chew to relieve her stress.</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“Then I will relay the message.”</p>
<p>Amethyst got up from her seat and headed straight for the kitchen. She asked for the chef’s permission then prepared onions, garlic, potatoes, etc. Things that would be good to grill together and then headed to the training ground.</p>
<p>“Have you started already?”</p>
<p>“Not yet. We just got the fire going.”</p>
<p>“That’s a relief.”</p>
<p>Amethyst walked towards the corner of the grounds where the knights were huddled around.</p>
