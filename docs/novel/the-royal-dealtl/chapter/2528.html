            <p><strong>Chapter 140</strong></p>
<p>“Please,” begged Pon, “Please hear me out for once.”</p>
<p>“Since when do we need to seek your approval?” roared Countess Onslow, “I didn’t know the butler held such authority in the duke’s mansion!”</p>
<p>“Countess Onslow,” said one of the ladies, “This man seems to be undermining us.”</p>
<p>“No!” said Pon, “I don’t mean it like that. I would never…”</p>
<p>The skirmish continued. From Pon’s perspective, the possibility and fear of the duke’s wrath outweighed the anger of the ladies, so he was adamant on his stance.</p>
<p>“Then how dare you ignore Lady Skad’s orders?” bellowed one of the ladies.</p>
<p>“Yes. This is questioning her authority!” added another.</p>
<p>Before Amethyst could step in to diffuse the situation, the ladies had cornered Pon with accusations. <em>Poor Pon, </em>thought Amethyst. <em>Does this mean the ladies truly like me? I like them too, as a matter of fact. But Pon might cry if I let this continue. </em>She felt touched by their concern for her, but Amethyst decided to step in for Pon’s sake.</p>
<p>“Pon,” said Amethyst, “I know you are worried and understandably so. But I assure you, we are going camping in a safe place devoid of wild animals. I have prepared for it to be like that. We aren’t going deep into the mountains. Do you really think I wouldn’t have thought these things through? I would never put the ladies in danger.”</p>
<p>“Of course not, madam,” said Pon, “I am sure you have prepared everything meticulously, like you always do. But future is always uncertain. Nobody can know what might befall you.”</p>
<p>“As long as we are safe, there are no objections from your side, is that correct?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Madam, what do you—”</p>
<p>But Amethyst didn’t wait for him to finish. She turned to Roman. “Roman, I want you to get the commanders of the knights,” she instructed, “the 1st and the 2nd divisions. Please get them fast.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said Roman as she hastened to do as told.</p>
<p>Amethyst didn’t want to give in. If safety was the priority, the knights could provide that. <em>As long as we are safe, Pon can’t hold us back. If I can’t pull ranks in a situation like this, then what use is it?</em></p>
<p>The knights gathered at the entrance of the mansion as ordered and were puzzled to find the ladies gathered there as well.</p>
<p>They bowed respectfully as they face Amethyst. “Hilder Kourn, Commander of the Knights, at your service, madam.”</p>
<p>“Sir Hill,” said Amethyst, “I am sure you are aware that the duke is out on a hunting match.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said Sir Hill.</p>
<p>“Then I ask you,” said Amethyst, “In his absence, who has the authority in this mansion?”</p>
<p>Sir Hill genuinely looked perplexed now. He looked at Pon and sighed. Pon tried to gesture to Sir Hill but he didn’t quite understand what the butler wanted from him. “You, madam,” answered Sir Hill, “You hold the highest authority in the duke’s absence.”</p>
<p>Amethyst beamed at Sir Hill. “Very well,” she said, “As the lady of the House, I command you Sir Hill, Commander of the Knights, Sir Buer, Commander of the 1stdivision, Sir Leyrian and Sir Marcus, Chief of 2nd division, to accompany and ensure the safety of the ladies as we go camping.”</p>
<p>“What?!” exclaimed Sir Hill.</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?” asked Amethyst looking at him levelly.</p>
<p>“No, madam,” said Sir Hill, composing himself, “Did you say camping? Where, if I might ask, are you planning to set camp?”</p>
<p>“Just a bit further away from the mansion grounds,” said Amethyst, “I suppose we will be somewhat close to the hunting grounds.”</p>
<p><em>So, this was what Pon was trying to tell him, </em>thought Sir Hill, anxiously. <em>They want to go camping near the hunting grounds where the duke didn’t take even his knights. If the duke finds out…. </em>He didn’t want to think about the duke’s wrath, but he couldn’t disobey the Lady Skad’s orders. She was right, she was the highest authority present right now in the mansion.</p>
<p>“Understood, madam,” said Sir Hill ordering his knights to prepare for departure. The knights bowed respectfully. Pon covered his face with his hands and turned a slight shade of grey.</p>
<p>“Are you happy now, Pon?” asked Amethyst, “The knights will keep us safe.”</p>
<p>Pon had no other choice. If he resisted further, it would signify disobedience. He couldn’t cross the line and be accused of disloyalty. He simply prayed they would return before the duke.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said Pon, “Please take care of yourselves.”</p>
<p>The other ladies cheered for their little victory. They boarded their carriages that had been waiting before anyone else objected to their outing.</p>
<p>“Madam,” called Pon.</p>
<p>“Yes, Pon?” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Please make sure you are accompanied by the knights at all times,” said Pon.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Amethyst, “Don’t worry. Everything will be fine.”</p>
<p>Pon looked long and hard at Amethyst. She always had a knack for finding trouble. He sighed and surrendered.</p>
<p>“Once you reach near the hunting grounds,” said Pon, “You will find a barrier that was erected to prevent the wild animals from crossing over. Please never cross that barrier. Please promise me.”</p>
<p>“Barrier?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Pon, “You will know it when you see it. It is very apparent. Can’t miss it.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Do you promise?” asked Pon again. <em>They won’t run into the duke as long as they don’t cross that barrier, </em>though Pon, as a last resort. He wasn’t going to let her go until she promised.</p>
<p>Amethyst sighed. “Pon,” she said, “Do you know that sometimes you can be even more protective than Alec?”</p>
