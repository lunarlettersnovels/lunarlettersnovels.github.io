            <p><strong>Chapter 125</strong></p>
<p>Count Glacia did not really have that high of an expectation for a good answer from Amethyst. She was just doing this to put Amethyst in a spot. Besides, what would a pretty Lady of the Household know anything about politics anyway?</p>
<p>“Ah, no,” said Baron Piamon, “That’s alright. We shouldn’t worry Lady Skad with unnecessary discussion.” Seeing how the duke was very quiet, Baron Piamon came to Amethyst’s rescue and tried to wrap up the conversation. Amethyst, meanwhile, stared long and hard at the map, focusing on the problem at hand.</p>
<p>“If it was up to me,” she said, finally after a long silence, “I would dig through.”</p>
<p>If there were already trade in gems, that meant there was a mine and miners. It wouldn’t be like mining for gems, but the miners could be paid to dig through the wall to create a passage to be used by baron Piamon and his people. It would be difficult but in the long term, it wouldn’t be a bad investment.</p>
<p>“Dig through…,” said Baron Piamon, “what do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I would dig through the mountain,” she continued, “Of course, it needs a great deal of planning to dig through in a way that it doesn’t collapse the mountain from the inside but makes a hole big enough for the carriages to pass. Perhaps a tunnel to deliver the goods.”</p>
<p>“A tunnel?” said Baron Piamon, thinking to himself.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amethyst, “Regarding the situation right now where you don’t have an alternate route, a tunnel seems like the most logical solution, albeit a little difficult. It might require immense, time, cost and effort but when you look at it, it might prove very beneficial in the long term.”</p>
<p>“I see…” said Baron Piamon staring at the map in a newfound way. Count Renove seemed intrigued by the suggestion.</p>
<p>“As long as we manage to… cross the mountain one way or another,” said Count Renove, “It is all grass fields right up to the capital, owned by nobody. It would save us time as well since we might not have to take the longest route. The best thing would be that we wouldn’t need to cross through Count of Fendence’s estate! We could completely bypass it and make our own way!” Count Renove looked at Amethyst in admiration. “Lady Skad, you are amazing! As expected, of course.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t do anything at all,” said Amethyst, modestly, “I am glad I was able to assist in any way.”</p>
<p>“No, Lady Skad,” said Baron Piamon, “You are a genius! This was my biggest dilemma overshadowing the annual festival this year, and you solved the problem instantly! I should have consulted you sooner. Thank you so much for your expertise!” Baron Piamon’s eyes sparkled, and he looked at Amethyst with respect.</p>
<p>Count Glacia, meanwhile, didn’t share the happiness of others. She wore a sour expression. <em>Serves you right, </em>thought Amethyst smugly. She, however, wished Alexcent would say something.</p>
<p>Sitting opposite her, his elbow was draped on the armrest of the sofa, propping his chin on his fingers. His face looked impassive, as though none of this mattered to him.<em> I wonder how long he is going to be like that. Did I do something wrong? </em>Alexcent’s silence always made her doubt herself.</p>
<p>“If the duke grants the permission for this idea at the next meeting,” said Baron Piamon, looking cautiously at Alexcent, “We can get started right away.”</p>
<p>Every mountain in the empire belonged to the emperors. So, the mines also belonged to the emperor. Even if the land was unclaimed, nobody had the right to deforest it or use it in any other way before seeking permission from the emperor.</p>
<p>Alexcent stared long and hard at Amethyst. It was an awkward sort of moment. <em>Why? Why are you looking at me like that? Just say something… anything, </em>thought Amethyst. The moment was too overbearing, so she broke the gaze first and looked away.</p>
<p>Alexcent, still looking at her, gave a curt nod. Baron Piamon, satisfied that his conflict had been resolved, started filling the glasses with alcohol.</p>
<p>“Now that the problem has finally been resolved,” declared Baron Piamon, “Can we just take a glass each in celebration.”</p>
<p>“Now we can all properly taste the alcohol.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. I’m relieved I no longer have to hear Baron Piamon complain! My ears were starting to shrivel.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere started to lighten, and everybody was relaxed and getting friendly. Amethyst seized her opportunity. She felt sorry to baron Piamon for what she was about to do but he was the only one who seemed to be on her side, so she needed him. Besides, she had resolved his problem. He owed her. So, she apologized mentally to baron Piamon.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s this alcohol!” said baron Piamon, recognizing the taste from the night of the feast.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes!” said Amethyst, “It’s the one you released recently. I had it brought here.”</p>
<p>“So considerate of you, thank you so much!” said the baron, happily.</p>
<p>As baron Piamon raised the glass to his lips, Amethyst looked at the alcohol in longing. “Even though I can’t join you for a drink after… what happened,” she said, “I quite liked the taste.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see,” he said as he downed it.</p>
<p>“The scent was very sweet,” said Amethyst sadly, “I am rather sad I can’t have it again.”</p>
<p>Baron Piamon looked at her full of pity. “Well, maybe you can try a very small glass…,” he suggested.</p>
<p>“Really?” said Amethyst, brightening up, “Yes! Maybe I will! Just a little.”</p>
<p>“What?!” said Alexcent. He had been so quite that at his sudden voice, Baron Piamon flinched.</p>
