            <p><strong>Chapter 107 – It Is Not a Shame (2)</strong></p>
<p>There was no need for her to explain herself, but she wanted to. What the head of the household did in their own house was none of anyone’s business. She felt, despite herself, that the pointed question was taking a dig at her. She didn’t want to be looked down upon, just because she was handling these responsibilities for the first time.</p>
<p>“Ah, is that so?” asked Count Glacia, “I was simply concerned that it was such an unusual thing for a long-serving staff of the Skad family to be dismissed so suddenly. It is a shame.”</p>
<p>“Then perhaps I should be more transparent and tell you more about the matter so that you will be put at ease, Count Glacia,” conceded Amethyst. If they wanted to hear dirt at the dinner table, then so be it. “It is not unknown that Dajal was repeatedly violent towards his employees. That was the least of his criminal behaviors. He was found to be guilty of acts of embezzlement, bribery and sexual harassments. Some employees have also reported sexual assaults. Considering his crimes, actions needed to be taken. And as someone in a high position, it is our duty to protect those under our care. So, no Count Glacia, it is not a ‘shame’ to have fired him. He got what he deserved. Were you fond of him?”</p>
<p>Silence fell. It seemed as though a spark had been ignited. Beneath the veneer of politeness that the nobles put on, they could, most times, be the rudest and brutalist of people.</p>
<p>“Of course not,” said Count Glacia, with ever so much elegance, “I do apologize I was simply unaware of the details. I was simply concerned about the rumors which indicated that you wielded your power unfairly to fire long-serving staffs, which obviously isn’t true. I am sure rumors will disappear, but I am ever so grateful to you for clearing my misunderstanding.”</p>
<p><em>Rumors? </em>Amethyst recalled Pon saying that it was treason for a servant to speak about the affairs of their employers. Knowing Pon, she believed he would keep the staffs firmly secretive on the matters concerning the household. So, the staffs wouldn’t be spreading these rumors, obviously. Besides they had been tormented as much as any other servants under Dajal. Surely, Dajal being fired gave them more relief than anyone else. <em>Maybe she is lying, </em>thought Amethyst. <em>Maybe she wants me to make a slip so rumors could start from this table.</em></p>
<p>“It is interesting that these fruitless rumors ha reached from the Duke’s mansion in the capital to far suburbs, close to your estate…,” said Amethyst, “Unfortunately I am unaware of such rumors at this moment but I am glad that I was able to clarify.”</p>
<p>Count Glacia remained unfazed, an elegant smile in place and her eyes full of amusement. Just as she opened her mouth to speak, Baron Piamon beat her to it.</p>
<p>“How great to have cleared any misunderstandings,” he said, “We must have alcohol to celebrate! I brought a brandy that I recently invented with a new technique. It will be introduced in the market soon, but I have brought a bottle along as gift. Please enjoy!”</p>
<p>Piamon signaled to a servant, who ran along and came back with a decanter of the brandy. The servant poured a glass for everybody, beginning from Alexcent. Soon, in front of them, a glass with reddish liquid glittered on the table.</p>
<p>Amethyst looked down at her glass. <em>Alcohol! </em>She had always enjoyed her liquor. Before getting married, she had enjoyed it quite heartily. A drink with her friends, with colleagues and her boss, a can of beer when she was alone. Right now, in this den of uppity people, she could indeed do with some alcohol. She was curious what Count Glacia had been about to say but that could wait. This wasn’t all bad.</p>
<p>Amethyst already liked Baron Piamon for his observant nature. He had interrupted at the right time to provide her with something she needed the most right now.</p>
<p>She picked up and glass and raised it to her lips, when a strong hand grabbed her arm. “No,” Alexcent commanded.</p>
<p>The liquor slushed in her glass. “You almost made me spill it!” she said.</p>
<p>“Do you know how strong that liquor is?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“I guess we will find out soon, love,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“I am telling you, it’s very strong,” said Alexcent desperately. Not letting go of her arm.</p>
<p>“I am sure,” said Amethyst, “Besides refusing a gift is rude.”</p>
<p>“Ash…,” said Alexcent in a soft voice.</p>
<p><em>Don’t, </em>thought Amethyst. <em>Don’t call my name like that now after treating me like that the whole time. Don’t shake me up again. Don’t look at me like that.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst took the glass in her other hand because he wasn’t letting go. A vein throbbed on Alexcent’s forehead. Baron Piamon seemed to be having second thoughts about it.</p>
<p>“Lady Skad,” he said, “Unlike how it looks, it indeed is very strong.”</p>
<p>“I am sure, thank you,” said Amethyst raising the glass to her lips.</p>
<p>“It might just be too strong,” he insisted.</p>
<p>“That’s alright, Baron,” said Amethyst, “Hope it lives up to the flourish with which you have presented it. Can I drink now or is the liquor here only to be admired?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” he said, defeated.</p>
<p>Amethyst looked at Count Glacia, who was still smiling at her, and gulped down the liquor in one go. <em>I am sure it’s like hard liquor, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>it should do no harm. I didn’t fall behind anyone when it came to drinking in my day.</em></p>
