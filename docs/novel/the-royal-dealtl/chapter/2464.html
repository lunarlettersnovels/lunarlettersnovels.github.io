            <p><strong>Chapter 204</strong></p>
<p>“It’s been a while.” Celios politely greeted Alexcent as he entered.</p>
<p>Alexcent didn’t like the man before him, but he was of the bloodline of the Goddess.</p>
<p>“Life must be good for you,” Alexcent said, smugly.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Celios asked.</p>
<p>“Your face is bright.”</p>
<p>“It’s all due to working very hard for the Empire, and you.” Celios stated, arrogant as always.</p>
<p><em>That is a bunch of bullshit</em>, Alexcent thought. The two men glared at each other, trying to remain polite but looking like they were ready to kill each other.</p>
<p>“That has nothing to do with me. It’s thanks to Her Majesty the Empress.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s not wrong either.” Celios smirked, agreeing with Alexcent.</p>
<p>“So, is that why you took so much?”</p>
<p>“Pardon? I’m not sure I know what you’re talking about.” Celios acted confused. He already knew the moment Alec visited the temple. The reason why he was looking for him.</p>
<p>“Ha, trying to act clueless.” Alec could tell that Celios knew the reason he was looking for him. “Let’s not waste time, you know that we’re not on that kind of terms.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? But I really don’t know what you mean.” Celios refused to give up the charade</p>
<p>“Celios.” Alexcent’s voice took on a deep tone of warning.</p>
<p>“Are you referring to the Empress donating to the temple. Is that a problem?”</p>
<p>“You’re saying you don’t know the reason why the Empress donated that much to the temple?” Alexcent was getting furious. “Especially after you met her. I would think you would know, better then anyone else, what kind of a person I am?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty. You’re making it sound like I blackmailed the Empress into donating. That’s disgraceful. You know just as well that the Empress wouldn’t give in to blackmail.”</p>
<p>“Celios, I’m warning you. My patience is waning thin.” Alexcent said. <em>I should have killed this rat. I won’t take much more of this arrogant behaviour.</em></p>
<p>The two men glared at each other in silence.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know you better than anyone.” Celios finally broke the tense moment. “I’ve known you since you were a baby. But it appears to me that you’ve lost some of your common sense since your marriage. Shouldn’t you have gone to the Empress, rather than come to me?”</p>
<p>“What?” Alexcent didn’t know what he was getting at.</p>
<p>“You’ve came to the wrong place. It was the Empress who initiated the donation after meeting with me. Perhaps she felt it necessary and that should be something to speak to her about. What is your reason for coming to me?”</p>
<p>Alexcent frowned. He was confused at what was happening. <em>He certainly seems confident at the fact that Belice donated the money for a different reason. Belice, what did you do? What are you trying to hide?</em></p>
<p>Alexcent stood up. “Well, it appears that you’re not going to tell me what it is. If I find out that you’re playing me, I’ll be back.” Celios wasn’t stupid enough to show the hand that he was holding. He knew something that would ruin Belice and he intended to hold on to it. Perhaps, Alexcent would need to confront Belice after all. But scandals like this were dealt with firmly and with no mercy. Alexcent had just wanted to remind Celios of that. He turned and left the office.</p>
<p>The moment Alexcent was out of sight, Celios called in a priest.</p>
<p>“Find me someone who is good at finding missing people,” Celios instructed.</p>
<p>“Pardon? You mean a searcher?” the priest asked</p>
<p>“Yes. And find me the best.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p><em>If the Duke has found out, then it’s only a matter of time, </em>Celios thought<em>. He will try to destroy all the evidence, so I have to find it before he does. I’ll need to move fast.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Gen quickly joined Alexcent’s side as he left the High Priest’s office. “What did he say?” he asked.</p>
<p>“He kept changing the subject. I think we should go to the palace now,” Alexcent replied.</p>
<p>The document Alexcent had read in the carriage back to the capital was a report of an immense amount of money being transferred from the Empress’ personal vault to the temple, specifically Celios. Each time the High Priest Celios visited the Empress, there was a donation, and this led Alexcent to the temple. But now it seems the Empress was paying to keep Celios silent, rather than blackmailing him.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I have something to tell you before we go,” Gen interrupted Alec’s train of thought.</p>
<p>“Say it.”</p>
<p>“Madam has disappeared,” Gen reported, hesitantly.</p>
<p>“What?!” Alexcent stopped and glared at Gen.</p>
<p>“The night after you went to the town, she left the castle without anyone knowing. Should we search for her?”</p>
<p>Alexcent pressed on his temples as Gen was speaking. The voices started swirling in his head again. <em>Why now? Why are you so keen on leaving me? You wanted to leave me at all costs, you must have disliked me that much! Is that why you abandoned me?</em> This news was the worst timing and it seemed like everything in Alexcent’s life was falling apart. <em>Ash! I need you now! Why are you running from me?</em></p>
<p>Alexcent tried his best to calm his mind and answered, “Not right now. It’s more important that we see the Empress.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” Gen answered, concerned.</p>
<p>As they started walking again, Alexcent could not abandon the thought that everything and everyone he had ever known was disappearing.</p>
<p><em>Where did it go wrong? </em>He thought in despair.</p>
