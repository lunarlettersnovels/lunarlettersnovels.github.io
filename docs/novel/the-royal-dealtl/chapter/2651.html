            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 22 – A Wife’s Duty (2)</strong></p>
<p>Belice tilted her head as she observed the two and carried on the conversation. “Well, I suppose a new appearance can be appealing. By the way Duke Skad, I am thinking of promoting Count Lohikin to be the Minister of Finance, what do you think? After all he will be in-laws with the Royal family, so it makes me rather uneasy that he has no official title.”</p>
<p>“No, your majesty! If you promote him for such a reason it will do you no good in the future.” Amethyst spoke up in surprise.</p>
<p>Duke Skad looked at Amethyst as though he was surprised by her reply and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“I agree with the Lady on the point.”</p>
<p>“Hmm is that so. Amethyst, won’t you feel disappointed? It’ll probably be better if the Count is promoted to be the Minister of Finance.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, my father may be involved in political affairs, but he has always said that he has no interest in being a Minister of Finance. So please withdraw your offer.”</p>
<p><em>‘Of course, it would be great if her father became the Minister of Finance if she was the real Amethyst.’</em></p>
<p>If her father were to become the Minister of Finance then the attention would be on her as well, then there was a higher chance that her future plan set a year from now, may fail.</p>
<p>Amethyst knew too well how the personal details of all kinds of family members were disclosed at the hearing where ministers were appointed, and how not only direct family members but even relatives were exposed to people’s attention.</p>
<p>Of course, the Sehar Empire may not hold political hearings or anything, but it was better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>“Then I’m sure a deputy finance minister should be okay. From what I hear he seems to have many years of experience in the finance department. So let’s conclude as such. Duke Skad, you were right. I like your young lady.”</p>
<p>“Th-thank you, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Just as they were about to move on to a lighter topic of conversation, Karune came over to inform Empress Belice of her next appointment.</p>
<p>“Guess we need to call it a day for today. Amethyst, feel free to come by and visit the palace. I have no sisters so I will be happy to have you visit. Duke Skad, you may leave for today.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty. I shall not keep you any longer.”</p>
<p>As Belice got up to leave, Amethyst and Duke Skad too got up to bid the empress farewell. Fortunately, Belice didn’t seem to suspect them and accepted their newfound relationship.</p>
<p>Amethyst, then, gestured to the duke and stopped him in his tracks. Duke Skad tilted his head questioningly and bent over to lean his face near to Amethyst, as she whispered softly.</p>
<p>Amethyst must have sensed that Belice’s attention was focused on her, as she deliberately whispered to his ears shyly with a smile, as though making a confession. The duke seemed surprised at first but must have come to a realization as he mumbled ‘No wonder she knew immediately whenever I pulled a prank on her when we were young.’ and glanced in Belice’s direction.</p>
<p>And before she knew it, the duke’s hands were wrapped around her waist. Belice pretended to not notice their public display of affection and walked on to her office.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At the duke’s mansion, rather than being educated on becoming the wife of the duke, Amethyst was busy preparing for the wedding. The duke had left all the preparation to her as she had said she wanted a grand wedding. In truth, it was more like pushing it towards her. As such, the second secretary of the duke, Lunia presented to assist Amethyst with the preparation.</p>
<p>“Lunia, so the duke has gone to the palace today as well?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is correct.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I need to choose the dress and there are many things to do. Please wake me up before Duke Skad enters the palace tomorrow. I will take him by the collar if I need to and drag him to go and choose the dress with me.” Amethyst emphasised her words.</p>
<p>Lunia flinched as the bride used the words “collar and drag.” She was amazed by her, who was treating the duke referred to as the ‘Prince of blood’ so casually. He must truly love her.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Thanks to Lunia, Amethyst was able to get up early in the morning which she used to find difficult. She couldn’t complain as she found the opportunity to catch hold of the duke.</p>
<p>Amethyst stopped the duke who was in the midst of preparing to enter the palace.</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Today we need to go and choose the wedding dress. So, I won’t allow you to go to the palace.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry but I don’t need to wear a dress.” He answered her cooly.</p>
<p>“Who said that I asked Your Highness to wear it?” The duke refused to acknowledge her, sp she called his attention once more. “Alec.”</p>
<p>“What? Are you really that dumb?”</p>
<p>“Jer-!”</p>
<p><em>‘Jerk!’</em> Amethyst forced her mouth to a close. She had to hold back for now. “Fine, Alec. Today I need to choose a dress, and I need you there as I choose. So, you can’t go to the palace today.”</p>
<p>“Why do I have to be there?”</p>
<p>“Because that’s the duty of the groom.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the duty of the groom! Are you willing to fulfil your duty as the bride?”</p>
<p>Amethyst hesitated at his clever gaze.</p>
<p>“Wh…what duty?”</p>
<p>“You’ll find out shortly. Fine, let’s go and see your dress. Gen, get ready to leave!”</p>
<p>Alexcent turned his head to order Gen, but somehow his assistant seemed more uncomfortable than he did.</p>
<p>“But Your Highness…today we have an important meeting regarding the Boron nation’s sea territorial dispute.O-Ok-kay.”</p>
<p>As Alexcent gave him a frosty glare, Gen agreed reluctantly and disappeared in a hurry to adjust his schedule.</p>
<p>These days whenever Alexcent and Amethyst met each other, they would bicker incessantly and growl at each other as if they wanted to bite off each other’s heads.</p>
<p>Gen worried and wondered if they would be able to get through the contract smoothly, but at times he also found himself confused by the constant laughter of the duke.</p>
