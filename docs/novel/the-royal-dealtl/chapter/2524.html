            <p><strong>Chapter 144</strong></p>
<p>“Al-Alec! What brings you here?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“What brings me here?!” shot back him, furiously.</p>
<p>“Yes…” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>Alexcent laughed without mirth. He looked around at the knights, the noble ladies, Lunia and Roman. All of them cowered at the periphery avoiding his eyes. The situation looked dangerous.</p>
<p>“Go back right now,” he commanded, “All of you.”</p>
<p>Amethyst hadn’t expected to be welcomed with open arms, but she had thought she wouldn’t run into him so soon. She wasn’t even planning on entering the hunting grounds. She had just wanted to wait for him till the hunting match was over.</p>
<p><em>No, </em>said a voice in her mind. <em>I wanted to… coincidentally run into him. I was vying for luck to make us meet. </em>Some part of her wanted him to come looking for her. Like now. She wanted to be the one by his side instead of Count Glacia. But he wanted her to go back!</p>
<p>“N-No!” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“What?” said Alexcent, his voice dangerously low.</p>
<p><em>Don’t back out now, </em>resolved Amethyst. <em>This is my right.</em></p>
<p>“This is simply one of the events of the annual festival, and has nothing to do with the hunting match,” said Amethyst, “This is purely to build on our friendship!”</p>
<p>“So?” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“So, you have no right to tell me what to do,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“You ignore everything I say,” said Alexcent, threateningly, “You speak of rights while you cross every line? I will say this one more time. Go back with your group before I get even more furious.”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency,” said one of the ladies, coming to Amethyst’s defense, “It isn’t that dangerous. We intent to stay away from the barrier.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said another, “We will obediently stay away. So please…”</p>
<p>Alexcent directed them an angry glare. “Since when have the extended households become so rude?” said Alexcent, “How dare you go against me?”</p>
<p>The noble ladies visibly shrunk before his rage. “We apologize,” they muttered.</p>
<p>“Then go back,” said Alexcent, “All of you.”</p>
<p>The ladies walked towards their carriages. This trip was a socializing effort between the families. Besides Alexcent would never harm his own family, extended or not. But his command was absolute. No one dared go against it.</p>
<p>Seeing the ladies walk back to their carriages with slumped shoulders ignited a fury in Amethyst. She had planned this whole trip solely because of him but after she had spent time with the other ladies, everything wasn’t about him. She had liked spending time with the ladies, and she had begun to love this camping trip. Her camping trip. She didn’t want to go back.</p>
<p>She couldn’t understand why Alexcent barred her from coming anywhere near the hunting match while Count Glacia was allowed in the match. Even now he was opposing her so strictly. He was so rude to the ladies and he dared humiliate her in front of everyone. Why did he have to win every time? Why was it that any thing she did was always met with his disapproval?</p>
<p>“I-I said n-no!” said Amethyst, her fists clenched by her side.</p>
<p><em>Why the hell do I have to stutter? </em>Amethyst reprimanded herself, inwardly. But it was understandable that she was scared. Alexcent gave off a very threatening and dangerous aura. It was perilous to go against him while he was furious.</p>
<p>“Amethyst!” exclaimed Alexcent.</p>
<p><em>Did he just shout out my full name? </em>Amethyst stared at him in disbelief. She had always been ‘Ash’ for him. He had only ever used her full name on the first day they met. She trembled. She felt tears spring into her eyes. He tried to hold back her tears. <em>I can’t cry… not now. </em>She clenched her jaw and gritted her teeth. She wasn’t going to lose.</p>
<p>“Go back to the mansion immediately,” said Alexcent, his tone icy.</p>
<p>“I said I don’t want to go back,” said Amethyst, her voice cracking. “I am not going back. This was supposed to be our camping trip until you ruined everything.”</p>
<p>She knew that the trip was ruined already but she continued to resist. She didn’t want to always be afraid of him and cower in a corner. She wanted to stand her ground.</p>
<p>“Lunia!” yelled Alexcent, while he continued to glare at Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lord,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“You are fired,” he said.</p>
<p>“Alec!” exclaimed Amethyst as she grabbed his arm. “Don’t! Don’t do this. It’s not her fault, so why are you punishing her?”</p>
<p>“Not trying to stop someone they serve from bad decisions is in itself a mistake,” said Alexcent as response.</p>
<p>“Alec!” she cried, but he only glared at her.</p>
<p>“Get out of my sight this instant,” he said to Lunia, still glaring at Amethyst.</p>
<p>Amethyst tugged at his arms. “Please,” she said, “You don’t have to do this.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright, Madam,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“Lunia!” said Amethyst, sobbing now, “Please don’t go.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry,” said Lunia, “I am thankful to you for everything. Please take care of yourself.” Lunia bowed to her and the duke, respectfully and turned and walked away.</p>
<p>Gen rubbed the bridge of his nose. <em>Oh, Lunia, </em>he thought, <em>so, in the end you caused trouble for yourself. </em>He was sad to see her go.</p>
<p>Amethyst glared at Alec tearfully. Hatred filled her eyes. Tears ran down her cheek. She wasn;t trying to hold them in any longer. Alexcent met her glare heartlessly.</p>
<p>Alexcent looked at Sir Hill. Sir Hill, in turn, nodded respectfully. “Sir Hill,” said Alexcent, “You are—”</p>
<p>“I will go!” cried Amethyst, “I will go. Just don’t do this anymore. Please.”</p>
<p>Alexcent looked back at her, trying to meet her gaze but Amethyst looked away. She had nothing but hatred to offer him. “When you dare to go against me, you should expect the consequences of your actions,” he said.</p>
<p>Amethyst didn’t respond. She seethed in anger and hatred. Alexcent sighed.</p>
<p>“Gen,” he called, “Please escort Amethyst and the other ladies back to the mansion.”</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lord,” said Gen.</p>
<p>“Pack up,” said Alexcent to the knights.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” said Gen gently to Amethyst and escorted her to her carriage. Hill and the other knights began dismantling and packing up the tents.</p>
