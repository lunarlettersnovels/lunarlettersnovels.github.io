            <p><strong>Chapter 138</strong></p>
<p>“Please, madam,” sobbed Habe.</p>
<p>Amethyst sighed. “What you did cannot be overlooked, Habe,” she said, “This is not a simple mistake that I can brush off. It is betrayal towards me and the mansion. I cannot allow someone like that to remain here. I am sorry.”</p>
<p>“I am so sorry, madam,” said Habe, “But I will never…:</p>
<p>“Habe,” interrupted Amethyst, “A tremendous amount of energy and effort is required to build trust. And similar effort id required to maintain that trust. However, it doesn’t take even a second to destroy that trust. You should remember that wherever you go. There will be no employer who will tolerate being betrayed.”</p>
<p>“Madam…,” cried Habe</p>
<p>“You may leave,” said Amethyst dismissing her.</p>
<p>Habe kept kneeling on the floor, sobbing. Amethyst gestured to Roman, who helped Habe off the floor and escorted her out of the room.</p>
<p>“I… was a little surprised, madam,” said Lunia, when only two of them remained in the room.</p>
<p>“What about?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think you would go as far as to dismiss her immediately,” said Lunia, cautiously.</p>
<p>“It is for her own sake,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“For her own sake?” asked Lunia, confused.</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded. Lunia was further puzzled. She felt that if it was for Habe’s sake, Amethyst could have given her a pay cut but allowed her to keep her job. Lunia knew for a fact that nowhere else did the noble treat their employees as kindly as here in the mansion. She found Amethyst response a tad bit odd.</p>
<p>Lunia looked at Amethyst in confusion. “What do you think Alec would have done if he found out about this?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>It dawned on Lunia what Amethyst meant when she said it was for Habe’s sake. “He would definitely execute…”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amethyst, “If he found out about this kind of betrayal and negligence in the mansion, he would definitely have her killed in anger. Count Glacia might not suffer as much as Habe. She is only a maid whereas the other one is a count.”</p>
<p>The duke was very adamant and strict when it came to people who betrayed him. He never tolerated traitors. Habe had sold personal information about Lady Skad, at that. There was no way the duke would tolerate something like that and Amethyst knew this very well. Nobody could stop Alec from killing someone in anger.</p>
<p>“Make sure this incident remains a secret,” said Amethyst, “It should never reach Alec’s ears.”</p>
<p>“Understood,” said Lunia, “I will try to keep others from gossiping about it, but it might not be possible for long.”</p>
<p>“Just make sure this isn’t talked about for at least three months,” said Amethyst, “So that Habe gets to leave safely.”</p>
<p>“Understood,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>Amethyst still worried that if it reached Alec’s ears even after Habe was gone from the mansion, he would still try to punish her. Or maybe not. Since she wouldn’t be his employee any longer. The only choice Amethyst could provide was for Habe to find a job and leave before things got disastrous.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Madam, I hear that the hunting match preparations are almost coming to an end,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“Yes, that seems to be the case,” said Amethyst absentmindedly.</p>
<p><em>Why should I even care anyway? </em>Amethyst seethed. <em>It’s not like I will get to go to the match.</em></p>
<p>“Madam, you should begin planning on things to keep the ladies occupied once the hunting match begins,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“We could just do more tea parties,” said Amethyst, very dully. “Or we could drink and pass out.”</p>
<p>Lunia sighed as she watched Amethyst, who was splayed out on the sofa, disheartened. It seemed that she had lost her motivation to do anything at all.</p>
<p>“Madam, the hunting competition will last, at the least, for ten days,” said Lunia, “Do you plan on drinking tea every day for ten days? You will only receive complaints. The relationship that you worked so hard to build with the other ladies might be—”</p>
<p>“What?!” exclaimed Amethyst, interrupting Lunia.</p>
<p>“Sorry?” said Lunia, confused.</p>
<p>“You said the hunting match lasts for ten days,” said Amethyst sitting up.</p>
<p>“Well, yes,” said Lunia, “Usually that is how long they last. But this time the meeting ended earlier than expected so it might be possible that the hunting match might go on longer.”</p>
<p>Amethyst had thought the hunting match lasted just one day. She sat up straighter, the gears in her mind working again. “Ten days…,” said Amethyst, “So, Alec won’t be returning to the mansion for ten whole days? Or will he come and go?”</p>
<p>“They will put up tents on the grounds,” said Lunia, “The duke and the nobles would not be visiting the mansion for the duration of the match.”</p>
<p>“Hmm,” mumbled Amethyst. <em>Then he will be alone with Count Glacia for ten whole days! </em>Amethyst thought. <em>It’s won’t be just the two of them, of course but still…. And yet, he won’t let me attend the hunting match. Do they have something going on between them?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst only wanted to test her swordplay at the hunting match. She wanted to see how much she had learned, and the hunting match had been the perfect opportunity. And Alexcent refusing her every attempt didn’t make things easier. She was the type of person who got more curious when she was told to not to something.</p>
<p><em>Besides he wasn’t even going to come back until the end of the hunting match. </em>It was a situation similar to letting your husband go to overseas business trip with other female staff. The wife had to be understanding because it was work and other staffs were present but if that staff was Count Glacia…</p>
<p><em>This won’t do at all, </em>thought Amethyst. <em>But Alexcent won’t let me near the hunting grounds. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>“Lunia,” she called, “This is a matter that needs to be handled with highest form of confidentiality. Please inform the other ladies yourself.”</p>
<p>“Understood,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>Amethyst whispered the instruction into Lunia’s ears. Lunia’s eyes widened in disbelief. She felt that her madam was a very terrifying person.</p>
