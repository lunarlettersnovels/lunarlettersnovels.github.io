            <p><strong>Chapter 235</strong></p>
<p>The girl nodded, sniffling. She seemed a bit more comforted now that she was with Amethyst. Amethyst left the girl at the table with a glass of cherry juice and hurried upstairs. She quickly dressed, took some slippers from within the closet, went into the bathroom and soaked a towel in warm water, then headed back downstairs</p>
<p>She also washed the dirt off of Erina’s feet, being gentle with the scratches and cuts she had received from stones on the road and gave her slippers to wear. They were too big for her tiny feet, but at least they would give her protection from any more injuries.</p>
<p>“I’m just going to get some medicine from the kitchen, then we’ll head back,” Amethyst informed the girl. Erina sobbed and nodded.</p>
<p>Quickly, Amethyst headed to the kitchen and gathered a wide variety of herbs and plants that had healing properties. She made sure to have ingredients to reduce fevers, pain, and something to settle digestive issues. Packing everything in a bag, she returned to Erina.</p>
<p>“I’m ready to go, Erina.” Amethyst took hold of the girl’s hand and they stepped out of the shop into the morning. As they headed up the street, Erina kept stumbling from the large slippers. Amethyst crouched down.</p>
<p>“Erina, hop on,” she said.</p>
<p>“What?” Erina was confused until Amethyst motioned to her back. “Hurry. We shouldn’t keep your mother waiting any longer.”</p>
<p>Erina put her arms around Amethyst’s neck, as Amethyst hooked the girl’s legs, lifting her into the air.</p>
<p>“I can follow the route that you guide me to. You can do that right?” Amethyst asked over her shoulder</p>
<p>“Yes,” Erina answered and they headed off to Pauline’s house.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This was the first time that Amethyst had been to Pauline’s house, but she didn’t have time to admire the cleanliness of the décor with Erina dragging her to Pauline’s bedroom</p>
<p>“Pauline?” The woman was shivering and sweating at the same time and moaning in delirium. “Pauline, are you all right? Can you hear me?” She put a hand on Pauline’s forehead. It was burning hot, as she expected. She needed to get some medicine in her right away.</p>
<p>“Pauline! Pauline, wake up! You need to take some medicine!” Amethyst shook Pauline, but the woman did not respond. “Erina, can you please get me a glass of water?”</p>
<p>“Alright!” Erina nodded and ran to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Amethyst put a second pillow behind Pauline’s head to raise her up, so she wouldn’t choke on the medicine. She crushed some herbs into the glass of water that Erina brought her. Even though Pauline was unaware of what was happening, she eagerly drank the water that was placed to her lips. Amethyst was relieved. Hopefully the fever will go down and then she can figure out what other medicine Pauline required.</p>
<p>“Erina, where’s the bathroom?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“There.” Erina pointed to a doorway on the other side of the room.</p>
<p>Amethyst went into the bathroom and filled a bucket of water. Setting it near the bed, she then headed to the kitchen to heat a second pot of water. When it was boiling, she took the heated water and mixed it with the bucket to get a reasonable temperature.</p>
<p>“Erina, don’t worry. She should be better soon.” Amethyst’s words seemed to calm the child. She could only imagine how scared Erina was right now. Pauline was the only guardian she had, with her father being away for work.</p>
<p>Erina watched as Amethyst dipped a towel into the water and used it to wipe the sweat from Pauline’s body. It was the most she could do until the fever broke.  Pauline’s breathing eventually calmed and Amethyst relaxed a little. She placed a cool, damp towel over her brow then she and Erina went to the kitchen to prepare something to eat. Erina needed breakfast and her mother should eat something before taking any more medicine.</p>
<p>Amethyst was impressed at how clean and tidy the kitchen was. Pauline seemed like an ideal mother and it made Amethyst slightly embarrassed when she thought about herself in the past. Amethyst prepared some broth that Pauline would be able to eat easily when she awakes, as well as some eggs for Erina.</p>
<p>“Erina, come have some breakfast.” Amethyst called when everything was ready.</p>
<p>“I’m not hungry,” Erina said from her mom’s bedside.</p>
<p>“I know you’re worried about your mother, but I think she would be upset if she heard that you didn’t eat.”</p>
<p>Erina came out of the bedroom hesitantly and took a seat at the table to eat the eggs. Once Amethyst was satisfied that the girl was eating, she went to look on Pauline.</p>
<p>Amethyst sat next to Pauline. The woman moaned slightly, and her eyes fluttered open.</p>
<p>“Pauline,” Amethyst said softly. Pauline’s slowly opened. “I need you to sit up and eat something. We need to get some food in your system to help the medicine work.”</p>
<p>“Carol?” Pauline croaked.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me. Are you feeling any better?”</p>
<p>Pauline sat up slowly and looked around. She felt the towel on her head and looked to Amethyst, who sat worried next to her.</p>
<p>“How did you know to come?” Pauline asked.</p>
<p>“Erina came for me,” Amethyst answered.</p>
<p>“Erina? Where is she now?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Erina is eating breakfast. I gave you some medicine to help lower your fever, but you’ll need to eat some food. I’ve made some broth which I’ll bring to you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Pauline gave her a weak smile, her eyes tearing up slightly.</p>
<p>“Where is the pain? Does your throat hurt? Do you have a cough? How is your nose?” Amethyst went through all of the symptoms she could think of.</p>
<p>“No, it’s just my body aching all over. I think I’ll be all right.”</p>
<p>“Then I know what medicine should be best.” Amethyst removed some additional ingredients from her bag.</p>
<p>“You would make a great a mom,” Pauline said.</p>
<p>“Me?” Amethyst left the room embarrassed and got a bowl of the broth which she brought back to Pauline. “Eat all of this. I’ll go check on Erina.”</p>
<p>Erina, who was eating the breakfast Amethyst prepared her, put her spoon down and asked, “What about mommy?”</p>
<p>“She’s ok. Don’t worry and eat.”</p>
<p>“Ok.” As Erina finished her breakfast, Pauline came out of the bedroom.</p>
<p>“Mommy!” Erina jumped up and ran to Pauline, giving her a big hug.</p>
<p>“Pauline! Why are you out!” Amethyst went to help Pauline as she stumbled. She was still too sick to be wandering about.</p>
