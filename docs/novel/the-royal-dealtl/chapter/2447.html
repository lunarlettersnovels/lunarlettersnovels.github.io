            <p><strong>Chapter 221</strong></p>
<p>“Thankfully, she wasn’t hurt,” Gen assured him. “I made sure she was taken care of so that she could travel to somewhere far off and settle into a new life.”</p>
<p>“Search the area and kill any other chasers or those who have been working with them. Make sure to do it quietly, but do not leave a single person who could harm her alive,” Alexcent ordered.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.” Gen would make sure he handled it personally and would not chance giving the command to someone else. Alexcent was determined to eradicate any evidence that could lead back to him or Belice. Gen whistled into the darkness and a dozen shadows, the men they could trust who came with them, followed him into the night.</p>
<p>Alexcent took a deep breath, preparing himself for the next steps, then got on his horse and rode to his target.</p>
<p>Gen and his band of killers made quick work of the chasers that were in the area. As they completed the burial of the bodies, a thought occurred to him. <em>He isn’t…? How did I not see his intentions?</em></p>
<p>“I have to go after the duke,” Gen told the men around him. “Finish burying the evidence. Make sure you leave no trace. Then return to the castle.”</p>
<p>The men assured him everything would be completed fully. Gen quickly mounted his horse and went after the Duke. He hoped that he wasn’t too late.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Alexcent reigned in his horse in front of the Grand Temple. Tying his steed to a tree, he drew his sword and entered the concourse of the temple proper. The priests within looked up in surprise at the intrusion. The closest priest gaped at the sight of a drawn weapon.</p>
<p>“Duke Skad!” he shouted in anger. “You are in a holy space. You can’t bring a weapon in here!”</p>
<p>“Silence,” Alexcent growled. “Fetch me Celios.”</p>
<p>“What are your intentions with the High Priest?” the man enquired.</p>
<p>“That is none of your business.” Alexcent glared at the man.</p>
<p>“None of our business! Even if you’re royal blood, your orders mean nothing here. This temple bows only to the Goddess!” The priest was not threatened at all by Alexcent’s demands.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then I’ll find him myself.” Alexcent moved to enter the inner chambers of the temple. He pushed aside the priests who tried to block him, strode down a corridor, and entered the prayer hall. It was empty. Another door led from the chamber to the offices and living quarters. As Alexcent was about to pass through, the door opened from the inside and Cameron stepped through.</p>
<p>“Duke Skad! Stop!” Cameron shouted.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Alexcent asked.</p>
<p>“I’m the deputy priest. Why are you acting like this, entering the temple as if it was a battle field?”</p>
<p>“I don’t need you, deputy priest. Bring me Celios!”</p>
<p>“What do you want with the Grand Priest?” Cameron demanded of him.</p>
<p>“I will give you one guess.” Alexcent held up the sword he was holding. The tip glinted red from the blood of the last man he had killed.</p>
<p>“Tell me what the high priest has done,” Cameron said, trying to calm the situation.</p>
<p>“Or I could just kill you all, one by one, until you bring me Celios,” Alexcent threatened. “It would be pretty convenient. You would not have to move the bodies very far for the ritual of submitting them to become God’s Guardians.”</p>
<p>“Sir!” Cameron’s face bleached of all colour.</p>
<p>“Go find him. You must know where he’s hiding. Now!”</p>
<p>Cameron could not see any other option. “Come with me. I’ll show you to his chamber.”</p>
<p>“If you try to help him escape, I will burn this temple to the ground,” Alexcent warned the priest.</p>
<p>Cameon paused at that statement. “You can’t,” he pleaded. ”The Goddess Frosty sleeps here in the World Tree.”</p>
<p>“I’m very precise. I would never do anything to harm the World Tree.” Fire glared in Alexcent’s eyes. Cameron could tell that he was serious about destroying everything but the World Tree.</p>
<p>Alexcent followed Cameron down several halls to the living quarters. They stopped at a door on which Cameron knocked. “Celios! It’s Cameron.” His voice wavered with nervousness. From inside, there was only silence.</p>
<p>“I’ll let us in.” Cameron found a key on a ring at his belt and unlocked the door. The chamber inside was vacant. “Celios,” Cameron called.</p>
<p>“It figures he has a secret passage.” Cameron turned at the sound of Alexcent’s voice to see the huge painting of the World Tree opened outwards. Behind was a stone passage leading into darkness. “Where does it lead?”</p>
<p>“Under the outer wall of the temple,” Cameron admitted.</p>
<p>“Here is your High Priest. A man who leaves his fellow priests in danger and runs away. Think on that.” Alexcent patted Cameron’s shoulder, then headed to the chamber window. Opening it, he lept to the ground outside.</p>
<p>Cameron ran to the window, but saw no sign of the duke, as if he had vanished in thin air. He had no idea what was going on, but felt it best to return to the concourse to assure the other priests that everything was all right. The other priests had once again huddled against a wall, as the duke had made his way to the front entrance and was once again blocking their exit. <em>I thought he was after Celios, </em>Cameron thought. <em>Why is he back here?</em></p>
<p>Cameron didn’t hide his confusion and approached him. Either way, he thought it would be best to lead the duke out.</p>
<p>“My Lord. As you clearly saw, Celios isn’t in the Grand Temple. Please stop threatening us and leave.” Cameron demanded.</p>
<p>“Are you sure that you had no help with Celios’ escape?” Alexcent asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything about this. Please!”</p>
<p>“There was no way that I would be tricked by such a simple ruse,” Alexcent assured him.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean?” Cameron said, confused.</p>
