            <p><strong>Chapter 200</strong></p>
<p>Later that evening, Alexcent called Gen into his office, as the assistant was getting ready to leave.</p>
<p>“Gen, give Amethyst ten years’ worth of revenue and operation fees and the Hazen castle in Mir city, as well as the Louvelle castle in Der city.”</p>
<p>“Your highness! Why….” Gen could not believe what he was hearing.</p>
<p>“She’s leaving tomorrow. So please have it done before you leave.” Alexcent spoke the words as if this was simply business.</p>
<p>“Pardon?! Why is ma’am… there’s still time, aren’t you going to stop her?” Gen could not believe this was happening.</p>
<p>Alexcent, staring ahead with no light in his eyes, whispered quietly. “I don’t want her to feel burdened. Yes, those holdings should be enough from me. Also, we leave for the palace immediately.”</p>
<p>“As you wish,” Gen shut his eyes and answered. He couldn’t see any expression in Alexcent’s face. All he could see was a reawakening of the old ‘Duke of Blood” he hadn’t seen since the war. There were not going to be good times ahead.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It felt like a storm was approaching. Belice couldn’t sleep well since she had returned from the Duke, tossing and turning in her bed. She turned once more to see a dark shadow enter the room. The guards would never let anyone in at this hour. Her heart stopped with fear</p>
<p>“Belice.” Alexcent emerged from the shadows, a man who appeared in extreme pain. He collapsed at the side of her bed, crying. Belice immediately rose to sit next to him.</p>
<p>“Alexcent! What are you doing here at this hour? What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“She left. Belice! Oh, Belice!” Alexcent was wailing like a madman.</p>
<p>“Left? What do you mean?!”</p>
<p>“My heart feels like it’s going to burst. I wish it would burst, right now, and end everything. If I can put her out of my head, stop thinking about her, that would be best. But I can’t. I want her to come back. I’ll just have to wait. Belice, I’m going to wait for her, forever. Please, Belice. Help. Help me. Help her. I beg you. My first and last plea to you, big sister.”</p>
<p>Belice had no idea how to respond. He had never referred to her as big sister. She had no idea that he had cared for Amethyst so much.</p>
<p>“Alexcent, calm yourself and tell me what happened. I can’t help you if you don’t talk to me clearly.”</p>
<p>“I made a deal with her.”</p>
<p>“A deal? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I had a contract marriage with her. I promised her that by the contract of marriage, I would help her become someone else, to live a new and free life.” Belice couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “But then I started to love her, so she left. I was so stupid.”</p>
<p>“You were.” Belice was not going to pretend any different. A contract marriage. What was he thinking? Alexcent lifted his face to look at her. He appeared to be in so much pain that Belice’s heart began to ache on his behalf.</p>
<p>“I can’t let her go like this,” Alexcant began muttering again. “I’m going to wait, whether she’s coming back or not. I’m going to leave my side empty forever more, so she can come back anytime. I need your power. I need you to make sure her family doesn’t worry about her. Create some excuse so no one will doubt her disappearance. Then she’ll have to come back to me! I can’t do this alone, but you can do this for me!”</p>
<p>“Ah, Alexcent. What am I going to do with you?” Belice patted Alexcent on the head as he sobbed into her knees. She shook her head, amazed that Amethyst had left him. Amazed that her brother was so easily reduced to a blubbering fool who wouldn’t stop begging for her help. This was going to be a long night. And tomorrow, Belice would make sure that a rumour was spread, saying that the Duchess Skad had travelled abroad to study on the Empress’ recommendation.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Gen and Hill stood in the duke’s office, sweating nervously as they went through reports.</p>
<p>“Arin is the daughter of Marquis Keston?” Alexcent asked coldly, like a machine with no emotion.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Hill answered. “A few people saw her coming out of the armory on the day of the hunting tournament.”</p>
<p>“That’s not enough evidence,” Alexcent stated.</p>
<p>“We interrogated her based on the evidence and she admitted that she tampered with madam’s gun. She was scared that you had been hurt, so she admitted it willingly. Also, the fact that there was some gunpowder on her hand when she didn’t hunt made her guilt clear.” Hill swallowed nervously as he awaited Alexcent’s reaction. Especially when he referred to ma’am, as Amethyst’s name was now forbidden to be uttered.</p>
<p>Alexcent looked over the document in front of him. “I see. Gen, take care of the Marquis.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness, Maquis Keston is Duke Roden’s subordinate. To bypass the order of authority and remove his title, all because of his daughter, isn’t it too much?” Gen immediately closed his mouth, scared, as he saw Alexcent’s face. His eyes were filled with bloody madness.</p>
<p>“There are many people that can replace the Marquis. The Empire’s duke almost died because of him so I’m sure Sir Roden would understand.” Alexcent stated, coldly.</p>
<p>“As you wish,” Gen and Hill both answered quickly.</p>
<p>Duke Skad had become a dangerous man. Tomorrow, one noble family would disappear as if they had never even existed in the Sehar Empire.</p>
