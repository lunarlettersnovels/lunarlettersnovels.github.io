            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 10 – Contract Marriage</strong></p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“Find me someone, to have a contract marriage with.”</p>
<p>Incredulous, Gen asked., “Are you serious about this?”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you the one who brought up this idea? Hence, go and find someone”</p>
<p>“But…Yes, I understand.”</p>
<p>The duke’s orders were always short and precise. Never to be disobeyed.</p>
<p>Gen had suggested it as a joke, but now felt obliged as the duke had taken him seriously. He wondered if he would be able to find a woman who would want to marry the bloody duke or the monstrous prince of blood.</p>
<p><em>Where could he find a partner for him</em>?</p>
<p>He was the duke of the nation and the one and only brother to the emp. His partner, even if she wasn’t a member of the royal family, had to at least be someone from a noble ranked family.</p>
<p><em>Furthermore, a marriage based on a contract?</em></p>
<p>It was impossible to find the daughter of a noble family who would agree to this when she could be abandoned at any point in time. But it was too late to take back his words.</p>
<p>Gen regretted his frankness and blamed himself. Yet, the only way to save his life would be to look for a promising lady. Swearing to himself never to speak his thoughts out loud, he exited the study.</p>
<p>Once Gen exited the room the duke got out of his chair and walked over to look out at the scenery from the glass window.</p>
<p>“A contract marriage…that doesn’t sound too bad.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but smile. As long as it succeeds, he would be able to avoid Belice’s nagging for a while.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A forlorn Gen entered the imperial palace with a reply to exactly the 58th letter. He was walking down the long corridor towards the empress’s study when he heard voices from afar so stopped to listen.</p>
<p>“Count Lohikin, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I am very sorry Marquis Crenson. I am not sure how to express this myself. My daughter suddenly says she doesn’t want to ever get married.”</p>
<p>“Was my son not to her liking?”</p>
<p>“No! Of course not. Please don’t take this the wrong way. How could she dislike your son whom she’s never met. It’s not that she doesn’t want to marry your son but says she hates marriage all together. Which also puts me in a very compromising position.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, well. If that is how the young lady feels then I’m sure you must be frustrated. Isn’t she already twenty this year?”</p>
<p>“Well what’s the point of me stressing over it? It’s not like I could tie her up and force her into one. I am gravely worried that she would change her mind tomorrow and ask for a marriage partner.”</p>
<p>“Well then, I suppose we should consider this engagement never happened. It is a pity. I truly wanted to form family ties with you, Count Lohikin.”</p>
<p>“Likewise. I regret this missed relationship with you Marquis Crenson. However, thank you for understanding.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m sure we can always create other relationships in the future? I hear you have another daughter?”</p>
<p>“Yes! That is right. Oh my, shall we carry on our conversation some place else?</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>As their conversation became longer, Count Lohikin and Marquis Crenson paused to walk far away from the corridor.</p>
<p><em>A young lady that dislikes marriage… How surprising that someone else shares the same thought as his highness. Count Lohikin must be going through quite the trouble.</em></p>
<p>Gen resumed walking as the head of the two families voices faded away then came to a sudden halt.</p>
<p><em>Wait….! Why hadn’t I thought of this before? If two people who dislike marriage come together based on their own needs and form a contract to fool the eyes of others…</em></p>
<p>He quietly drew the cross across his chest.</p>
<p>“Oh! God! Thank you.”</p>
<p>Then with a soft smile he watched the two until they disappeared. Things were going too well, he couldn’t help but feel happy.</p>
<p><em>The daughter of Count Lohikin…I must look into her immediately. Ahhh! Before that I must see Her Majesty first.</em></p>
<p>Meeting the empress placed tremendous pressure on him. Before he knew it, he was standing outside the door of her study. Gen took a deep breath and lightly knocked on the door.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>“I pray for the glory of the Sehar empire and the blessing of the goddess to the Empress Belice. I am Gerald Artin, the first assistant of the Skad household offering you my gre-”</p>
<p>“You can skip the greetings. Gen, I guess you brought me the usual reply.”</p>
<p>“My sincere apologies to Your Highness.” Gen bowed deeply and apologised to Belice.</p>
<p>“Why should you be sorry. So, has Alexcent’s leg fully healed?”</p>
<p>“Sorry? His Highness was never injured.” He had seen the duke just this morning and he had been perfectly fine. It couldn’t be that something had happened on his way here.</p>
<p>“Oh. I thought he broke his leg since he hasn’t shown up for some time.”</p>
<p>“Th-that…” Drops of sweat started to form on his forehead. He opened and closed his mouth then decided to shut it all together.</p>
<p>Belice’s scarlet eyes shone beneath her elaborately and intricately braided platinum hair. The same sharp eyes as the duke, a beautiful and cold smile adorning her lips. But unlike her mouth, her eyes were not smiling.</p>
<p>Just being in the same space with someone whose expression he couldn’t read made Gen feel strangled and pressured. It was indeed the charisma and dignity of an empire’s ruler, which must be why the duke was avoiding her as much as possible.</p>
<p>The empress tapped on the letter placed on her table and continued. “Forget it, just tell him to make sure he attends the commemoration party for the Belicean palace. If he doesn’t I will really break his leg.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>With a short sigh, Gen left the empress’ study. Then he went on to immediately investigate on the daughter of Count Lohikin.</p>
