            <p><strong>Chapter 118 – There Can Never Be Two Queens (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Did you bring my training attire?” asked Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said her maid.</p>
<p>“Bring it over.”</p>
<p>“Count, shouldn’t you take a rest? I’m worried that you will overexert yourself.”</p>
<p>Count Glacia didn’t respond and just glared at her maid.</p>
<p>“S-sorry. I will prepare it immediately,” said the maid and scurried off.</p>
<p><em>I might not be able to cross the line, but standing on that line, I can always tease it a little bit, </em>thought Count Glacia<em>. I am sorry Lady Skad, I have no animosity towards you but the person who gets to rein this place is me. I have worked for it all my life and I can’t let you be an obstacle. I rule here, in the past and in the future. There can never be two queens. You may hold the title, but I will have everything else. or me to not cross the line, I need to do what I do best while standing on the line.<br>
</em><br>
***</p>
<p>Buer and Leyrian sighed. Phil was full of smiles as Alexcent guided Amethyst to a section of training ground a little further away.</p>
<p>“Is that the sword you had ordered?” asked Alexcent, indicating the one in her hand.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“May I?” he asked and extended his hand. Amethyst handed him the word. Alexcent took it and hefted it and swung it once. He studied it closely. Amethyst thought the sword must not be bad at all, since it was made from ground elements of mana stone.</p>
<p>“It’s not bad,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she said.</p>
<p>He handed it back to her. Amethyst responded in simple and short words. And Alexcent was getting impatient. <em>I am the one who is upset with her so why is she acting like that? </em>He wondered. <em>Should I just take hold of her cheeks and shake her to her senses?</em></p>
<p>“Okay, great,” said Alexcent, “You try to swing it once then I will—”</p>
<p>“Oh my, are you training already?” interrupted a voice. Count Glacia appeared beside them.</p>
<p>Amethyst narrowed her eyes. <em>What is she doing here? </em>She was getting annoyed with Count Glacia always popping up where she wasn’t needed. Amethyst forced a smile.</p>
<p>“You attire…,” she said.</p>
<p>“Ah, hearing about you learning swordsmanship, it reminded me of my old days,” said Count Glacia, smiling, “I couldn’t hold back so I came for a light practice. I can get rusty now, can I?”</p>
<p>“Old days?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes!” said Count Glacia, “I used to be a knight. I was sworn in, even.”</p>
<p>A female knight and a female count. Authority over male-dominated positions. Her opponent was a formidable one.</p>
<p>“Count Glacia!” called Buer happily, “It’s been so long!” Buer bounded over to her. “Leyrian!” he called, “It’s Count Glacia!”</p>
<p>Leyrian shook his head helplessly. <em>Clueless, that idiot! </em>Leyrian thought. He shot a feeting glance at Amethyst and walked over to where Count Glacia stood.</p>
<p>“It’s been very long since we last met, Count Glacia,” said Leyrian.</p>
<p>“Hasn’t it?” said Count Glacia, beaming,</p>
<p>From the way the knights surrounded her and talked in a very friendly way, Count Glacia must have been a reputable knight among their midst. Alexcent looked dead pan. Amethyst wondered what he was thinking.</p>
<p>“This is the first time we have seen you training here ever since you became a count.”</p>
<p>“Is it?” chuckled Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“Yes! The first time we met was when you were the personal guard of the previous count,” said Buer.</p>
<p>“Of course!” said Count Glacia, “I recall it now. Sir Buer had just been sworn in and was full of passion and energy.”</p>
<p>“Oh, please!” said Buer, flustered, “Please forget that. I was very young and naïve. Now I am a commander to a section!”</p>
<p>“I am not surprised,” said Count Glacia, “Your skills, even then, was top notch.”</p>
<p>Amethyst listened a little. She must have become a Countess after serving as the personal guard of the previous Count. This conversation shed a little light on Count Glacia’s past that Amethyst was curious about. <em>What am I doing listening to this? Should I just go back now?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst was debating whether she should make a run for it when Alexcent’s arms came around her shoulders. “Come,” he said, “Let’s train.” He was about to steer her further away when Count Glacia spoke.</p>
<p>“Your Highness,” said Count Glacia, “It has been a very long time, may I request a match with you?”</p>
<p>“What?!” Intoned Amethyst and Alexcent together. Fortunately, hers was drowned out by his voice.</p>
<p>“It has indeed been ages!” said Buer, excitedly, “Please show us your moves!”</p>
<p>Leyrian tried to rein Buer lest he ran his mouth and got everyone killed by the duke’s wrath, but it was in vain. There was no stopping Buer. Alexcent seemed distressed. He looked at her.</p>
<p><em>Why are you looking at me like that? </em>Amethyst thought as her heart fluttered. Buer came to her rescue.</p>
<p>“This will help you, Madam,” said Buer.</p>
<p>“How?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“The knights can teach you everything they know,” said Buer, “But most of them play rough. Count Glacia fights very differently. Her moves are softer and very agile. It might help you decide your stance and style since your build is similar.”</p>
