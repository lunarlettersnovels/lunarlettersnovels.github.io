            <p><strong>Chapter 303</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst and Count Glacia held each other while panting. “I was wrong.”</p>
<p>Count Glacia was finally able to spit something out.</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“About your skill. Considering what I saw today, you may not be advanced yet but you are not a beginner either.</p>
<p><em>I should be thankful for that.</em> It was definitely the result of his tough training sessions.</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to Alec. Anyways, your skills are very good.”</p>
<p>“I kept training even after I had acquired the title. I was a high knight.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Amethsyt nodded. It was believable after all this. The ash-colored knights left and the ones that escorted people the stream started to come back and clean up.</p>
<p>After that, Alexcent’s horse was seen in the horizon. He jumped off and quickly embraced his wife. She could tell how fast he came as he was alone.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he whispered. Amethyst patted him as he buried his face into her neck while his shoulders slouched.</p>
<p>“Everything’s ok now. Everyone’s ok.”</p>
<p>He believed her and yet he was worried at a possible uncertain outcome. He had hurried so much that he used attack magic to destroy the demons.</p>
<p>Despite knowing that she was okay, he disparaged himself for letting her fight alone. He was afraid that she would resent him for not coming to save her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for leaving you alone.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. You were also in danger. And you should praise me instead.”</p>
<p>“Praise you?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I destroyed the demons! Of course, Count Glacia and the ash coloured knights helped. But isn’t this pretty good?”</p>
<p>“You’re really something.”</p>
<p>Alexcent hugged Amethyst again. And then kissed her on the lips.</p>
<p>“Hm, my lord.” Count Glacia coughed while trying not to look. The knights around them also tried to give the couple some privacy.</p>
<p>Alexcent smiled at her while holding her tightly. “Good job.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Amethyst beamed at him.</p>
<p>“The hunting tournament is over with this.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me?” Count Glacia was surprised as the hunting tournament that usually went on for days ended in a single day.</p>
<p>“Yes. Since you killed all of them with magic. It should be quiet for a while.”</p>
<p>Gen added. Then he bowed politely to Amethyst. “I was amazed by your skill.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“We’ll be counting on you from on.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know how to react to Gen. Then she excitedly perked up and asked, “By the way, how can you use magic? Didn’t you say you promised nobles to use it only during war?”</p>
<p>Amethyst had remembered the time when he received bunch of complaints for using magic.</p>
<p>“It’s ok.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“We’re deep in the woods so they wouldn’t know, and there aren’t anyone here that would complain about using magic here. We trust each other quite a lot.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“So don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Alexcent bumped his forehead into hers.</p>
<p>“That’s right! We might’ve died if it wasn’t for the duke.”</p>
<p>“Of course, we were desperate. Who would object to Our Lord saving us?”</p>
<p>“If they knew how much the demons have populated suddenly, no one would object. If it wasn’t for the duke, no one would’ve been able to stop them.”</p>
<p>The masters that followed Alexcent twinkled their eyes at the word trust and defended him.</p>
<p>It had become the shortest hunting tournament since the annual festival, but it ended up with a bit of change in their relationship.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Duke Skad’s family’s annual festival was over.</p>
<p>It was an annual festival that everyone was proud of. They promised to communicate regarding the public education facility establishment through the magical message pigeon.</p>
<p>Everyone was sad to each other go.</p>
<p>They all said goodbyes in front of the duke mansion. Count Glacia stood in front of Amethyst first. “I’m looking forward to your skill improving. Don’t you dare stop training.”</p>
<p>She extended her hand and Amethyst grabbed it for a handshake.</p>
<p>Lupes said his goodbye to the Skad couple and escorted Count Glacia up the carriage.</p>
<p>Then Countess Citri hugged Amethyst like earlier days. “Ma’am, I’ll miss you.”</p>
<p>“Please take care. Make sure to let me know the good news.”</p>
<p>“Of course!” Amethyst’s eyes became teary at the farrewells.</p>
<p>And she said to everyone. “Please visit us even if it isn’t for the annual festival. You’re always welcome.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we will.” The noble ladies smiled brightly and got on their carriage. Even while the carriage was disappearing, Amethyst stood there for a while, and Alexcent stood by her without a word.</p>
<p>While the servants were wrapping up the festivities, Amethyst received an unexpected letter.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The letters that were sent to Amethyst were stacked neatly on her desk.</p>
<p>Lunia always put red strings on the ones Amethyst must check, blue strings on the ones she could disregard, and yellow strings on the ones she wasn’t sure where it came from.</p>
<p>Amethyst checked the letters after her morning business. She checked the yellow string letters that she wouldn’t have looked at normally.</p>
<p>The envelope that said ‘To Carol’ was from Hutchmoon.</p>
<p>“It’s yours, right? Isn’t Carol the name you used before?’</p>
<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>
<p>“But, Hutchmoon? Isn’t that the end of the Empire?”</p>
<p>Amethyst shrugged at Lunia’s words and tore open the envelope. She slowly read the letter.</p>
<p>“Can I ask you what it is?”</p>
<p>Lunia carefully asked as Amethyst frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“It’s from a friend.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“It says she got divorced.”</p>
<p>“Oh…. How unfortunate.”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p><em>I thought Pauline was loved by her husband…. Did something terrible happen? Or did they have a problem that I don’t know about. So that’s why she couldn’t tell me.</em></p>
