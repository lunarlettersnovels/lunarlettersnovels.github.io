            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 72</strong></p>
<p>Pon and Lunia seemed a little shocked to see Amethyst in the office. She had decided that if she was to do a good job of managing everything, she needed help.</p>
<p>“Pon,” she said.</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” said Pon.</p>
<p>“Could you show me the documents that you showed me recently?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, Madam,” he said, “I thought you might look for them, so I already had them prepared.”</p>
<p>Pon was a very efficient butler. After the incident with Dajal, he was certain that she would expect him to show her every information and oversee the matters of the household. He had prepared everything ahead of time.</p>
<p>Amethyst scanned the documents he handed to her. Even at first glance, she could make out the problem and the numerous leakages. She had a habit of keeping a track of her expenses as a spending log; she had been doing it for the past ten years. Hence, it wasn’t very difficult to skim through the pages and understand the problem.</p>
<p>“Pon, and Lunia,” she addressed them, “I am sure you are aware about yesterday’s incident. Dajal’s post is vacant as of now and there are numerous flaws that need attention. Which is why, I will require your assistance in this matter.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Madam,” said Pon.</p>
<p>“Always at your service,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“I am going to address a few issues present here,” she indicated the document, “But I am not sure I am fully ready to take over the matters of the household. So your assistance and support will be much appreciated.”</p>
<p>“Understood, Madam,” said Pon and Lunia, unanimously.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Amethyst. “I see you issue new uniforms every week?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” said Pon, “That is correct.”</p>
<p>“Why so? It seems like a waste,” she said.</p>
<p>“The staff serve you and the Lord in close proximity,” Pon explained, “Clean and fresh uniforms are of utmost importance.”</p>
<p>“Even so, a new uniform once a week is very extravagant,” she said, “Let’s provide three uniforms for a person when they join, with some extra clothes. That would be enough until the uniforms become worn or damaged. After that, I will pay for the new ones.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Oh, and this here,” she said, pointing to a particular entry which showed a huge amount of expenses, “This is a very great amount for some bulk purchase. What is this for?”</p>
<p>“We bulk purchase our cleaning tools and equipment, Madam.”</p>
<p>“We spend this amount of money just for cleaning?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Correct, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Wow,” she said, stunned, “I know that this is a Prince’s Mansion, but to think we splurge so much on just cleaning….”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Madam,” said Pon.</p>
<p>“Pon, it wasn’t a compliment!” she said, “This is a waste.”</p>
<p>Pon looked disappointed. “My apologies, Madam,” he said, “But to maintain cleanliness, we dispose of the rags and tools after use.”</p>
<p>“How many rags and cleaning equipment could we possibly need?” asked Amethyst, flabbergasted. She wanted to let out a curse, but she composed herself. “We can reuse the rags and other cleaning tools,” she explained, “As for cleanliness, the tools and the rags can be boiled to sanitize them. Even better, we can use lemon while boiling, it has anti-bacterial as well as whitening effect. That way we can reduce wasting resources.”</p>
<p>“So, we boil the rags after use?” asked Pon for confirmation.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, “We can prepare a large pot and mix in lemon or white vinegar with water, and boil the rags after use to sanitize them. Instruct the maids on this. It will be much more resourceful. We can buy new ones if the rags and tools become damaged or unusable.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” said Pon, “Understood. I will do so.”</p>
<p>“This part is clearly a waste, so reduce the purchase of this,” said Amethyst, indicating the unnecessary expenses. “Here, and here as well.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” said Pon.</p>
<p>Soon the huge pile of documents reduced to only several pages that needed to be attended to. “I think that should do for now, regarding the household expenses,” she said, picking up another file on the table marked ‘Employees Welfare’.</p>
<p>“I heard a maid was fired from her job because she was pregnant,” she said, as she leafed through the document. “Is that true?”</p>
<p>“They leave voluntarily, Madam,” said Pon, “They find it hard to continue the work in such circumstances, so they leave.”</p>
<p>“It is not ‘voluntary’ Pon,” she said, “I think the unfeasible circumstances implicitly force them to resign from their jobs. From this day forth, anyone pregnant will be given half a year of maternity leave which will, of course, be paid. They will also be allowed two years of postpartum parental leave. They will, of course, be paid during this time. If they choose to return to work, they will be given flexible working hours. It is hard as it is for working mothers.”</p>
<p>“Will these all come under paid leave?” asked Pon, surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, “We will of course pay them the full wage for the maternity leave of half a year. They will be paid a full wage for the first year of their postpartum parental leave and 80% for the next year. I will pay them the remaining 20% if they are willing to return to work. Why do you ask? Do we not have enough budget for this?”</p>
<p>“We have ample budget, Madam,” said Pon, respectfully, “It’s just… nobody has thought of the welfare of the employees in such a manner before.”</p>
<p>“Well, someone having to leave their jobs just because they are pregnant seems very brutal, doesn’t it?” she asked, absentmindedly, still turning the pages of the document in her hand.</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” agreed Pon, wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>“Will you be so kind as to call Roman for me?” she asked.</p>
