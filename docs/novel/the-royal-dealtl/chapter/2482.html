            <p><strong>Chapter 186</strong></p>
<p>There were hand-made cookies in cute shapes. “Wow! It looks delicious.” Amethyst’s eyes glistened at the sight of the sweets. “Sit down. Let’s eat these together.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m fine, ”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you’re fine? If you came all the way here with the cookies, you must have a taste of them as well.”</p>
<p>Barden sat a little distant from Amethyst, perhaps feeling shy. Slowly, he picked the cookies she was offering him and put them in his mouth. So did Amethyst.</p>
<p>“How is it?” He couldn’t help but ask as the duchess finished her first bite.</p>
<p>“Mm, it’s delicious. It’s not too sweet, and I like the texture. It’s very savory the more I chew. Who made this?”</p>
<p>“I-it’s me.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Barden, you made it yourself?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s a hobby of mine.” Barden flushed.</p>
<p>“Wow, what an admirable hobby.”</p>
<p>With this sudden praise, Barden smiled a fraction. “Is that so? When I was at the academy, I was teased a lot for not being suitable enough as a brave knight. Hence, I abstained from baking always…”</p>
<p>“What? But with this skill, it must be something you’ve done more than once or twice.”</p>
<p>“It’s not to that extent. Whenever I was having a hard time, I tried to bake and now, my cookies have finally become an edible standard.”</p>
<p>“Edible?” Amethyst shook her head, “Don’t lie! It’s really good!”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“By the way, Barden, do you have hard times too?”</p>
<p>“Well…of course. When things don’t work out the way you want it to… like when the person you like doesn’t know how you feel…”</p>
<p><em>Oh, that’s right. He has a crush on my sister. Maybe it’s because we are like-minded? Somehow, I just can’t hate him.</em></p>
<p>“Haha, I see. I think I know how that feels.”</p>
<p>Hearing her reply, Barden asked. “I’ve been curious since before. How is your relationship with the duke?”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I apologize, my lady. I simply… can’t help but feel concerned since you’re a family member of the woman I like.”</p>
<p>“We…” His question was both simple and difficult to answer. Even though they were believed to be husband and wife, their marriage wasn’t real at all. What’s more, he was someone she loved but couldn’t love for everything will come at end soon enough—when the contract reaches its finality.</p>
<p>Her heart started to ache from being unable to speak the truth. Barden, sensing her discomfort, broke the silence first.</p>
<p>“If you feel uncomfortable, you need not answer me. You’re not obligated to tell me.”</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded, finding it hard to say the right words. <em>He must find it weird. Or maybe he’s already guessed what kind of relationship we are in.</em></p>
<p>Instead of answering his question, Amethyst changed the subject. “Since when have you liked Merril?”</p>
<p>“Well…When I was in the academy taking accounting as one of my minor modules, I knew then.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Every time during the lesson, her sparkling attentive eyes stood out. I was amazed at how passionate she was for such a boring class.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Once I ran into her in the library. We started talking about the lesson…and met regularly after that. Everytime we did, she talked about her sister.”</p>
<p>“About me?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She said while she easily gives up on everything, she said you always do your best in everything. So, she was motivated to follow your footsteps to try her best not to give up.”</p>
<p><em>Was I like that? I guess Amethyst’ past was very different from mine. She must have loved herself a lot.</em></p>
<p>Momentarily, she wondered how the original Amethyst loved herself. She wondered what kind of person she is and how was she so confident.</p>
<p><em>Now that I think of it I’ve never had a deep conversation with Merril, so I’ll take the time to talk to her next time I visit.</em></p>
<p>Looking at the man before her, she felt fondness over him. He was a good person, and Amethyst wanted to help him the best she could.</p>
<p>“Ah, Merill likes to snack on things. She will always grab the cookies in the morning and place them on her plate. If not, she will steal them all.”</p>
<p>Barden listened to her with keenness, “Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it you get the chance you should give her your handmade cookies. She might like them.”</p>
<p>“But, if a knight who should be yielding swords, gifts her a cookie she might find it weird…”</p>
<p>“Oh my, what do you mean?! From where I’m from, guys who cook are the big hit! They call them SGC.”</p>
<p>“SGC?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sexy guys who cook!”</p>
<p>Barden had a blank expression on his face as he said, “Pfft, this is the first time I’ve heard of such a thing. I didn’t know guys who cook are popular in the mansion.”</p>
<p><em>Ah, oh dear. That was a near miss.</em></p>
<p>There were times when she made a big slip like this as she spoke of things that were out of context here. Fortunately, Barden seemed to have misunderstood.</p>
<p>“By the way Barden, did you realize that your conversation skills has gotten better?”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you can converse pretty naturally now.”</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to you, my lady.”</p>
<p>“Me? I didn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>“You’ve let me speak so casually and naturally.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…then try to continue this conversation.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Barden, can you teach me this recipe?”</p>
<p>“On how to make cookies?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s yummy so I want to make them myself.”</p>
<p>“Alright!”</p>
<p>The two continued with their conversation which was full of nonsensical things. Their laughter rang occasionally, and their hearts at ease.</p>
<p>But there was one person who couldn’t laugh at the picture of the two people having a great time.</p>
<p>It was Alexcent who was staring at them from afar.</p>
