            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 60</strong></p>
<p>As nobody stepped in, Amethyst turned to look at them. As though they were used to the sight, and just waiting for it to quickly end, not one of them displayed any expression on their faces.</p>
<p><em>For how long… for how long have these things happened repeatedly?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst turned to face the maids being whipped. The maid name Hebe was down on her knees and was begging.</p>
<p>“Please… I am sorry! Please forgive me!”</p>
<p>“Be quiet!”</p>
<p>“Aghhh!”</p>
<p><em>Whip! Whip!</em></p>
<p>The sound of the whip continued on. Then soon the thin whip started to cut into their flesh. Blood dripped from the tassels on the whip and brought about a grin on Dajal’s face. His opaque pupils were filled with excitement and his lips rose into a sadistic smile.</p>
<p>The sight of him made Amethyst shudder. He was going overboard to call this a warning. His act was going past excitement and more towards a frenzy. As she was about to step forward to stop him, a hand ceased her.</p>
<p>Amethyst turned to face the owner of the hand.</p>
<p><em>Roman!</em></p>
<p>As their eyes met, Roman shook her head and whispered softly, “You mustn’t.”</p>
<p>“But…!”</p>
<p>“They are not being reprimanded for doing a poor job.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Jane paid less bribes this month as she had to pay for her sister’s wedding, Carin too as her mother is not well. Hebe had to bail out her brother who got himself in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Then this means….!”</p>
<p>“Yes. This is a form of warning to everyone including you. If you get involved now, it’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“But… If we leave them like that then-” Amethyst was flabbergasted at this atrocity.</p>
<p>“He will stop soon. If you really want to reach your objective… you must hold out for now.”</p>
<p>“But… .”</p>
<p>Roman looked desperately at Amethyst. Then they heard a sharp voice.</p>
<p>“Who is chit-chatting away! Huh?” Dajal slowly made his way and stood in front of Roman. The leather tassels were now stuck together due to the blood, and with that, he poked at her chest.</p>
<p>Romans tried hard to stand still as she was pushed off balance.</p>
<p>“Have you still not come to your senses?!”</p>
<p>“No, Sir.”</p>
<p>“Just because I’ve been letting you off lately you now think I’m easy?”</p>
<p>“No, Sir.”</p>
<p>“Ya right. You always pretend to be upright but in truth, I know you’re busy spreading your legs for those knights.”</p>
<p>“I have never done such a thing.”</p>
<p>“Ha, everyone knows you are a prostitute so who will believe you!”</p>
<p>As Roman glared at him like she could kill him, Dajal flinched. Then surprised at his own reaction he raised his hand.</p>
<p>“This little wrench!”</p>
<p>“Sir Dajal! I am sorry!”</p>
<p>At Amethyst’s cries, Dajal stopped his hand that was inches away from Roman’s face.</p>
<p>“I… was new and unsure, so I was asking Roman for help.”</p>
<p>“You should choose a better person to ask.”</p>
<p>“I apologize.”</p>
<p>For some reason, Dajal backed off. Then he spat on the floor and barked, “I’ll end it here for today. Everyone back to your stations!”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Dajal disappeared and the maids left the scene. Some maids supported Hebe, Jane, and Carin and returned with them.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Amethyst asked Roman.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“I wonder why he backed off. I thought I was going to get hit….” It was bizarre how Dajal spared her.</p>
<p>“Carol… I think you should be careful.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“I think he has targeted… Carol as the next one.” Roman blurted out.</p>
<p>“What do you… oh my?!”</p>
<p><em>So just now that meant I was marked out.</em></p>
<p>“As much as possible try not to be alone with him.” She cautioned her mistress</p>
<p>“But I have to clean Dajal’s quarters.”</p>
<p>“Precisely… that’s why I worry. Always be on your guard. And if anything happens… run immediately.”</p>
<p>“Yes… I will be careful. By the way, I have always been curious. Why doesn’t Dajal fire you instead of harassing you so much? If I were him, I would fire those that opposed me. How do you get past it?”</p>
<p>“Well….To them, I’m the best example. To show what happens if you go against him. So he won’t fire me. And I know that other places are not much different. And nowhere pays as high as the prince’s mansion.”</p>
<p>“I see….”</p>
<p><em>Other noble households are not much different?</em></p>
<p><em>I wonder why the unfairness of the world is the same wherever you go. I wonder if this is the unspoken rule of life.</em></p>
<p>Similar patterns in societies, the unchanging history made Amethyst sick.</p>
<p>“I think it’s best if you go back and rest for today. You don’t look too well.” Roman suggested.</p>
<p>“I’m sure Dajal will look for me…”</p>
<p>“He won’t look for you today. After causing a scene like this he will quieten down for some time.” She reassured.</p>
<p>“Really?” Amethyst was a tad unsure.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then… I will go back for today.”</p>
<p>Only after returning to her bedroom, did Amethyst feel the tension loosen away. Then, she felt herself gag. The screaming of the maids rang in her ear. The sight of them being whipped was a traumatic experience in itself.</p>
<p><em>For how long had these things happened and remained unsaid… For how long?</em></p>
<p>She was overcome by shock and fear. She curled up under the sheets.</p>
<p>Today, she didn’t feel like running into Alexcent. She hated him for not knowing anything, not caring, and not doing anything. She hated him for even keeping Dajal by his side.</p>
<p><em>Quickly, as quickly as possible I need to find the proof. Then I need to chase him out of this place.</em></p>
<p><em>But what if… Alec doesn’t take my side because I’m only temporarily the Lady of the House? What if he corners me and tells me to know my place…</em></p>
<p>At the thought of such a possibility, the thought of his face pissed her off. She closed her eyes to fall asleep quickly before the man got back to the mansion.</p>
