            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 47</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Amethyst contemplated for a while but she just couldn’t stand by and do nothing. In the end, she headed towards their direction in the most authoritative manner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“What is all this ruckus?” She demanded when she got the scene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The knights withdrew their hands that had been harassing the maid and looked at Amethyst. They clearly appeared shocked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Ma …madam, it is nothing.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>They are not the knights I met before. Well of course they were the top of the ranks and wouldn’t be doing something like this. Then these people must be below them.</em></p>
<p>“If it’s nothing then why is that young lady crying?” she said, pointing towards the sobbing maid.</p>
<p>“Hahah, it’s because she likes it. Right?” The knight looked at the maid threateningly.</p>
<p>The maid seemed to understand what the situation meant. If she claimed that it wasn’t true she would need to pay a bigger price in the future. The maid continued to cower and tremble in fear as she barely managed a nod.</p>
<p>A frown formed on Amethyst’s forehead. “She likes it… I see. I must be mistaken then.”</p>
<p>Saying so she moved slowly towards the knights, and stood right in front of the one who had just been harassing the maid. Then, without a warning, reached and grabbed the knight’s bottom with a hand.</p>
<p>“Argh! Ma…madam!”</p>
<p>“Madam!”</p>
<p>The remaining knights and the sniffling maid were shocked; dumbstruck they looked at the duke’s newly wedded wife.</p>
<p>“Why? You said she likes it right? I was only doing the same? Did it offend you?” Amethyst levelled her gaze at the man.</p>
<p>The knight spoke with a flushed face, “Ma….madam you are a noble lady! Such acts are very—”</p>
<p>“What? Rude? Wrong?” She retorted.</p>
<p>“Both!” the knight hurriedly replied.</p>
<p>“Why? It’s right for a man to harass a woman, but not right if a woman harasses a man?”</p>
<p>The man was gobsmacked but soon managed to say, “Well….! It’s different!”</p>
<p>“What’s so different!” As Amethyst raised her voice suddenly, the knights flinched.</p>
<p>“Do you want to make women weaker than you kneel and beg since you are stronger than them? Why? Because they are weak? If they don’t have any power, does that mean you can treat them poorly? If that’s the case, then I truly haven’t done anything wrong have I? I’m sure you are not ignorant to be unable to differentiate between something someone likes and dislikes.”</p>
<p>“Madam—”</p>
<p>The knight must have felt flustered as he scratched his head.</p>
<p>“If you harass or bully a woman again, and can’t differentiate between what they like and dislike, and if a knight, who should be protecting the weak bullies others again … I will deprive you of your knighthood!”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“Do you think I won’t be able to do that? I have the power and influence to do so!”</p>
<p><em>I wonder where my courage has stemmed from. It might be because of something I had heard in passing.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Aside from the Emperor, you are the highest ranked woman in the Sehar empire!”</strong></em></p>
<p>The threat must have worked as the knights stood around awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Why are you standing around like that for? Where’s my answer.”</p>
<p>“— Yes.”</p>
<p>“Don’t ever forget that I am always watching you!” Amethyst finally looked at the maid and said, “You, follow me.”</p>
<p>“Yes … Madam.”</p>
<p>She left the knights behind and walked on, then turned her head back slightly. She pointed a finger at them and gestured with two fingers that she will always be watching, and then drew her index finger across her neck as if saying …<em>‘I am watching you, you break the promise, you’re dead.’</em></p>
<p><em>Ah, I’d always wanted to try this gesture on my boss but it seems like I’m using it like this.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst turned her head back and looked at the maid. She was still trembling and all tensed up.</p>
<p><em>Of course she is in shock. And scared. And also …. embarrassed. I’m sure these kinds of things happen. This too is a society, and such things can happen when and wherever.</em></p>
<p>“Are you all right?”</p>
<p>“Sorry? Yes, Madam. Th-thank you.”</p>
<p>It was a simple question, but the maid must have been very surprised as she burst into tears.</p>
<p>“Oh dear— ”</p>
<p>“I’m…I’m so sorry. I just— ”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. It’s okay…”</p>
<p>Amethyst hugged the maid gently and patted her back. Then slowly the girl seemed to calm down.</p>
<p>“Madam….I am fine now.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>She took a look at the maid who was stepping away from her, then grimaced as she caught sight of her sleeve. A sleeve could get tattered from working but hers was too much.</p>
<p>“Then…I will go back now. I still have things to do— ”</p>
<p>“All right. Then go back for now. But if something like this happens again, you must inform me immediately! All right?”</p>
<p>“Yo … you?” The maid was startled.</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“But …that is— ”</p>
<p>Amethyst smiled at the maid who was hesitating.</p>
<p>She finally came to a realization and said, “Yes….I will. Madam, thank you so much for today.”</p>
<p>“Go on. I realised I have something to do.” She urged her on, still wearing a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The maid bowed her head and then returned, while Amethyst quickly returned to the mansion.</p>
<p>Amethyst who had entered the mansion started calling out loud to the butler who wasn’t visible in her line of sight these days. “Pon, Pon!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>Pon, who had been obeying Alexcent’s direct orders to stay out of Amethyst’s sight, appeared as the mistress looked around for him. Even though it was the duke’s orders, he could not ignore things when it came to the affairs of the mansion. So he had been trying his best to carry out his business without getting in her way.</p>
<p>“Pon, assemble all the maids who work in the mansion immediately.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Without asking any question, Pon did as he was told.</p>
<p>One, two, slowly the maids of the mansion started to appear. The maid she had met today didn’t appear, but Amethyst started studying each and every one of them.</p>
