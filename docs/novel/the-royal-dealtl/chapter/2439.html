<p>“Why did you do it?” Alexcent growled at Duke Roden. He was furious that he would be forced to live a life he didn’t want.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Roden asked.</p>
<p>“Saving me. This would have been the perfect opportunity for the nobles to eliminate one of the most powerful houses.”</p>
<p>“Maybe. But no teacher would destroy such a talented disciple as you. I also have a duty to her Majesty, to find a way to preserve her family. Love is more powerful than duty.” Duke Roden patted Alexcent on the shoulder, then made sure that he was following behind him. “You’re of lower status than I am now. Don’t forget to act your part.”</p>
<p>Alexcent looked at Duke Roden, displeased with his new role. Gen approached before they left and Duke Roden gave them some space to sat their goodbyes.</p>
<p>“My Lord, I am sorry this did not end with better circumstances.”</p>
<p>“I thought I told you not to do anything, Gen. Really, to have such a disloyal subject.” Alexcent felt betrayed by Gen’s actions, but knew he did everything out of loyalty. He didn’t mean what he just said and he didn’t know if he should smile or cry.</p>
<p>“I will wait, my Lord. I’ll find away to return you to your formal glory.”</p>
<p>“Lord? I’m a slave now. Don’t wait for something that will never happen.”</p>
<p>“Then can I stop being formal to you?” Gen asked, with a wry smirk.</p>
<p>“Not in the least.” Alexcent said, smiling. They laughed and embraced each other in farewell. Then Alexcent turned and left with Duke Roden to be placed with a noble family and hidden from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After weeks of travelling aimlessly across the Sehar Empire, Amethyst settled in a city called Hutchmoon, on the border of the Empire. It was certainly larger than the villages that surrounded it, but did not come close to the size of the capital. As it lay on the border, there were significant options of lodging for travellers. From luxury hotels to communal housing and a series of choices in between, Amethyst was slightly overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Amethyst decided to rent a room long-term in a respectable house until she decided on a more permanent location to settle. The house was on the outskirts of Hutchmoon. It backed on to some beautiful landscapes, such as river and mountains, and was a popular tourist area. Once she settled, she enquired on a realtor to help locate a permanent home.</p>
<p>While waiting on the realtor to contact her, Amethyst decided to take a walk. The warm, spring-like weather was perfect for a stroll. As she stepped out of her door, she ran into the caretaker, Gigs, who was sweeping the porch. He was a friendly, middle-aged man who was always pleasant to her, especially since she paid for an entire month up front. Most renters only stayed a night or two.</p>
<p>“Heading out, are you?” Gigs asked with a smile. “Would you like me to arrange a carriage for you?”</p>
<p>“No, thank you. I think I’ll go for a walk in this lovely sun,” Amethyst replied.</p>
<p>“I see. Enjoy your time out.” Gigs gave her a silly bow and waved goodbye as she headed off.</p>
<p>The money Gen had given her to survive on was a fair sum. They were rare gold coins that had been minted to commemorate the establishment of the Empire. The value of each amounted to more than the traditional coinage and allowed her some luxuries. The identity card he gave her now bore the name Carol, which was the identity she was now going by. However, she had found it unnecessary to make use of it, as she found that by providing enough money up front bypassed many rules.</p>
<p>She was enjoying a life where she didn’t have to harvest potatoes to afford food to eat and could stay in a room that always had hot water. She may not have a personal maid, but Gigs was always ready to assist her in whatever she needed.</p>
<p>Amethyst hadn’t originally thought of settling here. She had only intended to get as far away from the capital as possible, so she bought a ride on the public carriage that travelled across the Empire and ended up in this border city. On her first day here, she stood on the banks of the wide river and looked into its depths. She knew if she continued her journey across the river, she would leave the Sehar Empire. That would probably have been the best option, but she still couldn’t let Alexcent go. If she left the Empire in which he lived, it would be final and she couldn’t bring herself to do that. So, she decided to settle here and make herself a permanent home.</p>
<p>The river sparkled brilliantly in the afternoon sun, as she walked leisurely along the shore. The air was fragrant with yellow and purple wildflowers that grew from the banks. A man approached over the hill, waving and smiling brightly. He called the name she now used. “Carol!”</p>
