            <p><strong>Chapter 142</strong></p>
<p>“Then let’s start preparing the food,” said one of the ladies.</p>
<p>“Shall we?”</p>
<p>“Roman, will you give us a hand?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Madam.”</p>
<p>While the knights put up the tents, the ladies decided to prepare the food. Baroness Zephyrs, Countess Houres and Roman went to wash and prepare the ingredients at the river while Countess Onslow, Countess Citri and Amethyst tried to get the fire started.</p>
<p>“First, we will need dry twigs and leaves…” said Amethyst, trying to recall the lessons on camping from her school days and the things she had read on the internet about camping and fire.</p>
<p>“I’ll go and gather the dry twigs and leaves,” volunteered Countess Citri.</p>
<p>“Don’t go too far,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Of course!” Countess Citri replied brightly. She walked to the periphery near the place where the knights were putting up the tents and gathered any twigs or dry leaves she could find.</p>
<p>“Lady Skad, do you think you can do it?” Countess Onslow asked cautiously.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I’m not sure…,” said Amethyst, “but all we can do now is keep trying.”</p>
<p>Amethyst took two dry twigs and started to rub the two together. But there was no sign of any fire or even smoke.  <em>Is this not the way? I would have watched some YouTube videos in my previous life if I had known this was going to happen.</em></p>
<p>She rubbed until her arm started to feel sore but still, there was no sign of any fire. Meanwhile, Baroness Zephyr and Countess Houres returned with the washed and ready ingredients for the food. They all gathered around Amethyst and observed.</p>
<p>Sensing that the twigs weren’t enough, Amethyst picked up two stones and hit them together. But it only made a very loud clanking sound without a spark. Nothing she did worked. She couldn’t get the fire started.</p>
<p>“It’s…not working,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Shall we just eat them raw?” said one of the ladies, “Some of these vegetables can be eaten raw.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think that is best!” said Amethyst, gratefully. <em>These ladies are so optimistic, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>what would I have done without them?</em></p>
<p>Sir Hill and Sir Buer, who had just finished setting up the tent, approached them.“Madam,” said Sir Buer, “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Trying to get a fire started…,” said Amethyst, “But it is not working.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Sir Buer, “If you will allow me.” He gestured for them to move back from the twigs. He unsheathed his sword and place it on the twigs, lightly. After a heartbeat, a sudden flame roared to life and the twigs caught fire.</p>
<p>“How did you do that?!” asked Amethyst, impressed.</p>
<p>“My sword contains fiery pyro blasts,” said Sir Buer, “It gives off the energy of fire when fighting.”</p>
<p><em>It was that simple! </em>Amethyst thought, feeling like an idiot. “Well, you should have told me!” she said.</p>
<p>“I apologize,” said Sir Buer, smiling awkwardly, “I was putting up the tent and didn’t know you wanted to make a fire.”</p>
<p>“Now that the fire is set,” said Amethyst, “Shall we cook?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” said one of the ladies, “I am hungry.”</p>
<p>“I will help,” offered Roman.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Amethyst. “I am going to get some water.” She picked up a large bucket and headed to the river.</p>
<p>“Madam, please,” said Sir Hill, “I will do it.”</p>
<p>“No, Sir Hill,” said Amethyst, “You have already helped me so much. I can do it.”</p>
<p>“But it will be very heavy,” said Sir Hill.</p>
<p>“That’s alright,” said Amethyst, gratefully, “We’ll handle it from here. We left our maids behind for that. If you do all our work, there will be no point to all this.”</p>
<p>“But…,” hesitated Sir Hill.</p>
<p>“Stay here,” said Amethyst, smiling. “And wait for us to cook something delicious.”</p>
<p>Amethyst walked to the river with the bucket. She washed her hands and rinsed the bucket. She looked at the other side of the river. Just as Sir Hill had said, there was a translucent reddish aura around the river. Knowing that Alexcent might be on the other side of it made her heart race.</p>
<p><em>If I cross the river, I can see him! </em>Amethyst mused and sighed. <em>Not today. Today was a day to enjoy camping with the ladies.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst carried the bucket full of water back to the camp. “Are we all set?” she asked as she reached the camping site. Sir Leyrian leapt to his feet and took the bucket from her hands.</p>
<p>“Yes!” intoned the ladies.</p>
<p>“Roman, please pass me the chicken,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>Roman passed her the bowl of chicken and the vegetables. Amethyst shifted the chicken and vegetables to a pot and filled it with water. “Now all we need to do is wait for this to boil,” she said.</p>
<p><em>Chicken soup is the best and easiest dish to cook while camping. Boil it and garnish it with some salt, pepper and other spices and done! </em>Amethyst thought. <em>It would have been nice if there was some rice too.</em></p>
<p>While they waited for the chicken to boil, Roman prepared some tea and handed it around. Lunia handed out some cookies and bread.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Sir Hill, on behalf of the knights.</p>
<p>“So, how do you like it?” asked Amethyst, cautiously.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Countess Citri.</p>
<p>“The camping,” said Amethyst, “I know it hasn’t been ideal. But do you like it so far?”</p>
<p>Amethyst was worried that the ladies might complain because they had never done it before. Having to do all the work, having to cook and put up tents. She was scared that they might have found it tiresome.</p>
<p>“Well, for me,” said Countess Citri, looking into the fire, “It’s the first time I have done something like this, so it is so much fun! It reminds me of my childhood. I used to be out and about, collecting leaves and flowers, getting mud all over me because I would always be hunting for stones near the river. I never thought I missed those things this much. It feels like I am young and free again.”</p>
