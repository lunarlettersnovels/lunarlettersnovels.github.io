            <p><strong>Chapter 280</strong></p>
<p>“That thing called the Eye of Goddess or something, I was going to give you that as a gift, but they seem to keep it hidden, so I couldn’t find it. So…”</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>“I got pissed off and killed them all.”</p>
<p>Belice laughed, knowing that Alexcent was messing with her. Truthfully, the gift wasn’t important. Even though he was away for a long time, it was still a war he was in. She just wanted to see him again.</p>
<p>“So, you were waiting for a gift, not for me?” Alexcent asked. He glared at her, looking upset</p>
<p>“Hey now, that’s not true. It’s always my loving brother first. But, since you don’t have a gift, can you do me a favour?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“How can you say no without hearing it?” Belice asked.</p>
<p>“It’ll be obvious.”</p>
<p>Belice stared at him, anger rising in her.</p>
<p>“Fine. I’ll listen to it first,” Alexcent conceded.</p>
<p>Belice calmed down. “There will be a trial against young Lady Julia soon. I need you to go to mother and…”</p>
<p>“No,” Alexcent was being obstinate. “I can’t do you that favour.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t even say what it was.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to tell me to ask the Empress to give her a light punishment. Correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Belice’s cheeks blushed a little.</p>
<p>“See. You’re too easy to read.”</p>
<p>“But Alexcent, I’m asking you nicely. It was just a normal conversation I had with Lady Julia and she probably didn’t have any ill intentions with what she said.”</p>
<p>Alexcent shook his head. It was still a firm ‘no’.</p>
<p>“Really? At this rate, no one’s going to want to be by my side.” Belice looked sad.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Alexcent asked.</p>
<p>“People are being executed whenever they speak to me. So, who is going to want to speak to me in the future? Even when I become the Empress, my advisors will be too scared to give me any proper advice!”</p>
<p>“Belice, you still can’t distinguish between sarcasm and advice? It was clearly sarcasm being spoken by a lowly daughter of a count to a princess that will soon become the Empress.”</p>
<p>“Alexcent, it was a misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>“Misunderstanding? Even though she dared to call you a whore who sells her body for a laugh?”</p>
<p>“Oh my god, she didn’t say it like that!”</p>
<p>“Whatever she called you, she was lucky that I wasn’t there.”</p>
<p>“Alexcent!” Belice couldn’t believe how arrogant he was being.</p>
<p>“What should I say? You’re just like mother!”</p>
<p>Belice lowered her head, pouting.</p>
<p>“Fine! Why don’t you just tell me to go find the Eye of the Goddess instead.” Alexcent was furious. “That’s easier for me than dealing with this.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need that rock.”</p>
<p>“Belice, you’re going to be an Empress.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“The Empress needs to be cruel sometime. You can’t act all nice when…”</p>
<p>“Never mind.” Belice stood up and left the room without looking back.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Caniel was heading to the drawing room where Duke Roden was waiting for her. As she approached, a young man exited the room and disappeared down the hall in the opposite direction. Caniel called Harin over, who happened to be nearby.</p>
<p>“Harin.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Who is that person that just left?”</p>
<p>Harin looked at the man hurrying away, then turned back. “He is Sir Michen, of Duke Roden’s family.”</p>
<p>“Michen? Isn’t he the grandson that Duke Roden boasts about all the time? Why is he in the palace?”</p>
<p>“He’s been coming into the palace with Duke Roden lately. From the rumours that have been circulating, Duke Roden has chosen him as his successor.”</p>
<p>“Successor?”</p>
<p>Even though Duke Roden’s eldest son was alive and well, he was trying to make his grandson the next duke instead. This was because his son, Sir Gason, was a well-known thug within the Empire. He was a smart boy, but had no intention on keeping up with his studies. Instead, he was causing all kinds of trouble. He was the biggest problem in the Roden family, which otherwise was considered the best family in the Empire. Caniel knew this well.</p>
<p>“It would be better for the family to give the title to someone else, rather than make that thug Gason the successor. What particular information do you know about that young man called Michen?”</p>
<p>“From what I have been told, he is smart, very educated and is diligent in his duties,” Harin informed her.</p>
<p>“So, he is definitely not anything like his father. See if you can dig up anything on him.”</p>
<p>“As you wish, Your Majesty.” Harin bowed.</p>
<p>Caniel turned and entered the drawing room where Duke Roden was waiting. As the Duke stood to greet her, she got right down to business.</p>
<p>“So, I heard that you have chosen Sir Michen as your successor. Why not Sir Gason?” she asked, before Duke Roden could say a word.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty. My son isn’t fit to rule. Thankfully, he was good enough to raise an extremely smart grandson.” Duke Roden set down the tea he had been holding and looked some reaction in Caniel. She just smiled, so he continued. “I have a request for you.”</p>
<p>Caniel had been wondering what the reason was for Duke Roden’s visit. She thought it might have something to do with Lady Julia’s trial. She became wary at the word ‘request’.</p>
<p>“It’s not anything grand,” Duke Roden continued. “As you know, there are some nobles that are insisting my son Gason become the next duke.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Caniel already knew this but was surprised that the request had nothing to do with the trial.</p>
