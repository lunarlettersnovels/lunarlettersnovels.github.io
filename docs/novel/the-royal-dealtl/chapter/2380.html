            <p><strong>Chapter 288</strong></p>
<p>Belice was relaxing in her chambers when a servant entered.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Duke Roden is requesting a meeting with you.”</p>
<p>“Fine.” Belice stood up from her bed and went to the sitting room outside. “Please bring him in.”</p>
<p>Michen entered, holding a document in his hand. “I heard you were here, so I came looking for you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my rooms here are more comfortable.”</p>
<p>“I have something to inform you of,” he said.</p>
<p>Belice understood that this was a private matter and made sure all of the servants were out of the room. Michen looked around. This room was where they spent most of their time during Belice’s studies.</p>
<p>“So, what is this important business?” Belice asked.</p>
<p>Michen took a deep breath. “It’s about the order you gave me.”</p>
<p>“Is it done?” Belice asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. Would you like to see it?”</p>
<p>Michen handed her the document he had been holding. Belice slowly scanned through each of the pages. It was the list of candidates for the title of prince consort, just as she asked. Belice sighed, realizing his intention must be for her to marry someone else.</p>
<p>“Do they qualify with the characteristics I requested?” she asked as she looked over the documents.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve made sure all of the characteristics you mentioned were included.” Michen chose from a slew of nobles and narrowed the list down to five candidates. He scored them by family, personality, culture, education, body type, and a number of other features.</p>
<p>He had gone back and forth a hundred times on whether he should show Belice this. He knew this was something he couldn’t put off too long so decided to just get it done. Secretly, he hoped that she wouldn’t like any of the candidates and just reject them all. The thing that confused him the most was the description of the perfect candidate was something he had said to her. What did that mean?</p>
<p>Michen clenched his fists, as Belice continued to review the candidates. He decided to be bold. Even if it was treason, what he was about to do, he needed to know. He took a step towards her, as if he was possessed. Belice felt him get close and looked up at him. He took the moment.</p>
<p>“Forgive me for what I do,” Michen said, before placing his lips on hers.</p>
<p>Belice’s eyes widened in shock, but then closed as the passion overcame her. The documents she held crumpled in her fist and fell to the floor. Michen embraced her as she didn’t reject him. They confirmed each other’s feelings through the kiss, their tongues dancing with each other. Michen’s breathing got heavier. So did Belice’s, as she let out a satisfied sigh.</p>
<p>A knock at the door startled them back to their senses. The single mass of entwined limbs instantly split back into two, as the jumped apart.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Belice called, a little harshly and out of breath.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, my apologies,” a servant said, poking her head into the room, “but an urgent message from the Roden mansion came. They said it was about the lady.”</p>
<p>Michen frowned and turned to Belice. “Your Majesty, my apologies. I’ll return to hear your punishment for my actions later.”</p>
<p>Belice stared into his hungry eyes and nodded. Michen quickly left.</p>
<p>She sat alone and she began to tear up. What was she supposed to think now? He kisses her and then apologizes? The message was definitely talking about Loyalterre. She was the only lady, that Belice knew of, that was staying in Michen’s house. It almost sounded like he was saying the kiss was a mistake. Belice began crying uncontrollably.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Michen received the urgent message that had been sent from Hennessey. Duke Skad had taken Loyalterre. Michen quickly ordered his horseman to take him to Duke Skad’s mansion. What could that monster want with Loyalterre? Michen spent the entire journey worrying about the answers to that question.</p>
<p>Loyalterre was like an innocent child. She knew nothing about Alexcent. He would kill anyone that displeased him and the fact that he took Loyalterre meant he had some sort of agenda. Michen was worried that she would be dead before he could find her. She was the only family he had left now.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A carriage drove up to the entrance of Duke Roden’s mansion. Hennessey met the servant that stepped out of the carriage.</p>
<p>“I come to escort Lady Loyalterre on Duke Skad’s orders,” the servant announced.</p>
<p>“How rude of you to ask for such a thing without making an appointment,” Hennessey said, angered.</p>
<p>“My apologies. I’m just following the orders I was given. Where is Lady Loyalterre?”</p>
<p>“She is not available. Return to your master and come back with an appointment.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that is not possible.”</p>
<p>Hennessey was furious with Duke Skad’s servant’s behaviour. The servant was acting as arrogantly as his master did. As Hennessey continued to argue with the servant and attempted to make him leave, Loyalterre came out onto the front landing. A maid had informed her of the commotion outside.</p>
<p>“Was someone looking for me?” she asked the men who were arguing in the laneway.</p>
<p>“Greetings, Lady Loyalterre. My name is Buer. I am here to escort you to meet Duke Skad, on his orders.”</p>
<p>Loyalterre slowly looked the servant over. He was too buff to be a simple messenger. Also, he wore a sword on the belt around his waist.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment,” Loyalterre said, deciding. “I’ll get ready to leave.”</p>
<p>“Miss!” Hennessey tried to stop her but Loyalterre turned and smiled.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, Hennessey. I also wish to meet him. Besides, that man is not a simple messenger. If I don’t go willingly, he will probably force it. Why else would he wear a sword?”</p>
<p>“I will go with you,” Hennessey insisted.</p>
<p>“No need. When I saw him at the banquet, Duke Skad appeared gruff but still had some manners. I am sure that I will be fine.”</p>
<p>“That’s because you don’t know him that well.” Hennessey was extremely concerned.</p>
<p>“Like I said, I also want to meet Duke Skad. I will go by myself. The orders were probably for me to come alone anyways.”</p>
<p>Hennessey couldn’t hide his feelings of uneasiness, but he could not force her to stay. Loyalterre disappeared into the mansion and came out a short time later, dressed in formal wear for the meeting. As they drove away, he quickly sent a messenger to reach Michen as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Alexcent slowly looked over Loyalterre, as she sat in front of him drinking tea. She was definitely a Roden, as she gave no indication of being scared of him. He decided not to be diplomatic at all about his approach.</p>
<p>“So, you’re a bastard?” he said straight out.</p>
<p>Loyalterre flinched at his question and put down the tea. “Yes. How did you know?”</p>
<p>“There is nothing I don’t know in the Empire.”</p>
<p>Loyalterre’s eyes sparkled at Alexcent’s confidence. “It appears that you didn’t call me to you just to check whether I’m a bastard or not.”</p>
