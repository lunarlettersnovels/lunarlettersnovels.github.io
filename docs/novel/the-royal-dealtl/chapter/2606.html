            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 67</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst’s realizing that nothing would change, bowed her head despondently at Alexcent’s words. While Dajal stood their smug knowing, he had won.</p>
<p>“Gen,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness?”</p>
<p>“Take care of it,” he said in a low, deep voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir,” said Gen and bowed.</p>
<p>Gen made his way to the office door. He indicated for someone to come inside. They were the knights who had been standing outside, waiting for their master’s orders. They entered the office and bowed respectfully.</p>
<p>Amethyst looked at the knights nervously. <em>What is Alexcent thinking? Is he going to arrest me? </em>She looked at their faces and recognition dawned on her. It was Buerre and Riereia; she knew them! Alexcent nodded at them. A short, curt nod. Riereia from second division made his way towards Dajal and stood before him.</p>
<p>“Dajal Dusty,” he said, unsheathing his sword, “Any last words?” The metallic clink of the sword as it was pulled out of its scabbard made Amethyst apprehensive.</p>
<p>“What?!” said Dajal, shocked. His smirk disappeared from his face. He had thought victory was his. He looked at Prince Skad in surprise. “Your Highness!”</p>
<p>“Why are you so surprised, Dajal?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Your Highness!” said Dajal frantically, “It has already been established that this is false accusation!”</p>
<p>“This is truly disappointing,” said Alexcent, solemnly, “You think me a fool, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Your Highness!” said Dajal, “I would never….”</p>
<p>“I do not like repeating myself,” said Alexcent stonily, “So listen closely. First, all affairs related to the mansion falls under the authority of the lady of the house. So, if she wants to fire you, you will be fired. She has the authority and nobody, not even me, can disobey her.”</p>
<p>Dajal looked at him, stunned. Amethyst shared the same reaction. <em>It was that easy? I could have ordered him gone, and it would have been done? </em>She was lightheaded. She didn’t have to disguise herself to gather evidence. She realized that she had trusted no one. She had assumed that nobody would believe her unless she had enough evidence of his wrongdoings. And she obviously hadn’t trusted Alexcent enough to tell him. She sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>“If you think I have been unaware of your stealth, you’re wrong,” Alexcent continued, “I kept quiet to see how far you would go, that was the only mistake on my part. I let you be because you weren’t causing direct harm to me. But you have been found out, and I can no longer let this slide.”</p>
<p>“But I have served the Skad family for so long, I—,” trailed off Dajal, wilting under Alexcent’s piercing gaze.</p>
<p>“If you dare to interrupt me one more,” said Alexcent dangerously, “You will lose your tongue. Do not test my patience.” Dajal lowered his head and kept quiet.</p>
<p>“That’s more like it,” said Alexcent. “Now, even if Amethyst was dressed as a maid, it does not give you a right to touch her inappropriately. You have no right to treat a maid in such a manner. Besides, Amethyst might be dressed in rags for all she wanted. That would not change the fact that she is my wife. You offended her, looked down on her, lusted after her and laid your filthy hands on her. The punishment for that will be death.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness,” protested Dajal, and remembered Alexcent’s threat.</p>
<p>“In consideration of your generations’ long service to the Skad family, I will grant you a painless death,” said Alexcent, “That is the only extent of mercy I can show you.”</p>
<p>“You cannot do this without evidence!” cried Dajal.</p>
<p>“Ahhh,” Alexcent said, smiling coldly, “Evidence, you say.” He turned around and picked a document from a pile on his desk. “You were so diligent, so shrewd in hiding your tracks, weren’t you? So very smart on invoicing the estate. I am sure it is not a coincidence that the slush funds and leaking internal operating costs match the amount on your account. You fool. Did you know I own the Aran Bank?”</p>
<p>“That can’t be…,” stammered Dajal, stunned. He despaired at seeing no escape and begged. “Please, Your Highness, spare my life.”</p>
<p>“You told me you had committed a ‘heinous crime’. You offered your life at my feet, to do so as I pleased, didn’t you?” reminded Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Please, My lord!” pleaded Dajal, “My family has served you loyally. Please….”</p>
<p>“I do so hate repeating myself,” said Alexcent. He looked at Riereia. “Proceed.”</p>
<p><em>Aran Bank belongs to Alexcent? </em>Amethyst was dumbfounded. She had indeed wanted to expose the villainous monster and his deeds. But she had never really thought that he would be killed like this.</p>
<p>“Wait!” she shouted and stepped between Riereia and Dajal just as his blade lifted into the air. “You can’t kill him,” she said hurriedly, “He committed disgusting crimes worthy of death but you can’t.”</p>
<p>“Ma’am,” said Riereia awkwardly, lowering his blade to his side. Dajal, taking advantage of the situation as always, looked up at her with glistening eyes.</p>
<p>“Amethyst,” Alexcent called to her, his voice dangerously low. Amethyst would do well not to cross him.</p>
<p>She looked at him, straight in the face. “He has wronged me,” she said, “He is my prisoner. I get to decide what to do with him.” Alexcent narrowed his eyes at her. She looked at him, unwavering. “Death is just too lenient a punishment,” she added.</p>
