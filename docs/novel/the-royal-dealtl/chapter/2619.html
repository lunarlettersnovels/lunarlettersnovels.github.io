            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 54</strong></p>
<p>“Sir Dajal.”</p>
<p>As Roman bowed to formally greet him, Amethyst followed suit as well.</p>
<p>“Tsk, tsk, you better finish up by today. These days the lady of the house likes to come out to the garden.”</p>
<p><em>Hmm, that lady of the house is right here!</em></p>
<p><em>What an idiot that can’t even recognise the lady of the house! Do you have fish eyes? No, even fish eyes are a waste.</em></p>
<p>“Yes.” Roman bowed her head and answered.</p>
<p>Dajal clicked his tongue and turned his gaze to the one next to her. with a look that said ‘this is the first time I’ve seen this girl’.</p>
<p>As he looked at Amethyst with lustful eyes, she felt goosebumps. She simply bowed her head even further.</p>
<p>Dajal held his gaze as he spoke to Roman in an uninterested tone.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow the bedsheets in the knights’ dormitories need to be changed. You know what that means?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then hurry up and finish cleaning up. And you, are you new?”</p>
<p>“What? Oh yes.” Amethyst answered</p>
<p>“What was your name again?”</p>
<p>“Ca…rol.”</p>
<p>“Carol? It’s not a familiar name.”</p>
<p>“She came from the suburbs.” Roman answered in Amethyst’s stead.</p>
<p>“Is it… Well, I guess you’re here since I picked you as well. So pay close attention and remember what happens when you go against me.”</p>
<p>“— Yes.”</p>
<p>Amethyst answered through clenched teeth. She contemplated kicking his mouth but told herself to hold it in.</p>
<p><em>But what should I do… They say people hold back three times before committing murder…</em></p>
<p><em>I feel like I won’t be able to hold back the next time!</em></p>
<p>※</p>
<p>After that Dajal didn’t show up again. Every day Amethyst and Roman carried out an unbelievable amount of workload, and time flew by.</p>
<p>“Roman!”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Look at this.”</p>
<p>Amethyst lifted up her sleeves and flexed her arms. “Do you see that? Do you see that bulge in my biceps?”</p>
<p>“Pfft! Madam, even if we’re both women you must uphold your modesty.”</p>
<p><em>Really, our Madam is a true character. Even now, here, she is flashing her bare skin! Even though she is in one of the highest positions, she bows the lowest. She carried out difficult tasks even as she swore on, but is resilient.</em></p>
<p>“What are we doing today?”</p>
<p>“Today… a piece of new equipment has arrived. So we will clean the commodity warehouse—”</p>
<p>“We have a problem!”</p>
<p>A maid opened the door suddenly and ran in while shouting.</p>
<p>“Why what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Si-sir Dajal is looking for Carol… looking for Madam!”</p>
<p><em>Oh my, the time has finally arrived!</em></p>
<p>Roman stood up in surprise and looked at Amethyst. “Madam…!”</p>
<p>“I’m all right, don’t worry. In fact, it’s a good thing. But it took longer than I expected. I guess I’m not that charming.”</p>
<p>“Madam! No I should go along with you—”</p>
<p>“No. This is an opportunity. In fact, it might be the last…one.”</p>
<p>“But if the Prince finds out…!”</p>
<p>“Hmm… then it is a good thing….”</p>
<p>Even as she said that aloud., she couldn’t help worry. <em>Will he support me when the time comes?</em></p>
<p>There was no way he would believe her. She doubted that he would act out for his wife of one year. And they had only spent a month together so far so how could she win over a relationship of seven years?</p>
<p><em>Until I find solid proof I must do my utmost. </em>She told herself firmly but could feel her fingers turning cold.</p>
<p>Then, Amethyst smiled at Roman and left.</p>
<p>※</p>
<p>She stood outside a smaller building but that seemed to have no damages like the one she had come from. It seemed to be the space used by Dajal.</p>
<p><em>A space used by himself…</em></p>
<p>She felt her shoulders tense up.</p>
<p><em><strong>Knock, knock!</strong></em></p>
<p>She knocked before opening the door and entered the office. Surprisingly it was neat. The interior was modest and nothing appeared extravagant to the eyes.</p>
<p><em>Tsk, just how much money is he hiding? I bet this too is to trick others.</em></p>
<p>Then the balding man with his bulging tummy came into view.</p>
<p><em>But why is this man only dressed in a gown?</em></p>
<p>Even as these thoughts ran in her mind, due to the time she had spent with Roman she automatically bowed to greet him.</p>
<p>“You sent for me Sir Dajal?”</p>
<p>“Was it Carol?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“The girl I’ve been calling wasn’t to my liking….”</p>
<p><em>The girl he has been calling? He must have gotten sick of her!</em></p>
<p>“From today on I want you to be in charge of cleaning this place.</p>
<p>“— Yes.”</p>
<p><em>Ha! What to do?!</em></p>
<p>“Right now I would like you to clean the living room. The girl before wasn’t meticulous and I spotted many dusty areas.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly he’s pretty neat. Even though he looked like he would be dirty and messy.</p>
<p>Amethyst quickly went to grab a bucket of water and started to mop the place. Everytime she mopped her body moved, and Dajal stared at her from the sofa in the living room. His filthy gaze followed her around.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was due to the closed window, or from moving around, her body felt hot and she felt suffocated. Drops of sweat formed on her forehead, and the ribbon around her neck added onto the heat.</p>
<p>Amethyst loosened the ribbon around her neck. She could breathe a little better but she still felt warm. She could feel the sweat on her and the disgusting gaze that followed her.</p>
<p>By the time the living room was mopped, a fair bit of time had passed by. She held her hands tightly together out of nervousness. It was time to go back. If she was even slightly late, people would start looking for her. Also Alec would be returning.</p>
<p>“Erm, Sir Dajal… I have finished.”</p>
<p>Dajal slowly got up from the sofa and started to walk over to her side of the living room.</p>
<p><em>Gulp!</em> Amethyst swallowed hard</p>
<p>Dajal swiped a finger on the bookshelf she had last cleaned and looked around. Then he bent over and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>“It’s clean. I like it. Good work today, I will see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir Dajal.”</p>
<p>Amethyst tried to bow as politely as possible and left his office.</p>
<p><em>Yucks, that perverted bastard! My ear…I want to wash my ear! </em>Amethyst rubbed her ear in disgust. But soon she slowed down. <em>I’m sure Dajal is testing waters. I must be more careful from now on.</em></p>
<p>She quickly changed out and headed back to the main mansion. Even then, Alexcent had not yet returned.</p>
