            <p><strong>Chapter 172</strong></p>
<p>“Yes.” Barden was blushing. It appeared he had a secret to share but was also apprehensive to reveal it. Amethyst wasn’t sure how to proceed. He had said he wanted to meet her, so was this person he spoke of is someone close to her?</p>
<p>“Is the person you speak of someone related to me?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Barden looked around wildly to make sure no one had heard. His face was now a bright crimson.</p>
<p>Amethyst couldn’t think of who it would be. She thought of the possibilities – Lunia, Roman. But she had no idea where they would have met Barden.</p>
<p>“I can’t guess who it is,” Amethyst said, giving up.</p>
<p>“It’s someone close to you, but I’m not going to tell you who it is. I just wanted to meet you and the duke. That’s why I picked the family. So, will you pick up the sword? If it’s ok, I’d like to teach you a few techniques.”</p>
<p>“Sure! It’s not like there is anyone else here to teach me right now.”</p>
<p>“The knights are relieved for a rest period between the appointment ceremony and the welcoming ceremony,” Barden explained.</p>
<p>“Really? I didn’t know that.” Amethyst felt sorry that she wasn’t allowing Lunia to have a break. “Could I ask you to check my posture?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. The first thing I noticed, when I came in, is you raise your arms too high. It’s a weak defense and if your opponent it stronger, he will break through your block.” Barden corrected Amethyst’s form and then had her going through the various posture, correcting them one at a time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Lunia, go rest now!” Amethyst commanded.</p>
<p>“Pardon? What do you mean by rest?” Lunia wasn’t sure where this demand was coming from.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard it’s a rest period for the knights until the welcoming ceremony. Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>“Right now, I’m your assistant, not a knight.”</p>
<p>“You were a division commander before that!”</p>
<p>“That’s all right. I have nothing to do, anyways,” Lunia said.</p>
<p>“It’s not all right. It’s your vacation until the welcoming ceremony! Rest!”</p>
<p>“No. There’s a lot to prepare still, for the welcoming ceremony,” The servant protested.</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of all that, so don’t worry,” Amethyst assured her.</p>
<p>“Ma’am, how are you going to take care of all of it? You only have Roman as a maid. I don’t have to rest long. I’ll just relax for half a day.”</p>
<p>“No! Rest for at least five days,” Amethyst was insistent.</p>
<p>“I refuse!”</p>
<p>“Then, four days! I can’t do anything lower.” Amethyst couldn’t believe they were bargaining about relaxing.</p>
<p>“I’ll rest for a day. I can’t do more.” This had become a battle of wills, and Lunia was the stronger of the two.</p>
<p>“Really, Lunia? How could you? If anyone heard about this, they would curse me for being a bad employer!” Amethyst was clearly getting upset.</p>
<p>“Fine. I’ll think about it, if you look after all of my duties while I rest for four days.” Lunia knew that Amethyst hadn’t thought this through. She could see the look on Amethyst’s face as realization set in about how much Lunia actually does.</p>
<p>“Fine! I’ll… do it,” Amethyst said, with much trepidation.</p>
<p>“Ma’am, you’re planning on procrastinating and then giving it to me after four days, aren’t you?” Lunia knew Amethyst too well.</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed hesitantly. She had been caught. “No,” she lied.</p>
<p>“It’s harder to do it all after four days. From my perspective.” Lunia wanted to make her feel guilty.</p>
<p>“But the other knights are all resting.” Amethyst was out of excuses.</p>
<p>“Fine. I’ll rest for two days and come back.” Lunia could tell this wouldn’t end unless she compromised.</p>
<p>“Ok, two days!” Amethyst agreed.</p>
<p>After kicking Lumia out, Amethyst sat on the sofa and thought about the newly recruited knight, Barden.</p>
<p>Someone he like in the duke’s household? Someone close to her? Amethyst wondered who it was. Probably Lunia, who else was closer? Since both Lunia and Barden were, knights they could have met before. How much could a man sought after a woman that he would refuse the honour of being a royal guard and come here? It must be more than lust, it must be love. Amethyst let out a small giggle, thinking of this mystery.</p>
<p>“What’s so funny?” Amethyst jumped. Alexcent was peering down at her from over the back of the sofa.</p>
<p>“When did you come in?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“Just now. What were you thinking about so deeply that you didn’t notice me coming in?”</p>
<p>“That’s none…!” Amethyst looked at Alexcent with an interesting and surprising thought. <em>Why did I think it was only a woman that Barden could love? </em>Amethyst realized. <em>‘I just wanted to meet you and the duke. That’s why I picked the family,’ that’s what he said. Alec is the only one who’s the closest to me.</em> <em>Everything fits perfectly!</em> <em>It has to be Alec! Unfortunately for Barden, Alec isn’t gay.</em></p>
<p>For some reason, Amethyst felt sorry for Barden. If what she thought was true, she would be sad to see his heart break.</p>
