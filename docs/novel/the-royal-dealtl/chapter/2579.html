            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 93 – Duties of a Duchess</strong></p>
<p>It was a sunny day, serene and peaceful. But Amethyst felt far from it. After the incident at the training, things were a bit awkward between her and Alexcent. It wasn’t very obvious though that might be because she barely met him. She vaguely remembered in her drowsy state from sleep that Alexcent came to her night late in night. Then she fell asleep. She hadn’t met him in the morning again.</p>
<p>Amethyst sat at a dainty table at the garden, drinking tea. She saw Pon walking towards her. “Pon!” she called, “Just in time. I wanted to ask you something.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Ma’am,” he said, “Pease go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Is your original name really Pon?” she asked, distracted.</p>
<p>“No, Ma’am,” he said, “My full name is actually Forte.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” said Amethyst, “Why does everyone has such short names here? I notice that everyone’s name is cut short. Is there a reason for it?”</p>
<p>“Well, His Excellency had it shortened while addressing,” said Pon, “Since the names are long and time-consuming.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Amethyst, thinking, “Does that include Gen and Hill, and everyone else?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” he said.</p>
<p>“Then by any chance, does Alec call the Empress… Bell?” she asked, excited. Although, she didn’t recall Alec ever calling the Empress ‘Bell’.</p>
<p>“I am afraid not,” he said, “It would see rude to call the Empress in such a manner.” Pon hesitated. “But when His Excellency was younger, he would address the Empress as ‘Hey’”</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed. It was strange to think of Alec, young and naïve, calling his sister ‘Hey’.</p>
<p>Their conversation was halted by the brisk arrival of the servant, Lunia, “Madam,” she addressed Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Lunia,” said Amethyst, “Would you like a cup of tea?”</p>
<p>“No, Madam,” said Lunia, looking Solemn. “I am a little worried about Roman.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I think she is having trouble managing the separate house,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“In what manner?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“The employees there tend to underestimate her as the manager, since she formerly worked there as a maid,” she said, “She seems to be having a hard time controlling the workers.”</p>
<p>“When Dajal was in charge, he ruled with an iron fist,” said Lunia, “Nobody dared disobey.”</p>
<p>“Dajal used violence, he abused the workers,” said Amethyst firmly.</p>
<p>“I think more discipline is needed,” said Lunia, “Work isn’t getting completed because Roman’s authority is being undermined. Time is running out to prepare for the annual festival.”</p>
<p>“Annual Festival?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>Pon chose this moment to speak up, as though he had been waiting for a chance. “Yes, Madam,” said Pon,” There will be an annual festival soon enough. It is the reason I came to visit you. This is the extra budget added for the annual festival.” He handed her the document.</p>
<p>Amethyst took the document and looked at it. “What is the Annual Festival?” she asked.</p>
<p>Pon began to talk in detail. “The Empire’s parliament this year will soon be over. During the three months of the Congress’s reopening, aristocratic households are holding a meeting to gather their heritages. That’s the annual festival.”</p>
<p>“A meeting?”</p>
<p>“Yes, until a new parliament is launched, indirect and direct heritage of the family will gather to discuss about next year’s budget, taxes to collect, new projects to close, and will come to a consensus to submit them to the parliament next year. That’s how Congress restarts, discussing approval and distribution of subsidies for new projects, conducting audits on projects that ended, and discussing national events. Before the new parliament begins, the annual festival is needed for the aristocratic families to consult and receive the budget for next year. And the indirect heritage families will soon be arriving to participate in the annual festival.”</p>
<p>“And how long does this festival last?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>” It lasts about a month.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“And greeting the guests is the responsibility of the Duchess,” said Pon, “Which falls on you.”</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded. <em>The Annual Festival is a big fancy family reunion of a sort, then. All the skad family or relatives will be gathered, </em>she thought, <em>damn it, I guess being a Duchess has its disadvantages. I hate family reunions.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst also knew that that there were unfair expectations and responsibilities especially placed on women. The tables were prepared for a meal. The men in the family ate first, then the children and lastly, the women. Which was very unfair. Sitting at a table eating the cold leftovers. She wasn’t really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>The chores would be never-ending. Preparing food, setting the table, washing the dishes. Well, she deserved a rest before she dived into the work. And no matter how devotedly she accomplished it, a slight dissatisfaction would always be followed by nagging of ‘insincerity’ or being not very genuine for the families’ presence. Sigh.</p>
<p><em>Maybe the Skad family reunion will be different, </em>she hoped, <em>maybe it won’t be as brutal and ruthless as what I went through. Or maybe they are petty. What if I prepare it extravagantly and they blame me for being wasteful, or if I am a little resourceful, then they will blame me for not upholding the glory of the family. This is terrifying!</em></p>
<p>“Then prepare the festival same as last year,” suggested Amethyst.</p>
<p>“What?” said Pon, shocked, “But this is your first time introducing yourself to the family…”</p>
<p>“I’m sure nothing I do will be enough,” said Amethyst, “So it is better to just stick to whatever had been going on in these festivals. I also need to figure out this festival before I begin to prepare for it. So please prepare this year’s festival the same as last year. I will gather enough information to think of something for next year.”</p>
<p>“Really…would that be all right?” Pon asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amethyst firmly, “So please do as I say.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
