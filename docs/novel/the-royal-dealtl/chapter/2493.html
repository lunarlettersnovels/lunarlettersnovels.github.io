            <p><strong>Chapter 175</strong></p>
<p>“Barden, thanks again for the sword practice,” said Amethyst, “Thanks to you, I finally managed to correct my posture.”</p>
<p>“Pease don’t mention it,” said Barden, “You invited me to such a great dinner and gave me the opportunity to indulge in a duel with His Excellency. There is nothing that can be compared to what you have done for me.”</p>
<p>“It’s my way of repaying you for your help,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“It’s thanks to you that I have this honor. No everyone can dream of having a duel with the Lord,” said Barden, “It’s thanks to you that I get this opportunity!”</p>
<p><em>Barden sounds so happy, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>If I had known how happy this would make him, I would have helped sooner.</em></p>
<p>“Let’s have dinner together today as well!” offered Amethyst, walking at Barden’s side after swords practice.</p>
<p>“What? No, no, it’s okay!” said Barden hurriedly.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that he is your idol,” said Amethyst, “Let’s dine together today. You will get to meet him again.”</p>
<p>“No, no, really, it’s fine,” said Barden.</p>
<p>“Oh, come on!” insisted Amethyst, “I am fine with it. Just come.”</p>
<p><em>I don’t think Madam can become a knight one day, </em>thought Barden. Amethyst had a remarkably low ability to read the room. Knights are supposed to understand the situation by reading the tension and people around them.</p>
<p>She had failed to notice the way Alexcent had stared daggers at him, yesterday. Barden couldn’t help but think that she was just too clueless to be able to be a knight.</p>
<p>“No. It’s really alright. Yesterday was more than enough.” Barden politely declined.</p>
<p>“You need to keep seeing each other to get fond of one another.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think there is a need to grow fond of each other.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, don’t say that. I’m well aware of how you feel about…” Amethyst trailed off.</p>
<p>Barden realized that something was wrong then. And it was necessary that he correct it before things got worse. He stopped walking and turned to Amethyst.</p>
<p>“What do you mean you know how I feel?” asked Barden, confused.</p>
<p>“I am a pretty observant person,” said Amethyst. “You mentioned about the one you like.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand…” said Barden. He didn’t understand the relevance of him liking someone with the current conversation. He looked at Amethyst getting more and more confused.</p>
<p>“It’s Alec, isn’t it?” asked Amethyst, “The one you like.”</p>
<p>“What?!” He couldn’t tell if he had heard right.</p>
<p>“I am not that narrow-minded,” said Amethyst hurriedly, “I should have figured it out sooner…”</p>
<p>“Wait… wait a minute,” said Barden.</p>
<p>Barden took a deep breath. It was hard to keep up with her thoughts. <em>Is that why she was trying so hard to praise me to the duke? Was she trying to get me closer to…?</em></p>
<p>Barden turned to Amethyst. “I am sorry for the misunderstanding,” said Barden, “The person I like is Lady Lohikin, not the duke!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Alexcent signed the stack of documents, piled up next to him on the table, that Gen had brought in. He felt a strange presence. He set the documents aside and got up from his seat. <em>I definitely felt her there, but also someone whom I despise.</em></p>
<p>He walked to the office window and peered out. He saw that Barden and Amethyst were engaged in an intense conversation a few paces away from the front door of the mansion.</p>
<p><em>It’s him again. </em>Alexcent scowled.</p>
<p>Gen walked to where Alexcent was and followed his gaze outside wondering what had caused him to get up so abruptly in the middle of signing the documents. <em>Isn’t that Madam… and Barden Crayson? </em>He looked at Alexcent to see him scowling at the two. He sighed. <em>Seems like someone’s going to get it today. He is the heir of Marquis Crayson, so it will be troublesome if he dies. Wait… Barden Crayson!</em></p>
<p>He recalled running into Count Lohikin and Marquis Crayson in the corridor on their way to meet the empress.</p>
<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Gen. Gen belatedly realized he should have kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p>“What is it?” asked Alexcent. Nothing passed his notice.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing…,” said Gen.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t sound like ‘nothing’ to me,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Haha,” stammered Gen, “Truly, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>Seeing how Gen was adamant at avoiding his gaze and changing the subject, Alexcent cornered him. “Gen,” said Alexcent threateningly, “Tell me what it is.”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“Gen, I am in a very bad mood right now,” said Alexcent, “So, don’t irritate me more. For your own good.”</p>
<p>“It’s about Barden Crayson.”</p>
<p>“What about him?”</p>
<p>“He is the eldest son of Count Crayson.”</p>
<p>“So?” asked Alexcent, “I am really losing my patience here.”</p>
<p>“I believe that Madam had been engaged to someone else before she married you,” blurted Gen.</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p><em>Her previous fiancé… </em>Alexcent turned back to the window. Barden was looking at Amethyst earnestly as he spoke.</p>
<p>Even though Alexcent couldn’t hear what he was saying, he knew Barden had come to the mansion to meet Amethyst for sure. But why? To reclaim his fiancé? <em>Does Amethyst feel the same way? So that’s why…</em></p>
