            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 35 – A First (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p>The bedroom was filled with silence, the only audible sound was of their rough breathing. Alexcent kissed her tenderly on her forehead, and then turning her body over, made her lay on her front.</p>
<p>Amethyst opened her eyes wide and looked at him before speaking, her voice hoarse with longing. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“What do you think? You don’t expect me to be satisfied by just once, do you? No way, it’s our first night together,”Alexcent smirked and kissed her back. She started to tremble. His lips traced her spine to her ass and licked downwards. She shuddered as her senses were heightened once more.</p>
<p>Alexcent laughed as he opened up her thighs.</p>
<p>Once they had reached the early hours of the next day, Alexcent finally allowed her to rest in his arms.</p>
<p>More accurately, she had passed out in his arms.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>By the time she opened her eyes, it was already past noon.</p>
<p>“Ah….ouch!” She tried to get up but her whole body ached. All over, it felt like her body was screaming at her not to get up. As though having awaited her cries, a maid immediately knocked at the door and asked.</p>
<p>“Madam, should I prepare the bath?” They seemed to know exactly what a new bride needed after her first night.</p>
<p>“Yes, please.”</p>
<p>“We will come and escort you once it is ready.”</p>
<p>She didn’t have to wait for long. Soon the maids came to fetch her, and Amethyst followed them to the adjoined bathroom and into the bath. She felt much better as she dipped herself in the hot bath. Then one of the maids relayed the message from the Prince.</p>
<p>“He said you would be tired once you wake up and told us to serve you to the best of our abilities. He wanted us to inform you that he has gone to the palace to catch up on work that he had put off due to the wedding.”</p>
<p><em>Work that he had put off due to the wedding? What a lie. I did all the preparation for the wedding. And working all those late hours in his study wasn’t enough? I can’t barely lift a finger and yet he can already get to work. I don’t know if he just has good stamina or is a complete workaholic.</em></p>
<p>As she dipped herself in warm water, she felt her muscle ache easing away.</p>
<p>Then she saw the red love bites all over her body. She had only read about these…but to see them in real life was a very new experience.</p>
<p>So, it was real. These kinds of marks. I thought it was just a phrase.</p>
<p>Then it accidentally triggered the thoughts from the night before. For some reason, even though it wasn’t, yesterday felt like her first time. Every moment she shared with him last night felt like a dream. It was ecst@sy she had never experienced before. It was hard to resist him, when he hugged her gently, as though he truly loved her.</p>
<p><em>Ha. No. Let’s not think about it.</em></p>
<p>She shook her head and tried to drive away her thoughts.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p><em>What if the original owner of this body, Amethyst returns?</em></p>
<p>She felt guilty as she hadn’t been able to fight away her desires.  Weighed down by her guilt, she felt as though she had committed a mistake, entranced in her own desires.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Amethyst finally managed to collect herself and finished her bath. The maids immediately brought her a change of lingerie and a dress for her.</p>
<p>The l!ngerie was an all-in-one underwe@r, tightly lined with laces combined with a br@ and a waist nipper, making her feel like one of the models of the Victoria’s Secret show that she had seen on the Internet. (Words were censored in accordance to the advertiser’s policies. Thank you.)</p>
<p>She who had only ever worn hundred percent cotton underwear, touched the l!ngerie in awe. She wondered if it would be okay for her to wear something so soft and delicate.</p>
<p>Then her eyes fell on the tight corset and dress, and she frowned.</p>
<p>“Umm… I was hoping to wear something more comfortable than a dress. Something not as tight. And i also don’t need a corset.”</p>
<p>“But Madam. This is the only clothes that are ready/ The only comfortable dress is this thin evening dress ….”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll wear that.”</p>
<p>“Yes Madam but at least the undergarment….”</p>
<p>“Oh alright.”</p>
<p>Amethyst had never been a big fan of tight clothes. Whenever she got off work, she would wear a large boxy t-shirt and shorts over the whole weekend, so for her, the tight dresses were good enough to qualify as torture. When she was at home, she had never even worn a bra.</p>
<p>Amethyst carefully lifted up the lingerie. Then she cautiously wore the flower lacy lingerie and put on the evening dress.</p>
<p>It was a pale yellow cream coloured, simple and modern, high waist body dress. Then she put on an embroidered gown and covered herself.</p>
<p>She went to her bed and had just lied down, when a thought suddenly struck her, making her get out of bed. When she walked the lacy and silk gown moved along with her pace. She secretly liked the feeling of the silk sleeves around her wrist.</p>
<p>Amethyst’s destination was the Prince’s office.</p>
<p>Even though it was called an office, it was far grander than the public library nearby.</p>
<p>Books were tightly and concisely arranged. She looked around but couldn’t find any book to suit her interest. After much contemplation she picked a few books and returned to her room.</p>
<p>Once she returned, a maid asked.</p>
<p>“Madam, you’ve not eaten anything yet. Shall I prepare something and a pot of tea?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… now that you mention it, I am rather hungry. I’ll have it in the bedroom then.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
