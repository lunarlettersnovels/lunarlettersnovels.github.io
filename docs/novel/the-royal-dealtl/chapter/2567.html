            <p><strong>Chapter 105 – Misunderstandings</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst was fine with it either way so she nodded approval. The fluttering chiffon dress was chaste yet sexy with layers of frills and mesh laced around the neck, chest and shoulders. The green ribbon complimented the whole dress. It looked youthful yet classy that would suit someone young but in a position of power.</p>
<p>“I like it!” said Amethyst eagerly, “I don’t even need a corset with this one.” The dress was loose around the waist in a stylish fashion so nobody would even notice a corset.</p>
<p>“Madam, you still have to wear a corset,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“But why?” groaned Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Because it will complement your physique,” she said.</p>
<p>“Harsh,” whispered Amethyst.</p>
<p>Lunia’s tone became gentle. “I won’t tighten it all the way.” Amethyst smiled at her gratefully.</p>
<p>“Right,” said Lunia, “We move on to makeup and hair.”</p>
<p>“Since the mesh lace comes up to the neck,” said Roman, “An all-up hairdo would suit you greatly.”</p>
<p>“Roman, you are a genius!” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s nothing,” said Roman shyly, “I was just imagining it on Madam.”</p>
<p>So, it continued in this manner with Roman and Lunia showering and deflecting each other with compliments. Amethyst was amused. They both seemed a bit shy with each other. “Are you two very close?” said Amethyst, smiling, “Are you two perhaps in a relationship?”</p>
<p>“No!” said Lunia, hurriedly, “How do you figure that?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Roman at the same time.</p>
<p>“It is somehow suspicious that both of you are so very diligently denying it while blushing deep red,” smirked Amethyst. And indeed, both Roman and Lunia avoided each other’s eyes and looked flushed.</p>
<p>Lunia cleared her throat. “Apricot shade suits you, but a red lip would make quite the impression,” she continued.</p>
<p>Lunia applied red on Amethyst’ lips. “Indeed!” exclaimed Roman, “It looks very good on you, Madam.”</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve tried a red lipstick,” said Amethyst, doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Do you like it?” asked Lunia.</p>
<p>“Surprisingly, yes,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>*<br>
Amethyst, finally finished being dolled up, sat straight-backed on the chair without any support. The corset, despite Lunia promising to tie it loose, was still killing her. She was unable to bend even a little. <em>Damn the bloody corset, </em>she cursed.</p>
<p>“Madam, the Duke will be arriving shortly to escort you,” said a servant from the other side of the door.</p>
<p><em>Alec…, </em>she thought, her heart fluttering. She felt like she waited for ages and yet there was no knock at the bedroom door. Intrusive thoughts made a nest in her mind. One of those thoughts pricked her suggesting that maybe Alec had gone to escort Count Glacia to the feast. She shook her head trying to clear her thoughts.</p>
<p>Time went ticking, and yet he didn’t come. “The Duke must be running behind schedule, he will be here anytime now,” said Lunia, noticing Amethyst’ discomfort, “Anyway, the heroine always arrives fashionably late, so you needn’t worry.”</p>
<p>Amethyst let on a small smile to assure Lunia that she was alright. <em>But what if he went to the banquet hall already with Count Glacia, </em>she worried, <em>what do I do then? Should I just go by myself? I am capable enough.</em></p>
<p>Her heart wavered. She was anxious. Her empty stomach ached, she could taste bile in her mouth and the damned corset was killing her. She was just about to ask Lunia to loosen her corset a little when the bedroom door opened, and he walked into the room.</p>
<p>For someone who was late getting ready, he was in a very stylish outfit. He wore his best uniform but in a relaxed manner. His jacket was unbuttoned, his tie was nowhere near and a few upper buttons of his shirt were undone.</p>
<p>Alexcent certainly looked comfortable in his modest attire. It made Amethyst, who had spent half the day getting ready, feel like she had utterly wasted her time. <em>Well, his attire hardly seems like a reason for him taking so long to escort me, </em>she thought, <em>was he escorting Count Glacia to the banquet then?</em></p>
<p>She chided herself. She was well aware that Alexcent would never do that to her. He wasn’t that kind of person.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” said Alexcent, nonchalantly. His expression, unchanged.</p>
<p>His lack of reaction disappointed Amethyst. She hadn’t expected him to shower her with compliments or praise her, but she had, at the least, expected him to show some kind of reaction. <em>Well, just as well, </em>she thought, <em>I bet Count Glacia looks all dolled up and stunning.</em></p>
<p>She stood up and walked to the banquet hall being escorted by Alexcent. They didn’t speak. He seemed to be almost angry, judging by the thin line that his mouth had changed to. <em>This is outrageous, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>I should be the one who gets to be mad at you! </em>Firstly, he hadn’t even mentioned his relationship with Count Glacia to her. Also, he had been treating Amethyst very coldly after the arrival of Count Glacia. This was simply unfair.</p>
