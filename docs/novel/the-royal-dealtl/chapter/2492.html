            <p><strong>Chapter 176</strong></p>
<p>“My lord?” called Gen, cautiously.</p>
<p>Alexcent smiled and then laughed like a madman. Gen trembled looking at him. He felt that his lord had gone mad finally.</p>
<p><em>That was why she gave me her body but not her heart, </em>thought Alexcent. <em>She pushed me away because of him… </em>His smirk disappeared. He became cold once again. He was no longer her Alec. He was just her contractual husband whom she shared a contract with for a time. He could no longer be her Alexcent anymore even if they had shared passionate nights together.</p>
<p>“My lord,” said Gen hurriedly, “It was probably arranged by her parents. I did hear that Madam had declined it.”</p>
<p>No matter how hard Gen tried to repair the damage, Alexcent no longer heard him. Alexcent raised his hand in a gesture and Gen fell quiet. He saw down on his chair and continued with signing the documents.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amethyst was busy trying to understand what Barden had said. Lady Lohikin. So, was it her sister?</p>
<p>“Oh my!” exclaimed Amethyst, “My sister? Merril?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Barden, hesitantly. He blushed, proving her correct.</p>
<p>He had said it was someone close to me and he really wanted to see me. So, it was Merril all along. <em>This guy really omits important details…</em></p>
<p>“Barden?” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Barden.</p>
<p>“Do you often get misunderstood by the ones around you?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Oh… how did you know?” he asked.</p>
<p><em>Ha… just as I thought. </em>Amethyst stared at him. If he had explained to her in detail, she wouldn’t have done awkward stuffs.</p>
<p>“I guess…there is something wrong with me… like I thought.” Barden’s shoulders drooped.</p>
<p>“That is only because you never mentioned the subject in your speech!”</p>
<p>“Is… is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Didn’t you know? Wait…you didn’t do that to Merrill, did you?”</p>
<p>There was only silence. At her words, Barden’s face crumbled. He really looked all gloomy. <em>What should I do with this guy?</em></p>
<p>“Did she reject you?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“No!” said Barden.</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>“I’ve not confessed yet…..”</p>
<p>Amethyst sighed and turned to the door. Ignoring it seemed the best thing to do right now. She was about to enter through the front door when Barden caught her.</p>
<p>“Please don’t misunderstand.”</p>
<p>“About what?” Amethyst asked indifferently. Unlike earlier, where she had felt sorry for him and empathized with him, her heart had now turned cold.</p>
<p>“It’s not because I wanted to be in your good books,” said Barden, “I just wanted to get together with Lady Merril no matter what…and I wanted help…but that’s not why I came to the mansion.”</p>
<p><em>I am pretty sure it is, </em>thought Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Lady Merril often talks about you.”</p>
<p>“About me?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She said that she respected you for never giving up despite your weak body….”</p>
<p><em>Oh no, I have no memory of the past that I might have shared with Merril. What should I do? Amethyst worried.</em></p>
<p>“I’m not really sure how my sister saw me.”</p>
<p>“She mentioned how you never gave up and constantly tried to take care of your appearance… And that she is proud to have a sister with a high self-esteem who she will always emulate…”</p>
<p><em>Isn’t that more of a curse than a compliment? </em>thought Amethyst. Momentarily, the image of Merrill smiling at her across the dining table back in the Lohikin mansion flashed by. The sparkling eyes that looked up to her were honest without lies. Her smile was warm, too.</p>
<p>“Which is why I’ve always wanted to meet you,” said Barden.</p>
<p>“Well, now we’ve met.” Amethyst tried to turn around again.</p>
<p>“Then do you think you could help me a little…”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“I mean…with what I’ve mentioned before.”</p>
<p>Amethyst tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you ask if I’m often misunderstood by others?”</p>
<p>“Well that’s because you don’t…”</p>
<p>“I had no idea. Until you told me.”</p>
<p>“Then tell me what exactly you want my help with. See you’re forgetting the most important subject, again.”</p>
<p>“Ah! I’m sorry.” Barden struggled to say something, but he was unable to continue.</p>
<p>Out of frustration, Amethyst spoke up, “If you are going to ask me to help you to get together with my sister then I’m afraid I can’t help you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no! That wasn’t what I… I am well aware of my shortfalls and that I will never be good enough for Lady Lohikin. I’m not trying to ask for such a thing…”</p>
<p>“No, no. It is not because I find you to be not good enough. I may be Merrill’s sister but I can’t agree to help you without knowing how Merrill feels. What’s most important, after all, is her feelings.”</p>
<p>Barden’s face fell again. Like a lost child. <em>Oh, if I wasn’t weak on such expressions. No, if only Barden wasn’t a pure handsome man, then I wouldn’t have been so weak-hearted.</em></p>
<p>“Fine!” said Amethyst, “For now I’ll teach you how to start a conversation with a Lady without being misunderstood. Will that do?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Of course. Thank you for that!” Overjoyed, Barden hugged Amethyst.</p>
<p>At that moment, somebody shouted. It was Lunia. She ran towards them and grabbed Barden by the collar and pulled him away. Lunia had so much strength that she yanked him a few paces away. <em>Wow, I heard she used to be a knight. I guess she didn’t become a division leader for nothing. I shouldn’t mess with her.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst was so happy to see her friend back after such a long time. “Lunia!” she exclaimed, “Are you back already? I missed you so much.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am back,” said Lunia, “But more important than that, what are you doing here like this?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” asked Amethyst, confused.</p>
