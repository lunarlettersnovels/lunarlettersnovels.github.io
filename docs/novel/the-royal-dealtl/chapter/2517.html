            <p><strong>Chapter 151</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst looked up at him as he gazed at her. His soft, platinum blond hair was dripping wet, and his red eyes were full of desire. His hands entrapped her on either side. His body pressed her to the wall. And Amethyst felt desire stir within her.</p>
<p>“Really,” said Alexcent, “what should I do with you?”</p>
<p>He unzipped her dress and pulled at it. She lifted her arms so that he could pull it off. With a thud, the soaked dress fell to the floor. The water dripped down his chest. Even though she had seen him like this almost every day, it still felt like she was seeing him for the first time. Her heart raced.</p>
<p>She felt like an idiot and felt afraid that this moment would soon disappear. She wanted to freeze time. Her hands reacted of their own accord. She placed her right hand on his heart and felt his heartbeat. She brought her left hand up to his lips and caressed them. She slowly looked up at him. His red eyes gleamed through his platinum blond hair which dripped with water and fell into his eyes.</p>
<p>Alexcent tasted her fingers on his tongue. She had waited for this every night. She took her hands from his lips. But Alexcent grabbed her hands and kissed her palm and licked her fingers. She could feel his wet, hot tongue on her fingertips. He kissed her wrist, her inner arms and then her collarbone. His lips dropped down to her chest. He sucked her there tearing a gasp out of her.</p>
<p>He pushed her against the wall and kissed her chest, nibbled at her. His lips trailed down to her waist. Her mound swelled from his constant teasing. “A-Alec,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>His lips trailed down to her thigh; he was crouching now. He lifted one of her legs and draped it across his shoulders and kissed her on her most private parts. She felt his tongue exploring her, sucking her. She squirmed.</p>
<p>“Alec… ahhh,” she moaned.</p>
<p>Instinctively, she grabbed his hair and pulled him closer. He invaded her insides and continued tasting her, tickling and sucking her. Every time he moved his tongue, it set her on fire. He teased the most sensitive areas tearing moans from her lips. Sometimes, he would kiss her gently as though he was afraid he might break her, while other times he sucked so roughly that she couldn’t take it anymore.</p>
<p>His tongues moving inside her set her afire and she moaned. Soon he found the bulge and licked it and sucked it so hard that her legs gave away as a hot liquid poured out of her. Alexcent held her body aloft.</p>
<p>“Not yet, Ash,” he whispered, “We are far from done.”</p>
<p>“Mmm,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>Alexcent took her hands and placed them around his neck. He took her legs and placed it around his waist and slid his member inside her. She closed her eyes, satisfied with the feeling of him inside her. He moved vigorously as though he had never touched her before. The water ran down their intertwined bodies as he thrust inside her. Soon, with the sound of the water and skin on skin, their loud moans filled the room.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Amethyst opened her eyes. She realized that something was different. The ceiling was different. She realized that she wasn’t in her bed. <em>Oh my! This is… Alec’s room, </em>she thought. She sat up and looked around. It felt unusual to be waking up in his room.</p>
<p>The bathroom door was wide open. The floor was wet, and the towels were thrown haphazardly on the floor. Alec’s room was usually so neat and organized that the objects in the room scattered around the floor felt very weird to see.</p>
<p><em>We were so excited yesterday that… </em>She blushed and looked around guiltily. She felt his arm on her thigh. He was still sleeping peacefully. <em>He must have been so tired. </em>Alexcent was always the first to get up in the morning. Amethyst was not a morning person and had never ever gotten up before him, except today. <em>Of course, he must be. Fighting a beast for over ten days… It feels nice to see him sleeping like this.</em></p>
<p>She touched his eyelashes gingerly, afraid she might wake him up. “Don’t just look at me like that,” he said suddenly, “Why don’t you give me a morning kiss, at the least?”</p>
<p>“Did I wake you?” said Amethyst, leaning back. “I am so sorry.”</p>
<p>“Hm,” he mumbled.</p>
<p>Alexcent sat up and stretched a little. He then looked around at the state of his room. “What a sight,” he said, “Well, in my defense it was uncontrollable.” He smirked.</p>
<p>“Alec…”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“My clothes…” Amethyst spoke. “They’re all wet. What do I do now?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“This is your bedroom. I need to go back to my room, but I can’t go back stark naked.” She explained.</p>
<p>“Then you can just to stay here.” Alec said with a smug smile.</p>
<p>“Alec, I can’t stay here forever.”</p>
<p>“Then we can ask someone to bring your clothes,” the duke suggesting asking a staff.</p>
<p>“No!” Amethyst declined profusely.</p>
<p>“What do you mean no?”</p>
<p>“It’s embarrassing!” Amethyst exclaimed. He looked at her, unable to understand. “I mean, if it was my room, it would be okay. But how can I ask someone to bring it to your room? It’s embarrassing.”</p>
<p>“What’s there to be embarrassed about?”</p>
<p>“You might not be shy about it but I am.” It was widely known that he entered her room after they got married, but not her.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to hear the rumors… that the Madam couldn’t hold herself back any longer and went into the duke’s room and slept there. She could already imagine the gossip going around amongst the employees.</p>
<p>No matter what, she had to return to her room without getting caught.</p>
<p>“Then what shall we do?”</p>
<p>“That…I’m not too sure.”</p>
