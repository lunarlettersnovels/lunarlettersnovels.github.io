            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 89</strong></p>
<p>“How?” she asked, glaring at him. <em>It was supposed to be a secret between me and him, </em>thought Amethyst, helplessly. <em>Why didn’t he tell me?</em></p>
<p>“Gen was the one who introduced you to me,” he said, “He told me that you were the right person for it.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was stunned. <em>No wonder he came to me at the ball, </em>she thought, <em>He knew I would agree to it because Gen told him so. And here I was, blabbering about ‘love’. How stupid can I be? I wish I could punch him right in his head!</em></p>
<p>“I see,” said Amethyst, coldly.</p>
<p>Gen shrugged. “Doesn’t matter,” he said, “What matters now is how we reply to the nobles.”</p>
<p>“Well, Ash isn’t wrong,” he said, “Just tell them I was stupid and made some flares for the sake of romance, for my beloved wife. Everybody marries for love. They don’t have to know the whole truth.”</p>
<p>“What?!” snapped Gen. “And what if that doesn’t work?”</p>
<p>“Then I guess it will be a time for real war,” he said, smirking.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency!” exclaimed Gen wanting to wipe the smirk off his face. Many thoughts raged in his head. <em>If it came to war, they would possibly win. But war was still fruitless and bloody. Perhaps for now I will just say that the Duke was so in love with his wife that he did it as a display of affection and pray it sways them.</em></p>
<p>Gen sighed and pinched the middle of his forehead in exasperation. “Okay,” he said, “I will send the telegrams explaining the situation. I will also inform the newspapers on it. I will drop by at the palace and clarify the situation.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please do,” he said, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Gen turned to leave. “I will leave you two to it then.”</p>
<p>“Gen,” called Alexcent. He turned. “No forgiveness next time.”</p>
<p>Gen bowed. “Understood, Sir.” He left the room to prepare telegrams to be sent.</p>
<p>Amethyst was confused about Alexcent’s last words, then she remembered that it was a warning to Gen for entering her bedroom without her permission. Well, that wasn’t going to sway her from the things he had clearly hidden from her.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell me?!” she snapped.</p>
<p>“About what?” Alexcent asked, appearing sheepish.</p>
<p>“Don’t act like you don’t know,” she said, “Gen knows about the contract. And I made a fool of myself thinking he didn’t. And about the attack magic.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t ask,” replied Alexcent curtly.</p>
<p>“Oh, how convenient for you!” she shot back, “Gen arranged everything for you, including me and you excuse yourself from the fact you didn’t mention it to me because I didn’t ask! Who else knows?”</p>
<p>“No one,” he said.</p>
<p>“Well, isn’t that a relief!” she said sarcastically and turned away from him.</p>
<p><em>Aww, she is angry now, </em>he thought. He approached her and wrapped her in his arms from behind, his chin above her head. “I am sorry,” he said softly, “Should I make a flower for you this time as a token of my apology?”</p>
<p>“Are those possible?” she said, excitedly and remembered that she was supposed to be angry at him. “That still doesn’t mean I am not angry at you.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” he said, “anything is possible, if it is for you.” He flicked his fingers and fiery flowers lit up the sky.</p>
<p>“Do animals!” she yelped, “Maybe a rabbit, or a lion.”</p>
<p>He lit the sky with whatever she wanted to see. Amethyst cheered in his arms. There was distant voice shouting ‘Your Excellency!’, but soon it was buried by the explosion and cheers from Amethyst.</p>
<p>Gen hurried over to the messengers after leaving Amethyst’s chamber. He quickly wrote the responses and had the messengers carry it to the different estates. “Please deliver them, respectfully,” he instructed them.</p>
<p>Gen made his way to the carriage which was ready to take him to the palace. There were newer explosions lighting up the sky.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency! Please!” he shouted at the Duke and Amethyst who were still there at the balcony. Either they couldn’t hear her, or they were pointedly ignoring her. Gen sighed. He entered the carriage and indicated for the driver to start. He will have to hurry. Everybody in the palace might be waiting for a clarification.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next day, all the headlines in the newspapers jarringly announced that the Duke Skad had overnight become the kingdom’s most romantic person. Gen sighed, relieved but still stressed over the events that led to this:</p>
<p>[Duke Skad, creating the one and only serenade for his loved one! Embroidered the night sky for his beloved wife]</p>
<p>[The absolute way how this man shows love. He will fight till the end for you!]</p>
<p>[According to a close aide to the Duchess, the nights are all reserved for her husband…]</p>
<p>[Quite an event in the middle of the night! Duke Skad turns out to be the biggest romantic.]</p>
<p>[The cold-blooded Duke Skad, turns out to be the warmest lover to his wife]</p>
<p>[Now call me the master of events! The Duchess’s number one fan— Duke Skad!]</p>
