            <p><strong>Chapter 179</strong></p>
<p>Lunia, who was emptying another glass of ale, looked quite happy to be a knight today, instead of someone’s personal aide. Meanwhile Buer had jumped on top of a table and was chugging straight from a barrel of wine. From below the knights were cheering him on.</p>
<p>Beside her, Alexcent observed Amethyst watching the knights. He admired how her white skin contrasted with the black dress she was wearing. Her scent wafted over him, and because they weren’t alone, it made him impatient. Even at this moment, he felt himself lust for her and it was difficult to act as though it was not affecting him. Which was why he continued to drink out of frustration.</p>
<p>Amethyst was starting to get worried as she watched him down glass after glass, so when he refilled, she reached out to grab his arm.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you drinking a little too much, too fast?” she asked as she tried to take away his glass. With a loud smack, Alexcent instinctively slapped her hand away. Her eyes widened at the clear rejection.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” Embarrassed, Amethyst apologized immediately. Amethyst felt upset seeing him act with such disdain. <em>Just a while ago he was kissing me and now, he won’t even let me lay a hand on him, </em>she thought. <em> I really can’t understand him.</em> Her eyes began to tear up. She couldn’t cry in front of all the knights. She needed to distract herself.</p>
<p>The knights must have made a wager as they compared their abs next to Buer and cheered each other on. It was an amusing sight, but Amethyst could not laugh. Her mood had reached its lowest point.</p>
<p>“I think it’s best if you go back,” Alexcent said without looking at her.</p>
<p>“Sorry?” She hadn’t realized he was speaking to her at first.</p>
<p>“Go back to your room.”</p>
<p>“But the ceremony isn’t over yet,” she pleaded.</p>
<p>“Do you really want to stay and watch a strip show?” Alexcent asked.</p>
<p>“No!” Amethyst realized the knight’s drinking was causing their actions to get out of hand.</p>
<p>“Then go.” It was clear that Alexcent had no inclination to leave with her.</p>
<p>Amethyst stood from her seat and looked one last time at the party. Lunia was quite drunk by this point and was egging the other knights on. It was clear she would be leaving alone. She wanted to ask Alexcent to come with her, to return to her room and be with her, but she was afraid she would just be rejected once more.</p>
<p><em>I think it’s true that you become weak when you love someone, </em>she thought as she left. <em>I’d never suffered this heartbreak from him before. Now I place meaning in all of his words and actions. How saddening is that? </em>She was aware that everything Alexcent did was an act. The kissing, the wiping sauce from her mouth, it was all to hide the fact that they were in a contract marriage.</p>
<p>She was really alone. As she walked the corridor, she felt tears gather.</p>
<p>Stopping at one of the large bay windows, she looked up at the night sky. The crescent moon illuminated the glistening droplets rolling down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Are you going back already?” The soft voice addressed her and she quickly wiped the moisture from her face. Turning, she faced Barden standing in the corridor behind her.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m tired and wanted to get some rest. What about you Barden?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really like these kinds of events, so I’ve escaped.”</p>
<p>“More like you don’t like drinking,” Amethyst corrected him.</p>
<p>“You’re absolutely right.” Barden smiled, then noticed her red eyes. “Why have you been crying?”</p>
<p>“I’m not crying, I’m just…” The tears she had been trying to hold back burst forth by Barden’s concern. He walked up to Amethyst and embraced her.</p>
<p>“If I recall correctly, you told me I should always lend my shoulder if I see a woman crying,” Barden said, gently.</p>
<p>“That’s only applicable to the person you love. Not someone like me,” Amethyst sobbed into his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Why does that matter? There is no decent man that would ignore a damsel in distress.”</p>
<p>Amethyst wiped her tears. “Thank you. I needed to be comforted by someone.”</p>
<p>“Those tears, are they because of the duke?” Barden asked.</p>
<p>Amethyst felt speechless. She couldn’t bring herself to answer Barden’s question.</p>
<p>“Well…that is…” As she searched for an answer, there was a sudden movement from behind her and Barden crumpled to the floor. They were both so engrossed in the conversation that neither had sensed the approach of the figure behind them, or the fist that flew through the air, connecting with Barden’s jaw.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I said you should steal her back and all you’re doing is chasing her away.” Gen, who had been seated next to Alexcent, commented on Amethyst’s quick exit from the hall.</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Alexcent replied in anger, gulping down another glass of ale. All he could picture was Amethyst laughing at the other men. And then there was that smile towards Barden. It made him furious. He even kissed her in front of that man to prove that Amethyst was his. <em>I have never been like this. Why do I resent her? </em>he thought.</p>
<p>Leaving Gen, he followed Amethyst from the room. In the glow of the moonlight being cast on the castle hall, he witnessed the silhouette of two lovers in an embrace. As they separated, he saw Amethyst smile. He lost all of his senses. With an uncontrolled aggression, he launched himself at the man, his fist flying through the air. Barden crumpled to the ground and Amethyst was on him, holding him back from continuing his assault.</p>
<p>“Let go!” Alexcent tried to shake her off.</p>
<p>“Alec! Stop! What are you doing?” Amethyst cried as she struggled with her husband. Barden lay on the ground, moaning with a cut on his lip.</p>
<p>“What am I doing? What are you doing? Why were you hugging Barden?” Alexcent was enraged.</p>
<p>Amethyst didn’t know what to say. She couldn’t tell him how upset she was about his treatment of her, or that Barden was simply comforting her. She couldn’t possibly say these things out loud. But her silence just infuriated Alexcent more.</p>
<p>Alexcent shook Amethyst off and grabbed hold of Barden. Barden clinched his eyes shut as Alexcent lifted his arm to punch him again.</p>
<p>“Alec, please don’t!” Amethyst quickly wrapped her arms around Alec and begged for the man to stop. She couldn’t control her emotions and her tears erupted once more with a wail.</p>
<p>“Are you crying because of him right now?” Alexcent couldn’t believe what he was seeing.</p>
<p>“No! It’s not like that!” Amethyst pleaded.</p>
<p>“No? You’re crying because of him, so what do you mean it’s not like that?” The duke yelled.He released his grip on Barden and ran his fingers through his hair, managing to restrain himself.</p>
<p>“Alec…” Seeing her desperate eyes he gave in.</p>
<p>“F*ck.” He turned and disappeared down the corridor.</p>
<p>Amethyst knelt beside Barden, who was lying on the floor. “Are you alright?” she asked, helping him up.</p>
