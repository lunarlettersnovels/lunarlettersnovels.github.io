            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 15 – By Hook or by Crook (1)</strong></p>
<p><em>‘Was that the right way to phrase it? Why did this guy appear out of the blue and ask me for a dance? Is something wrong with his eyesight? There are way prettier girls out here. Just from his looks, he looks like he has sky-high standards. Or did he have a preference? How peculiar!’</em></p>
<p>Amethyst was overwhelmed, at first by the extravagant party she was attending, and now by the proposed dancing. She wasn’t confident of her dancing skills and tried to avert the impending humiliation by politely declining the duke’s proposal.</p>
<p>However, if a young lady from a noble family couldn’t dance, it would be the talk of the town. Her already delicate relationship with Count Lohikin, her supposed father, would be under unnecessary stress; she didn’t want to humiliate the household any further.</p>
<p><em><strong>‘Is that what your parents taught you?’</strong></em></p>
<p>Perhaps she was hearing things, but she thought she heard a familiar voice, her mother in law’s whenever she taunted her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, dizziness took over her.</p>
<p><em>‘I am not Kim Heeyeon. Amethyst. I am Amethyst Lohikin</em>.’</p>
<p>Amethyst shook her head, her heart beating fast and her face pale.</p>
<p>Looking at the panicking Amethyst, the duke thought to himself.</p>
<p>‘<em>Well I guess she doesn’t stutter.’</em></p>
<p>He wasn’t one to give up just because he was rejected. “Well. If that’s how you feel Miss Lohikin. Shall we go for a walk? You don’t look very well at the moment.”</p>
<p>The duke’s voice was just as great as his looks. Deep and low, it made you want to listen to it over and over again, until you fell asleep with the warmth and comfort it made you feel.</p>
<p>His voice drove away the self-doubting voices in her head.</p>
<p><em>‘Would it be too rude to refuse him once more?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Wait, Duke Skad…? Oh, I remember now.’</em></p>
<p>The royal family that Froy mentioned. The same hair as the emperor, the red eyes. He was the emperor’s one and only brother.</p>
<p><em>Oh my! Why did I only realise it now? It would be unpardonable if I gave him the wrong impression.</em></p>
<p>As the duke hadn’t withdrawn his invitation, Amethyst decided she needed some fresh air and nodded before replying. “If you’re fine with taking someone like me… I’m curious as to what the palace looks like. I would be honoured.”</p>
<p>“Then let me escort you, this way.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>The duke offered her his hand and Amethyst hesitantly placed hers on top of his. She could feel the coldness of the duke’s hand even though they were wearing gloves. He smiled and led her out of the banquet ball and towards the garden. As they passed the crowd, deep sighs were heard, and some young ladies even fainted.</p>
<p>Belice was the only person in the hall who was glad at the sight of the two.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The garden in the Belecian palace, though not as large or grand as the one in the imperial palace, was surrounded by well-grown trees and flowers that swayed in the wind showing off their unique colours.</p>
<p>The elegant figures of a man and woman walked down the flower trail in the darkness. Amethyst inhaled deeply the fresh scent of roses. With the fancy Belecian palace in the background she felt refreshed and much better.</p>
<p>Past the flower trail she could hear the sound of water running, and soon they were standing by a small marble fountain.</p>
<p>With water splashing in the background, Amethyst looked at the duke and asked boldly.</p>
<p>“Duke Skad, do you have something you wish to say?”</p>
<p>She was quick to read a situation after eleven years of living with her in laws. She was not a self-deluded; out of the many beautiful young ladies, he had approached her and engaged her in a conversation without a moment’s hesitation. She was not special in her appearance so it could only mean that he had business with either her or her family.</p>
<p>The duke stopped walking and looked at Amethyst. “Seems like you’re not slow. Good it’ll make things easier.”</p>
<p>“Duke Skad? You sound rather rude…..”</p>
<p>“Does that upset you?”</p>
<p>“No, of course not.” Amethyst lifted the fan in her hand and covered her mouth as though she was laughing.</p>
<p>The sudden change of his attitude had caught her off guard. Nevertheless, she pretended to be unaffected since he was of a higher rank, a duke, at that, even though she was churning with annoyance on the inside.</p>
<p><em>‘Look at this fellow ! I’m obviously older than you! He has no manners at all!’ </em>Nonetheless, Amethyst tried to act naturally and smiled.</p>
<p>“I’ll send a carriage to your place tomorrow. Take that and come over.” Alexcent announced to her in a monotonous voice.</p>
<p>“To where?”</p>
<p>“You’ll know soon enough.”</p>
<p>“What? No, what is this…”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean why?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p><em>‘What was he going on about out of the blue? Go where? This guy is pretty reckless in contrast with how he looks. And he sure knows how to piss me off!’</em></p>
<p>Amethyst, a strong character herself, had promised herself that, in this world, she would live without being suppressed by others and do only what she wanted.</p>
<p>She huffed in barely restrained irritation.</p>
<p>“Unbelievable! Duke Skad, I think you’re mistaken. I’m not someone who you can order around. How could you be so rude to someone you’ve just met? If you need to see me then you should be the one to come over! Well, excuse me.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t be bothered to hear a reply. Amethyst making her point, retraced her steps and exited the garden.</p>
<p>Going back to the banquet hall would only draw attention, she decided, it would be better to go home. What a pity that she couldn’t taste all the food!</p>
