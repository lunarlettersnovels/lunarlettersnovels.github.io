            <p><strong>Chapter 137</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst chuckled. “I mean if you were a thief, would you find it logical to steal one or two valuables from a number of them so that it won’t be very noticeable?” said Amethyst, “Or would you steal a brooch and a necklace from someone who would notice it instantly?”</p>
<p>“That… it…,” stuttered Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“If you want to weigh the worth of the jewelry,” continued Amethyst, “I am sure the jewelry Alec gifted me can’t be compared to what you currently have. He recently gifted me an entire shop’s worth of jewels and accessories which I haven’t even had the chance to open and keep track of—”</p>
<p>“Lady Skad!” exclaimed Count Glacia, “What is it that you are trying to say?”</p>
<p>“I am here to warn you,” said Amethyst, “If you ever raise a hand to the people in this mansion who work under me, I will not sit back and watch. This time, I am letting it go but I hope there will not be a repeated occurrence of such behavior. I am sure you are very smart, and you are able to understand and remember this.”</p>
<p>Amethyst glared at the count and the count glared back at her. Neither of them seemed willing to budge. Surprisingly, it was Count Glacia who relented after a while.</p>
<p>“I will, Lady Skad,” said Count Glacia. She knew that she shouldn’t cross the line, especially not in the presence of Lunia, who was once the duke’s aide.</p>
<p>“I am glad you understand,” said Amethyst, “I am thankful for your time.” She directed a comforting smile at the count and turned to leave. Lunia hurried ahead to open the door for Amethyst.</p>
<p>Count Glacia was filled with rage. She flung the vase on the table which shattered against the wall in a thousand tiny pieces. The beautiful flowers fell on the carpet. Count Glacia stomped on them reducing them to a mess. She believed she could destroy any flower she liked, but her belief was challenged today. Amethyst seemed more like a weed, unbreakable. At this state, she would lose everything if she didn’t find a solution. She tried to calm herself and contemplated her options.</p>
<p>“Count…” said her maid cautiously.</p>
<p>“I need to repack for the hunting match,” said count Glacia.</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“A dress!” said count Glacia, “The dress that I didn’t wear for the ball would be good.”</p>
<p>Count Glacia had previously bought a very beautiful dress especially for the ball. She had chosen the other red one to embarrass Lady Skad and left the dress untouched.</p>
<p>“Of course, count,” said the maid.</p>
<p>“This will be my last chance,” said Count Glacia, “We need to prepare thoroughly for the hunting match.”</p>
<p>“Understood,” said her maid, and hurriedly left to make the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p>Count Glacia thought that if she couldn’t break the flower, she will have to ruin it so that the butterfly would never seek it out. Never. Perhaps if a new better flower was by the butterfly’s side, it would relent and give in to the wiles of the flower one day.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Habe followed Amethyst closely as they left the count’s room. “Madam,” she said, “Thank you so much. Thank you for believing in me, I will never—”</p>
<p>“I think you have misunderstood something, Habe,” said Amethyst, “I never said I have forgiven you.”</p>
<p>Habe looked frightened. She silently followed Amethyst to her room. The duchess sat on the sofa. Habe stood in front of her anxiously while Lunia stood next to where Amethyst was seated, awaiting her decision. At a short distance, Roman stood silently with the other maids.</p>
<p>“Lunia?” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam?” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“At times like this, what is the most suitable punishment?” asked Amethyst, pressing her temples as though the whole affair was causing her a bad headache.</p>
<p>“The most suitable punishment would be dismissal, madam,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>Habe looked downright miserable. “Please madam!” she got down on her knees and pleaded, “Give me another chance. I will never disappoint you again. Please, I beg of you!”</p>
<p>Hearing Habe plead didn’t make Amethyst feel too good. “I see,” said Amethyst, “I will terminate Habe’s contract.”</p>
<p>“Madam, please,” sobbed Habe.</p>
<p>Lunia was taken aback. “Sorry?” she asked. Amethyst had never taken a drastic measure as dismissing an employee before. She had assumed Amethyst would either suspend or cut some percentage of pay for Habe.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong with that?” asked Amethyst, looking at Lunia.</p>
<p>“Not at all, madam,” said Lunia hurriedly.</p>
<p>“Dismissing you on the spot would be unfair,” said Amethyst to Habe, “So I will give you three months. Habe, you should find a suitable job within these three months. After which, I would like you to leave this mansion.” Amethyst turned to Lunia. “Lunia, have a retirement fund prepared for Habe’s years of service, and until the duration of the festival, pick another maid.”</p>
<p>“Understood, madam,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>Amethyst looked at Habe still on her knees. “Habe, I would like you do go back and work in the side buildings and stop working in the main mansion.”</p>
<p>“Please madam!” pleaded Habe, miserably, “Please forgive me this once.”</p>
<p>Amethyst sighed. “Habe, please get up from there,” she said to the maid still on her knees, “Doing this won’t change anything. You have to take responsibility for your actions. You should have thought about this when you bargained with the count. I am already giving you a chance by not having you dismissed immediately.”</p>
