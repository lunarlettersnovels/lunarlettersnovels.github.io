            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 7 – A Doting Father (2)</strong></p>
<p>The next day with Yellie’s help, Amethyst was able to reach the dining room on time. As usual, the Lohikin couple was already there and waiting.</p>
<p>“Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” She answered with a smile.</p>
<p>She had already sat down in her chair, when recalling yesterday’s conversation with the Count, she stood up and approached the couple, awkwardly kissing each of them on the cheek and sat back down in her chair.</p>
<p><em>‘Wow, I can feel my two cheeks burning up.’</em></p>
<p>Next, Matin ran into the dining room, kissed the both of them and quickly rushed to his seat.</p>
<p>“Matin, what did I say about running in the dining room?” The Countess gently reprimanded Matin and turned to the Count. “Darling, you should tell him off firmly sometimes.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“He won’t listen to me anymore.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll do that.”</p>
<p>Count Lohikin and Matin both exchanged a look and shrugged their shoulders.</p>
<p>Merrild was the last to be seated, and breakfast began; today, there was a fresh salad topped with roasted meat, clear soup and soft bread.</p>
<p>While eating the meat from her salad, Amethyst listened in on the conversation between the Count and the Countess.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that you were going to work today for the loan approval case?”</p>
<p><em><strong>Work</strong></em>? Interested, Amethyst discreetly gave rapt attention to the information being exchanged in the table.</p>
<p>“Oh, right. Yes. I will go in the morning.”</p>
<p>“If there’s a lot of work just hire more people.”</p>
<p>“Even so, the loan approval case is up to me since I am the final approver.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I suppose you are right.”</p>
<p>“Fortunately, there isn’t much this week. It’s just difficult to review that’s all.”</p>
<p>“If you are tired, I can help you a little…”</p>
<p>“No, that’s alright. You’re busy as it is. Even after leaving the palace you still have a stack load of work to catch up on in your office.”</p>
<p>“Well that’s true but…”</p>
<p><em>‘This must be a dual-income household, I gather.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Since Countess Lohikin mentioned that she is the final approver, she must be someone of oimportant role. Speaking of loans, maybe…she is the head of a bank?’</em></p>
<p>Last night, Count Lohikin mentioned official documents and now they’re referring to the palace as his place of work. So, he must be working for the nation, and her mother seemed to own a bank.</p>
<p>It was no doubt that Amethyst was born with a silver spoon.</p>
<p>In the time that Amethyst had been here, the count and countess seemed to be an ideal couple, affectionate and respectful towards each other and to their children. Even after years of marriage, the count paid his wife the attention she deserved.</p>
<p>This made Amethyst mull about her marriage in her past life… Suddenly, she heard her husband’s voice once again.</p>
<p>‘<em>What difference does it make, whether you know or not?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Just give it to me when I ask for it. Why are you being so nosy and trying to know everything?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘You should be able to deal with things on your own. Do I have to tell you everything?’</em></p>
<p>…those condescending and dismissive tones, how her opinion never seemed to matter at all, she shuddered at the reminder.</p>
<p>The Lohikin’s marriage was the exact opposite of hers; full of genuine respect and affection for each other. This was advantageous from Amethyst’ perspectives. Belonging to a privileged family of high social standing, no man would be able to disrespect or ill-treat her.</p>
<p><em>‘The real twenty-year old Amethyst would never even realize what a boon that is!’</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A few days later, Amethyst was able to meet the tutor and liberal arts teacher she had requested of her father.</p>
<p>He was young and slim, looking more like a good-looking engineering university student, than a liberal arts tutor.</p>
<p>“Hello, Miss Lohikin. I am Froy.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>Amethyst still struggled to adopt her new identity at times; since she was unable to introduce herself as Heeyeon, the way she used to, she skipped the introduction altogether.</p>
<p>Even though this was rude behaviour, Froy didn’t seem to mind.</p>
<p>“I heard from the Count that you wanted to learn more about the world?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Froy’s eyes gleamed with interest as he considered her. “You truly are different from the other ladies.”</p>
<p>“Is…is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It is not a common thought amongst young noble ladies.”</p>
<p>“I have a very curious personality.”</p>
<p>“I see. So, what are you curious about the world? I will do my best to teach you everything I know.”</p>
<p><em>‘Phew. What a relief he is not the prying sort!’</em></p>
<p>“I’d like to know more about the empire.”</p>
<p>“The empire… I’m sure you already know about its history, but I suppose we should start there. The Sehar Empire is a nation formed under the blessing of the Goddess Frostin. The goddess shined a light on the world which was full of darkness….”</p>
<p>“No, not that kind of vain history.”</p>
<p>This remark of hers elicited an extraordinary response from him; his eyes widened as he burst out laughing, clearly surprised and amused. After what seemed like eternity to Amethyst, his laughter subsided and he spoke, wiping a tear from his eye.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear God. Vain? Please don’t say something like that elsewhere. You will be arrested for insulting divinity.”</p>
<p>Amethyst’s face flushed red with embarrassment. “Noted.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Then besides its vain history what else are you curious about in the empire?”</p>
<p>Amethyst</p>
<p>decided to cut beating around the bush and blurted out, “In the empire is it a must to get married?”</p>
