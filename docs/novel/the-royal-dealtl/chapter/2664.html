            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 9 – The Bloody Duke (2)</strong></p>
<p>In the Sehar Empire, by the blessing of the goddess, a princess would always be born as an only daughter once every few decades. This princess would then be crowned. As such, there were no blood baths for succession, the country was stable and hence, had potential to develop into a great empire, achieving a peaceful era even until today.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, after a female heir to the throne was born, a male would be born but as soon as the princess was crowned the emperor, he would depart from the palace. And while being treated as an imperial family member, he would stay in a position that served to aid the emperor.</p>
<p>Even such cases were rare so there were very few people with platinum hair and red eyes which was the traits of the royal family.</p>
<p>The previous Emperor was the only one in history, since the founding of the Sehar empire, to give birth to fraternal twins.</p>
<p>Belice became the current emperor and ruled the empire at the age of twenty-one. As for the Prince Alexcent, he took over the title of the 22nd Duke of and later on, became the 23rd Duke <em>and</em> Prince of Skad.</p>
<p>Empress Belice had a bigger dilemma than her government affairs. Her one and only younger brother was now being referred to as the “blood duke.” He seemed to have no plans of getting married and was absorbed only in his work.</p>
<p>The duke was famously known not only within the empire but even in other nations, as a work addict. If one of the two families that support the Sehar Empire collapsed or the successor disappeared, it wasn’t just the emperor that was in danger. The entire Sehar Empire could be shaken up.</p>
<p>In a way the duke’s marriage was more important than the emperor’s.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Empress Belice, who had been signing the documents piled up in the office, asked Karune, her first secretary standing in front of her.</p>
<p>“Hmm…any news from that side?”</p>
<p>“No, your majesty. As you know he is rather stubborn. If he was one to follow orders, he would never have caused us this predicament in the first place.”</p>
<p>Belice frowned as she passed the approved document to Karune.</p>
<p>“I wonder if he has any sense in that wooden head of his. I guess this means I have to step in.” Belice’s forehead creased, thinking of ways to make her insolent brother bend to her will, “Fine I will invite all the young ladies of the noble families to this year’s commemoration party for the completion of the Belicean Palace. Of course, internally, it will be the search for the duke’s fiancée.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness. I accept your command.”</p>
<p>The Belicean Palace was a separate palace built to commemorate Belice’s ascension as the empress. It was built over a period of over eight years and was nearing its completion. It was also the place where Belice and her fiancé, Duke of Roden, would celebrate their coming union.</p>
<p>Karune quietly exited the office, holding a freshly signed copy of the payment document signed by the Empress.</p>
<p><em>Her Highness seemed perturbed, probably because of the duke’s delayed marriage; well, it was a legitimate cause for concern.</em></p>
<p>After Karune left, Belice, now alone, rubbed her tired eyes and muttered to herself. “I swear I’ve aged ten years because of you, Alexcent. I won’t be surprised to find grey hair next.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Gen, the assistant to the Duke of Skad stood erect in attention in front of him, holding files full of documents. Despite it being late in the night, the duke’s study was warm from the ember flames still ablaze in the fireplace.</p>
<p>Alexcent scanned the paperworks with his reddish black eyes set in a perfectly featured face, with his short platinum hair ruffled and unkempt.</p>
<p>Despite the luxurious warmth in the place, Gen felt like he was standing in the middle of a frozen road. Cautiously, he opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>“The palace has sent an urgent message.”</p>
<p>“And I’m sure it’s regarding the same topic.”</p>
<p>“Yes. That is correct. Would you like to reply?”</p>
<p>“Give it to me.”</p>
<p>On the document Gen presented, was the stamp of the world tree, the emblem of the empress.</p>
<p>The duke snatched it from Gen’s hand’s and without a moment’s hesitation, tossed it into the blazing flames of the fireplace. Accompanied by the crackling sounds, the Emperor’s letter fluttered into flames and were soon turned into ashes.</p>
<p>“Your Highness!” Aghast, Gen spoke before he could control himself.</p>
<p>The duke looked up with an eyebrow raised, as if to remind him not to cross the line and continued to read his documents as usual.</p>
<p>“I will handle the reply on my own. Isn’t it about time to give up? How persistent she is! I wonder what Duke Roden sees in this stubborn person.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness. Even if you are siblings, she is the Empress. Such words are a display of disloyalty.” While Gen reprimanded him, the Duke of Skad merely shrugged his shoulders, probably not even listening to him.</p>
<p>His devil-may-care ways frustrated him. While fulfilling a part of his responsibilities, Alexcent completely ignored other more important ones.</p>
<p>Feeling uneasy, as this was already the 58thletter from her sister, Gen decided then that he must do something about it; he couldn’t avoid the empress’s orders much longer and he would rather trick the duke into marriage than face Belice’s wrath.</p>
<p>As he paused from his paperwork to think of a solution, Gen suggested an idea, testing him.</p>
<p>“If it’s a marriage you dislike, why don’t you have a contract marriage?”</p>
<p>“A contract?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and just see through with the marriage. Put out the urgent fire first before…”</p>
<p>Even before Gen could finish his sentence the duke spoke. “Find one.”</p>
