            <p><strong>Chapter 128 (Rated 18)</strong></p>
<p>He wished he could push away count Glacia who was clinging so close to him. Momentarily distracted, he heard a soft groan escape from Amethyst’s lips. His eyes snapped back to her.</p>
<p>Alexcent couldn’t decide whether it was resentment or passion raging inside him. <em>Just who the hell are you moaning for? </em>He disliked everything at that instant. The meeting, this night, the alcohol, even her. She was decked from head to toe in a very sensual dress that she wouldn’t even bother to touch under normal circumstances. <em>Where the hell did she find a dress like that? </em>He would have very much wanted to tear it off of her, if only…</p>
<p>His pupils widened as she crossed her left leg over the other, part of her legs exposed. He couldn’t think anything anymore. His rational sense had abandoned him. He couldn’t think. It all happened in a flash. He downed the drink in one gulp, placed his glass on the table and stood up. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her up.</p>
<p>“Excuse us,” he said. “Come with me,” he said to Amethyst. Her skin was warm. He walked out of the office pulling her with him, a bit too roughly.</p>
<p>“Alec,” she said, “Wait…”</p>
<p>He didn’t let go. He walked down the corridor. His hand gripped her wrist so roughly. But her protests only made him walk faster. She stumbled in her heels.</p>
<p>“Alec, please,” she said, “My feet…”</p>
<p>He made no response. He seemed to not hear her. <em>I wonder if he has gone mad, </em>she thought. <em>Is he very angry? I was only trying to get him to pay attention to me. </em>Amethyst’s eyes welled up. <em>I don’t want to face him when he is this angry and I don’t want to be alone in my bed anymore.</em></p>
<p>She tried to shake off his hand. But his grip was like steel. She yanked her hand. Alexcent grabbed her waist and pushed her roughly against the wall. Then his mouth found hers. His tongue explored her mouth. His lips were hot on hers. A low, satisfied moan escaped Alexcent’s lips. It felt like her lips on his quenched all his unending thirsts. His heart thumped in his chest.</p>
<p>“Alec…,” she mumbled. His one hand, which was on her face, slid down tracing her neck, her collarbone, down to her chest. Amethyst felt a moan escape her.</p>
<p>She wanted to speak but his frantic kiss left no room for words. She gasped for air. She uncurled her hands from his hair and pushed lightly against his shoulders. “W-wait…”</p>
<p>He reluctantly pulled away. “Why?” he said, hoarsely, “Are you going to deny that you were trying to seduce me?”</p>
<p>Amethyst looked up at him. His red eyes glistened, full of hunger and desire. She was comforted by that look of longing. “I am not denying anything,” she said, “I was definitely trying to seduce you.”</p>
<p>Alexcent’s lips curled into a smile. “Well, it worked,” he said as his hands fumbled with her dress, trying to untie it.</p>
<p>“No!” she said, sharply. She grabbed his hands, stopping them.</p>
<p>Alexcent looked puzzled. “Why? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Not here,” she said, “Not in the corridor! What if someone—”</p>
<p>He lifted her in his arms, impatiently. Amethyst instinctively grabbed his shoulders. It was so amusing to Alexcent that she had seduced him and when he had finally given in, she was worried they were in the corridor.</p>
<p>“Alec!” she protested, “I can walk on my own.”</p>
<p>“Not fast enough,” he said, “With those heels.”</p>
<p><em>Well, why were you dragging me so hard just a moment ago? </em>Amethyst thought and smiled. He walked briskly. Amethyst raised her hands from his shoulders and wrapped it around his neck. She leaned on his chest.</p>
<p>“Ash, I am walking as fast as I can, damn it,” he said, “Don’t do anything more.”</p>
<p>Amethyst smirked. She raised her head and placed a kiss on his neck. “Ash…,” he whispered.</p>
<p>She nibbled at the nape of his neck and bit it, leaving a mark. She would leave a mark so that everybody knew he was hers.</p>
<p>Alexcent groaned. He finally reached the door of her bedroom and flung them open. He placed her down and closed the door. She pushed her against the wall and kissed her. Amethyst wrapped her legs around his waist, and he hoisted her up.</p>
<p>“Now, Alec,” she whispered, “Please, hurry.”</p>
<p>Alexcent was surprised. She had never allowed him to touch her before except when on their bed. She urged him on and Alexcent was happy to oblige. His hand slid down and pulled her dress up and touch her. <em>As always, she doesn’t wear anything underneath! </em>He felt the thread of his reason break and he pushed her harder against the wall and bit her on her neck.</p>
<p>Amethyst moaned. The shock of it was so great. She no longer had heels on her feet. He licked her neck trying to soothe the sharp pain of his bite.</p>
<p>“Alec…,” Amethyst couldn’t hold back her screams of pleasure anymore. It was a given that it would be heard down the corridor if anybody passed by. Alexcent noticed that the restrain she usually showed was gone, he didn’t mind that a bit. She was wild today.</p>
<p>Amethyst took hold of his shirt and tore it open. The buttons scattered on the floor. His bare chest was exposed, and she stroked it. She caressed his nipples which were hard.</p>
<p>Alexcent moaned. He shuddered. He grabbed her chin and kissed her passionately, exploring her mouth with his tongue, unable to hold it in any longer. The kiss became frantic. Amethyst’s hand slid down from his chest to his waist. She unbuckled his belt and unbuttoned his pants. She caressed the warm bulge between his legs. She stroked it.</p>
<p>“Ash…,” he mumbled at her neck. His hot breath tickling her.</p>
<p>She felt satisfied with his disorientation, but she wanted more. She squeezed his bulge and felt him tremble. She squeezed him harder. She slid her hands inside his cloth and found bare skin. Alexcent moaned and gasped. She stroked it and it became harder. She began to tease him, gently stroking it and caressing him like he usually caressed her. She was enjoying initiating this and she was definitely relishing the small sounds Alexcent made.</p>
<p>As though he couldn’t take it any longer, he banged his hand on the wall. He grabbed her hands and pinned them above her head, holding her in place.</p>
<p>“Ash…,” he barely managed to speak, “No more games.” He then lifter her and thrust inside her.</p>
<p>Amethyst gasped. She buried her head into his shoulder as a sharp pain accompanied the pleasure. Her body trembled. “Are you alright? Do you want me to stop?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, please,” said Amethyst, “Don’t stop now!”</p>
<p>He let out a breath and gently began moving his hips in a rhythm. Amethyst’s body thumped against the wall. Recalling their longing and the culmination reaching this one moment, they held each other hungrily. As he thrust inside her, Amethyst left crimson scratches on his back.</p>
<p>Alexcent carried her to the sofa. He was ever so gently thrusting inside her, afraid to cause her pain, but his desire burned within him even more. He lifted her up and placed her on the table beside the sofa. She lifted her leg higher and placed them on his shoulders, so he could move more freely.</p>
<p>Her consideration undid him. His thrusts began to get rigorous and harder and both of them gasped for breath. Their moans were testament to the pleasure they felt. The distance had made them even more passionate. The pleasure came in waves and disoriented them. The sound echoed off the walls of their rooms, the bathroom and even the corridor outside.</p>
