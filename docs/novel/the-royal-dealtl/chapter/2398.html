            <p><strong>Chapter 270</strong></p>
<p>She was deep in a dream when she felt like someone was tickling her bare skin. Amethyst half opened her eyes and looked into the face of the person who was caressing her body. The red eyes and the blonde hair of the man lying next to her glowed softly in the light of the dawn.</p>
<p>“Alec?” she said, still half asleep. “You woke me up.” There was some light laughter beside her. She rolled over into his arms. “It’s not time to wake up yet, right?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s sleep a little more.”</p>
<p>“We can’t,” Alexcent said, pulling the sheets off of her.</p>
<p>“Why?” Amethyst shivered as the cool morning air rose goosebumps on her skin.</p>
<p>“There is someone waiting to see you,” Alexcent replied. Amethyst couldn’t think of anyone who would be here this early. “You look curious.”</p>
<p>“Very.”</p>
<p>“Well, I have no intention of letting you go yet. They can wait.” Alexcent grabbed Amethyst as he rolled over, trapping her beneath him. Then he began kissing the soft skin on the side of her neck. She started feeling the ecstasy once more, but she pushed it from her mind as there was something important she needed to know before she got lost in his arms again.</p>
<p>“Wait,” she said breathlessly, pushing him away from her.</p>
<p>“Why?” Alexcent asked, looking dejected.</p>
<p>“I have something to ask you.”</p>
<p>“I think it’ll be better if you don’t.” Alexcent said mischievously, as he pulled her on top of him.</p>
<p>“Alec.” Amethyst was stern, trying to show this was important.</p>
<p>“Fine. What are you curious about?” He asked as he caressed her back with his fingers.</p>
<p>“First. Why were you made a slave? That is, if you and Gray were really the same person.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I was that damn slave. The one you kept pushing away.” Alexcent smiled. She thought he might have been mad for being made to work so hard, but he seemed all right.</p>
<p>“Tell me, then. Why did you become that slave? Did you have a fight with Belice?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then, why?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember that I had someone still to kill?”</p>
<p>Amethyst searched her memory. She thought he had killed everyone, be then remembered there was one person he struggled with killing. Amethyst began to feel uneasy.</p>
<p>“The High Priest?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. I killed him.”</p>
<p>Amethyst stood up and stared at Alexcent. He had struggled with killing the High Priest, so why did he do it? Was it because of her?</p>
<p>“Did you kill him because of me?” she asked, trembling slightly.</p>
<p>“No. But, there was a reason to kill him. He wasn’t someone I could kill easily, and the result was me becoming a slave. It was the least amount of punishment Belice could give out.”</p>
<p>“Are you all right?” It was a stupid question. No one could kill someone else and not feel guilty. Even if it was someone who deserved it. But she did feel badly for Alexcent and how he must be struggling in his heart. “I mean, I hope you don’t feel uncomfortable about it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t,” Alexcent said, quelling her concern.</p>
<p>Amethyst laid back down beside him and leaned her head against his chest. What he had done meant the dangerous existence of what could split them apart was now gone.</p>
<p>“Ash?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“You don’t like me killing someone?”</p>
<p>“Not that. It’s just that something like this couldn’t have happened in the world I used to live in. Not without severe consequences, at least. To kill someone so easily, it is considered evil. But this place is completely different, and it is hard to accept that you can kill someone so easily.”</p>
<p>“But you’ll have to accept it. That’s the way this world is. It’s to kill or be killed.” Alexcent said sternly.</p>
<p>“That means, you’ll have to keep doing it?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Alexcent accepted the fact so easily.</p>
<p>“Why?” Amethyst just couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>“I was born to kill.” Alexcent looked straight into her eyes. “The empress has to show a strong will and that requires being cruel sometimes. The personalities we were born with are aggressive in nature.”</p>
<p>“But you said Belice isn’t aggressive.”</p>
<p>“Yes. She hesitates when she has to be strong and cruel. That could be see as a weakness to the nobles. Weakness is a good reason for them to turn on her.”</p>
<p>“Belice certainly didn’t look cruel,” Amethyst said. “She seemed to me to be a confident and great leader.”</p>
<p>“On the outside, yes. But she’s too weak on the inside. But me, on the other hand…”</p>
<p>“You were raised to be aggressive.” Amethyst could see now. He was the protector of the empress.</p>
<p>“Yes, so I have to do the things that Belice can’t sometimes. I hope you don’t…” Alexcent looked away in shame.</p>
<p>Amethyst knew what it was that he didn’t say. But she certainly didn’t look at him as if he was a monster. “I understand. I just don’t want you getting hurt. Your body or your soul.”</p>
<p>“That won’t happen,” Alexcent said confidently.</p>
<p>“I trust you.” Alexcent put his hand on the side of her chin as she expressed her belief in him. He lowered his head and kissed her on the lips. He caressed her short hair. She could feel him tense a little.</p>
<p>“You don’t like it?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“It’s not that. I just miss it a little.” Alexcent said.</p>
<p>“Well, don’t worry. I’m growing it back out.” Amethyst brushed a hand across her head. “I thought I’d have to care less about it, when it was short, but it’s the opposite. It won’t style the way I want it to.”</p>
<p>“Do whatever you feel is best,” Alexcent said as he kept playing with hair, unsure of what to do with it.</p>
