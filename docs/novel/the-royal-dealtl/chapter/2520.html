            <p><strong>Chapter 148</strong></p>
<p><em>Oh dear, </em>thought Gen, <em>even for a fighter as formidable as the duke, fighting the Velacerovs alone with bare hands would be too much.</em></p>
<p>The duke was fighting the beasts with brute force without using any attack magic. Gen knew that using magic for the fight would render the purpose of the hunting match useless. This was done to warn the nobles of the power he held over them not about the magic he wielded.</p>
<p>“My Lord!” cried Gen and threw down the sword he held down the canyon.</p>
<p>Alexcent looked up at Gen’s voice. He released his grip around the Velacerov’s horns, stepped on its head and caught the sword.</p>
<p>“Just in time,” he said. He had gifted the sword to Amethyst who had returned it to him once more. It brought a smile to his face. <em>Welcome, </em>he greeted the sword.</p>
<p>A red glow emanated from the sword. It settled firmly into his grip. A thrill went through him. With the sword in his hands, he ran towards the Velacerovs. When the barbaric butchering of the beast began, some heads of the households averted their eyes or completely turned away from the scene.</p>
<p>Alexcent was overcome by bloodlust. It was difficult to distinguish which was human and which was the actual beast. He had such bloodthirst in his eyes that even the Velacerovs looked pitiful in front of him.</p>
<p>The duke leapt up from the canyon and stood before them, blood dripping to the floor. All the heads of the households bowed their heads and greeted him. Everyone was more polite and gracious to him than they had been before. Count Glacia was no exception.</p>
<p>Gen observed the scene. Seeing how Count Glacia made no inclination to approach Alexecnt like she did every time, Gen assumed something must have happened last night. <em>Something has changed, </em>thought Gen to himself, <em>the atmosphere is different than before.</em></p>
<p>Alexcent walked towards Gen. “How is she?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I escorted her safely to the mansion,” said Gen, “I have something to give you.”</p>
<p>Alexcent nodded. “Let’s call it a day,” he declared.</p>
<p>Everyone let out a sigh of relief at his declaration. Everyone had suffered in agony at the sight of blood drenched Alexcent and the stench of the dead beast. Alexcent grabbed the reins of his horse and slowly walked to his tent. Gen made his way into Alexcent’s tent after a while to find him showered, clean and calm.</p>
<p>“Madam told me to pass this to you,” said Gen, extending the envelope.</p>
<p>“Ash?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Gen, “I will take my leave. Please rest.”</p>
<p>Alexcent carefully opened the envelope after Gen had left. It had a letter and a paper card inside. He unfolded the letter, which read:</p>
<p>[Alec, I simply thought it was purely just a hunting competition, so I couldn’t understand why you were so adamant at not letting me attend. You could have explained things to me. I’m so sorry for being stubborn and not listening to your warnings.</p>
<p>I’m reflecting sincerely, so please don’t be angry anymore and be careful not to get hurt and return safely to me.]</p>
<p>The paper card was the compliment board that she had given him. It now had ten stamps. He had never received a letter of apology like this before.</p>
<p><em>A handwritten letter… how adorable! </em>Alexcent thought, with a smile.</p>
<p>The way she had written his name moved him. It felt like he could hear her voice through the letter. He sighed in contentment. He didn’t want anyone to see him like this, so content and happy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Roman!” called Amethyst.</p>
<p>Now that she had rested and gained her energy, she intended to take on her responsibilities with gusto.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>
<p>“Since Lunia is not around, I will need all your help this time.”</p>
<p>“Of course, madam,” said Roman sadly.</p>
<p>Amethyst knew how she felt. She took Roman’s hands in her own. “Don’t worry,” she said, “I will do whatever it takes to get Lunia back. But before we do that, we need to wrap up the festival before the duke gets back.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Madam,” said Roman, “I will do my best to help you with anything you need.”</p>
<p>“Great!” said Amethyst, “Call Pon for me.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said Roman.</p>
<p>She came back with Pon. She instructed them to arrange things to wrap up the annual festival. “Then Pon, please go ahead and prepare it as I have instructed,” she said, “We need every hand on deck since we don’t have enough time to do it at our leisure.”</p>
<p>“Understood, madam,” said Pon and bowed.</p>
<p>“Roman,” said Amethyst, “When you are finished helping Pon, please inform the ladies.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said Roman.</p>
<p>The mansion’s garden was bustling with people and movement. Everyone was busy. The merchants came and went and the maids in the household were busy moving and carrying things around to fulfill Amethyst’s instructions.</p>
<p>A large tent was set up in the middle of the garden and a preparation for the campfire was made in front of the tent. To one side, chairs and tables were set up. The preparation was finished successfully and on time because everyone contributed to the work that needed to be done.</p>
