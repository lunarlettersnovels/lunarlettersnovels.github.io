            <p><strong>Chapter 152</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent smiled and got out of bed.</p>
<p>“Wh-where are you going?”</p>
<p>Without answering her question, Alexcent entered his dressing room.</p>
<p>“Alec, you’re not going to get dressed and leave me behind, will you?!” Amethyst wrapped the bedsheet around herself and followed him to his dressing room, anxious at his silence. “Alec!”</p>
<p>He had already put on his pants and shirts, and was amid tucking it in.</p>
<p>“I just need to move you to your room without anyone knowing right?”</p>
<p><em>Move? Am I some kind of object? </em>But his suggestion caught her interest.</p>
<p>“…Ca-can you do that?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Without skipping a beat, Alexcent walked towards her in large strides and lifted her into his arms.</p>
<p>“Kyah!”</p>
<p>“Shh! Be quiet. I thought you’d be embarrassed if you get caught?”</p>
<p>Afraid that she would fall out, she wrapped her arms around his neck. He then started to move towards the door and out into the corridor. In case anyone recognized her, she buried her face in his chest.</p>
<p><em>Does she really think no one would be able to recognize her? Who else would I carry in my arms but her? </em>Alexcent wondered to himself. Then, he started to take the few steps towards her room.</p>
<p>Just then, Count Glacia came out of her room, one located next to his majesty’s. She seemed surprised, but as Alexcent placed a finger to his lips to signal her to be quiet, she nodded shortly and stayed in the same spot.</p>
<p>Alexcent leisurely opened Amethyst’s door and entered her room.</p>
<p>“Who was that just now?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I thought I heard someone…”</p>
<p>“There wasn’t anybody.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Alexcent carefully placed Amethyst on the bed. “Now, are you happy?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Thank you,” She flushed a little.</p>
<p>“Now rest.”</p>
<p>“What about you? You told them to take a rest until today.”</p>
<p>“I need to get ready to wrap things up.” The annual festival would come to an end once the hunting competition ended. It meant that the head of the household would be leaving soon, so he had to get ready for that.</p>
<p>“Ah! Don’t overdo it.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>As Alexcent was about to get up from the bed, Amethyst grabbed a hold of his arm. “Alec, about Lunia…”</p>
<p><em>Oh my, I almost forgot.</em></p>
<p>“Ah, Lunia is probably waiting for you to get up.”</p>
<p>“What? Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I told her to return last night.”</p>
<p>“…huh?” Amethyst’s eyes widened and she was busy thinking in her head. <em>Last night? When? When we were doing </em>that<em>?</em></p>
<p>Alexcent laughed lightly. “I don’t know what you’re thinking, but while you were asleep, I went to my office for a bit. Don’t have any weird thoughts.”</p>
<p>Alexcent gently grabbed Amethyst’s cheeks. “Then, I’ll really be off.”</p>
<p>“…Alec, thank you,” as she thanked him, Alexcent stroked her hair then left.</p>
<p>As soon as he left, Amethyst quickly went to her dress room and wore her undergarments. Then she lay back in her bed as though she had slept in her room from the start. Her preparation was perfect.</p>
<p>Then Amethyst called for Lunia.</p>
<p>However, Amethyst forgot that she had left her soaked dress on Alec’s bathroom floor.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>With the other household heads having been busy getting ready to go back, they only appeared on the last day. Carriages were lined up at the mansion’s entrance, ready to depart. Amethyst stood next to Alec as they got ready to bid them farewell.</p>
<p>The first to say goodbye was Count Glacia, the lady coming forward to say goodbye to Alec and Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Thank you for everything.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Good job.”</p>
<p>As Alexcent accepted Count Glacia’s greeting, she approached Amethyst to say her goodbyes as well.</p>
<p>“Lady Skad, thank you for everything so far. If I have upset you in any way, please forgive me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. There was nothing like that.” Amethyst was relieved that she wouldn’t have to see her again, and so she decided to become merciful.</p>
<p>“Really? You are truly kind as the rumors say. Then I will see you next year, Lady Skad.” Count Glaica bowed and greeted her respectfully.</p>
<p>It was an ordinary greeting, but Amethyst had turned grey. Because of the mention of next year, she had lost all the colour from her face. Next year Amethyst would not be here any longer.</p>
<p><em>I will no longer be Lady Skad…I…what have I done?</em></p>
<p>The person who would soon be gone from this place was Amethyst, not Count Glacia. She was the person who would need to disappear from his side. With everything given to her for her needs and to fool the eyes of others, she had gotten too engrossed in this marriage.</p>
<p><em>What if they were the ones who are supposed to be together? But because of my greed, that won’t happen! What should I do if I’m the one who messed up his life?</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t help but think that she had made a big mistake by putting her greed first. She felt guilty, knowing that she would soon be gone in a few months.</p>
<p>Alexcent wondered why Amethyst was frozen to the spot with all the colour gone from her face. Wondering if something had happened between the two of them again, he glanced at Lunia. Lunia shook her head to signal that she wasn’t aware of anything.</p>
<p>“…Lady Skad, are you okay?” Count Glacia cautiously asked Amethyst who stood frozen and pale.</p>
<p>“…Ah! Yes. Have a…safe trip Count Glacia.” But even after she said goodbye, Amethyst was unable to smile.</p>
