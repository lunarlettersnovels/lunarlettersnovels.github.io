            <p><strong>Chapter 264</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst was heading towards the capital. She had arranged transportation on the public carriage that takes people from city to city, ending at the capital. If she hadn’t been able to afford the public carriage, there was no way she would’ve made it to the capital in three months. They stopped at designated hostels along the route, but she could never sleep, and during the day, she could hardly sit still. The anticipation was too much. But tomorrow, it would all end as she was on the leg of her journey.</p>
<p>Amethyst couldn’t fall asleep and stared blankly into the dark night out of the hostel window. She still was having trouble coming to the terms that Gray and Alec were the same man. She remembered the first moment she met Gray. His face was so swollen, no one was able to tell what he looked like. He had said he was a slave. That was the hardest fact to believe. There was no way that Alec would betray Belice. Sure, they had bickered but they trusted each other deeply.</p>
<p>Amethyst looked down at the paper in her hand. <em>This note is definitely the same one that I gave Alexcent, </em>she thought. <em>How else would Gray have come into possession of it?</em></p>
<p>She shook her head as she remembered the time she had spent with Gray. <em>“Gray! You must broom the corner! All the dust settles in the corner. Be careful not to break the dishes when you wash them. Don’t forget to wipe the sink after.” Was everything I said simply bossing him around? I should have treated him better.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, a chill went through her. She had told him everything about her past! The day they watched the beautiful sunset, she had talked about all of it. <em>What did he say? </em>She tried to recall his words and then they came to her. <em>“I think he would rather be with you and love you just once more, rather than to be refused without knowing why.”</em> <em>Did he mean it?</em> <em>Was that why he said he’ll wait? Why he told me to come back? Is it safe for me to go back?</em></p>
<p>Her heart was confused. She wanted to be happy with him, but she also couldn’t erase all these questions. She didn’t know if she was putting herself in danger and that made her uneasy. Belice would have the answers, and that was why Amethyst needed to meet with her first. Amethyst wanted to believe that Belice held the key.</p>
<p>But what if she found out it had been correct all along for her to leave Alec. What should she do then? Amethyst shook her head and sat through the night in her bed, the worries battling off any chance of sleep.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>She took the first express carriage to leave at dawn and headed towards the capital at top speed. There had been a fair bit of change in the city since she had left. Many of the stores were new and not merchants she had heard of. When she exited the carriage, she felt like she had entered a whole new world. She waited patiently and entered the next carriage that would take her directly to the palace.</p>
<p>The horseman, thinking her a tourist, dropped her off in front of the front gates. A guard, wearing a majestic suit of armour blocked the entrance. There had been a time when she could confidently walk straight into the palace, and no one would stop her. That wasn’t the case anymore. She wasn’t surprised. Her clothes advertised that she was now a lowly merchant.</p>
<p>Amethyst sighed and began following the walls of the castle grounds. There had to be an entrance for servants. It felt like she walked forever. The palace grounds were huge! Eventually, she stumbled on a smaller entrance, also blocked by a guard. She couldn’t just say that she wanted to meet the Empress, that would be crazy. She didn’t know how to proceed.</p>
<p>The guard, who had noticed her standing in the road, staring at the entrance, asked “What is your business to the palace? If you’re an employee, then you need to show me your identity card.”</p>
<p>Amethyst got flustered. “I don’t work here, but I would like to see someone.”</p>
<p>“Do you have an appointment?” the guard asked.</p>
<p>“No. But I really need to meet her. Is there any way?”</p>
<p>“Tell me the person’s department and the reason for your visit.” The guard was very official.</p>
<p>Department? Reason for visit? If Amethyst said she was here to meet Belice, the guard would tell her to get lost. There had to be another way. Perhaps if she asked to meet the Empress’ secretary? She had only met him a few times, but it was worth an attempt.</p>
<p>“I want to see the Empress’ secretary. The reason for my visit is sensitive. I’m afraid I can only reveal the details to him.” If this worked, it would at least get her foot in the door.</p>
<p>The officer studied Amethyst, his expression not reveling anything. “Are you an immediate family?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Distant relative then?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not.”</p>
<p>The guard looked annoyed. “He’s not someone you can meet, just because you want to meet him. You don’t have an appointment, and you’re not family, so I can’t allow you in.”</p>
<p>Amethyst felt frustrated but wasn’t surprised. She didn’t want to give up, though. “I’m his acquaintance, isn’t that enough?”</p>
<p>“Unless you can confirm your identity, you can’t come in. Now move on!” The guard was starting to get angry.</p>
<p>Amethyst tried her best to remember the name of Belice’s secretary. Then it came to her:  Karune. She pulled out the ID card that Gen had given her so long ago.</p>
<p>“Then please give a message to Karune that his acquaintance wants to meet with him. Let him decide if he wants to meet with me. Here is my ID. Can you do that much? Please.” Amethyst tried to ask as sweetly as she could, hoping to change the guard’s mind.</p>
<p>The officer seemed to be surprised that she knew the name of the secretary. He took the ID card and scanned it. Looking at her face, his eyes opened wide. He suddenly seemed extremely flustered.</p>
