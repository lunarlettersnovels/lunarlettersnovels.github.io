            <p><strong>Chapter 115 – To Protect Belice (1)</strong></p>
<p>“True, a commoner shouldn’t have been allowed to be a countess.”</p>
<p>Thus, they continued in counterpoint. The ladies dug out past gossips and rumors. Most of them were peeved for being treated badly. Amethyst knew that if she let this continue, in less than a second Count Glacia would be branded the vilest creature on earth irrespective of it being true or not.</p>
<p>Amethyst had no intention of making her tea party be about trashing other people. She wanted this tea party to be enjoyable not a cesspool of gossip. Even if Count Glacia was indeed as vile, she had no intention of letting this continue as Count Glacia herself wasn’t here to defend herself. It seemed wrong and unfair. <em>This won’t do, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>I need to change the topic of the conversation.</em></p>
<p>“By the way, Countess Onslow, that brooch is so lovely!” commended Amethyst, “I’ve not been able to look away.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, thank you. You are too kind,” said the Countess, “I received it as a gift some time ago. In commemoration of our 40 years of marriage.”</p>
<p>“Oh my! Congratulations!”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Countess Onslow suddenly seemed shy talking about her marriage and blushed a deep red.</p>
<p>“Seeing that pretty brooch reminds me…,” said Amethyst, “why don’t we all go to Newhenfield to go shopping tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Newhenfield?”</p>
<p>“Yes! If you’re all alright with it.”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a newly built city?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I went once before, and the streets are very modern and beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, I’ve always wanted to go!”</p>
<p>“Actually, we were getting a little tired of the capital. Every year we always visit the same places.”</p>
<p>“That’s a relief. I’m glad you all are on board.”</p>
<p>The conversation was thus steered successfully in other directions. The tea party continued until very late as they discussed about random tidbits of information.<br>
***</p>
<p><em><strong>‘I hear that Lady Skad likes baby’s breath.’</strong></em></p>
<p>That was what Count Glacia had said and Alexcent had called Gen to the side. “Prepare a bouquet of baby’s breath,” he had said to Gen.</p>
<p>“Baby’s breath?” asked Gen, confused.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Gen hadn’t responded and continued staring at Alexcent.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Alexcent when he saw Gen still looking at him.</p>
<p>“What are you planning?” asked Gen.</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Do you really not know?”</p>
<p>Alexcent hadn’t replied. He flipped through his documents instead.</p>
<p>“Your Highness,” said Gen, “Please.”</p>
<p>“I am listening,” said Alexcent curtly.</p>
<p>“If I may just speak freely,” began Gen, “Don’t get yourself involved between the two of them.”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“But you are planning to do exactly that,” insisted Gen, “Baby’s breath? Just because Count Glacia hinted at it, you can’t take her bait. She is obviously planning something.”</p>
<p>“Precisely,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Sorry?” said Gen, confused.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to see how Ash would react to this obvious trick?”</p>
<p>“You really are a sadist,” said Gen, “Fine. Well if you are going to support one of them, please support Count Glacia.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Madam is simply bound by a contract,” said Gen, “Logically, if you support Count Glacia, you will have a powerful ally when the contract ends next year. You always value profit, it would be to your advantage to do so.”</p>
<p>Gen’s words, although harsh, were true. If this was just a contract marriage, then the best thing to do would be to do as he said but…<em>This time I don’t want to do the right thing.</em></p>
<p>“That’s a lot of words, when all I asked was for a boquet of baby’s breath,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>Gen heaved a long, weary sigh. “Fine.” With those words he left the office and closed the door after him.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The Skad family had always been a part of the royal family. However, the throne, it wasn’t meant for the now Emperor Belice, Alexcent’s twin sister. They were merely an extended bloodline of the Royals and of not much importance not until the the royal family was struck with a problem. The previous prince had no heir, so the title had been passed to the twin siblings—one became the Emperor, and the other, Prince of Skad, and soon held the title of a duke too.</p>
<p>Alexcent had always known that their position and safety was at risk. Many desired to ascend the throne. Hence, the first thing he did was to eradicate the opposition from the royals as soon as he came to power.</p>
<p>Only a few nobles supported the Skad lineage at that time. And what now remained were the seven families that were attending the annual festival. Namely, the pro-emperor faction.</p>
<p>Amongst them the previous Count Glacia was someone who was a very different person as to how he presented himself. He was someone who always hid behind a smile, and was a spy for the other faction, looking for an opportunity. He was aiming for nothing else but the title of the prince. Alexcent’s position.</p>
<p>Alexcent who was bloodhungry for war and unmarried was an immediate target. Count Glacia believed that if Alexcent was to perish, he would be the next heir. He had considered Count Citri and Count Onslow to be too old to be a threat since they had already passed their own titles and their powers to their eldest sons. He had been like a beast waiting for the right moment to pounce.</p>
<p>Alexcent knew that if he were to die or disappear, Belice, who he was supposed to protect, would be left unguarded for Count Glacia to pounce upon. She would be played by him, even her heirs. They would have no power whatsoever. Alexcent had prayed to live at least a day longer than her so he could take care of his twin sister.</p>
<p>Alexcent knew he needed to get rid of the count, but he didn’t know how. Count Glacia was a noble and the head of his own estate so the cause should be natural. If he were to die in an accident, it would be thoroughly investigated because he was an aristocrat. Sometimes such investigations continued for years. Alexcent hated to prolong things. He liked dealing with things swiftly, without trouble. Natural caue of death would be most apt but there was nothing wrong with Count Glacia’s health.</p>
<p>That was when he had met Arwin, the present Count Glacia— a woman with a fiery determination to kill her husband.</p>
