            <p><strong>Chapter 111 – Flower Boy (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Oh, come on Gen!” said Lunia, exasperated, “It’s just one small thing!”</p>
<p>Gen sighed. He was already tired with his work and the meeting and had no energy to keep bickering with Lunia. He turned around and walked away.</p>
<p>“Gen!” said Lunia following down the hall, “Wait! Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“The conference hall, where else?” retorted Gen, “I don’t have time to waste on you.”</p>
<p>“Just do it alright?” asked Lunia, “And I will leave you alone.”</p>
<p>Gen glared at Lunia. “Find someone else!”</p>
<p>“I can’t!”</p>
<p>“Why the hell not?” asked Gen, “People would be lining up for this. Go find anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Madam told us to pick the most handsome person among the staffs,” explained Lunia, trying to keep in pace with Gen. “You should be grateful. Everyone unanimously voted for you!”</p>
<p>Gen scoffed. “You and your one personage vote, I presume?”</p>
<p>“No, me and Roman… and Madam!”</p>
<p>“Get lost from here before I lose my temper.”</p>
<p>“I can’t! I have been instructed to carry out this task and I will see it done.”</p>
<p>“Lunia, get the hell out of my face. I simply don’t have time for your petty tricks.”</p>
<p>“Well, then,” said Lunia, “If it is going to be like that you leave me no choice. Madam said you owe her a favor.”</p>
<p>“What the hell?!” cursed Gen, halting in his tracks and turning to Lunia.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything about it, alright,” said Lunia, “But she said you would understand and agree to our request if I said that.”</p>
<p>“What gibberish is this?” shot back Gen, “Now you think you can blackmail me into doing whatever stupid thing you want me to do?” Gen turned to go.</p>
<p>“Card! Stamps!” shouted Lunia from a few paces behind.</p>
<p>Gen froze and walked back to her, glaring. <em>Here I thought Amethyst was nice, </em>he thought, <em>she seems to be not a housecat but a lioness. Goddamn it!</em></p>
<p>Gen cursed and scowled. “Give it here!” he said and snatched the roses and the notes from Lunia’s hands.</p>
<p>“Be careful!” said Lunia, “Don’t break the stalks! It suits you, you know.”</p>
<p>Gen stabbed his fingers at her. “Not another word!”</p>
<p>“I am most certain that they would prefer the man over the flowers.”</p>
<p>“Lunia!” roared Gen.</p>
<p>“Don’t shout!” said Lunia with a smirk, “Congratulations on becoming the flower boy!”</p>
<p>Gen ignored her and tried to stomp away. “Oi, flower boy!” called Lunia, “Don’t forget your outfit!” Gen turned to Lunia and directed her a deadly glare. He was doing his best to control his anger. He snatched the outfit that Lunia was shaking in front of him and stomped away.</p>
<p>Roman came out from behind the pillar. She had been hiding there because she had no intention of facing Gen’s wrath. “Roman!” squeaked Lunia. She was laughing hysterically. “Did you see his face?”</p>
<p>“Are you sure it is safe to tease him so blatantly?” asked Roman. “He looked very angry.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine!” said Roman, “This is nothing compared to how he has treated me!”</p>
<p>“What did he do?”</p>
<p>“He always gives me hell for making the smallest mistake. He is so rude to me every time. He said I should work hard and efficiently if I want my head on my shoulders instead of it rolling on the ground. Threatening me every single time! He deserves this!”</p>
<p>Roman chuckled seeing Lunia laughing uproariously. “I am curious how he will look,” said Roman, “I think it will suit him very well.”</p>
<p>“We probably won’t be able to see that,” said Lunia, wiping tears of mirth from her eyes.</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked Roman.</p>
<p>“He is an elusive guy,” said Lunia, “He will find a way to carry out the chore when nobody can see him. Him with those flowers, that’s all we get to see.”</p>
<p>“Such a shame,” said Roman.</p>
<p>“My, my, Roman,” said Lunia, “The minx you are, you want to see him humiliated further?”</p>
<p>“No!” said Roman.</p>
<p>“Ha ha ha, only joking!” said Lunia, “Let’s go tell madam. We need to sort out the flowers. Lots to do!”</p>
<p>A few hours later, the mansion was awash with rumors that a very handsome and mysterious thief had appeared with flowers. He had delivered these flowers to the lady guests in the mansion.</p>
<p>A soft lavender rose for the gentle Countess of Onslow. Lovely pink rose to the amiable Countess Citri. Brilliant red roses delivered to Baroness Hours, and sweet, orange roses to Viscountess Renove. And mint, green rose to Baroness Zephyr, to match her calm countenance.</p>
<p>Gen might complain high and low, but he was always one to deliver the most efficient work.</p>
<p>*<br>
“Madam, it’s time to choose the flowers for the tea party decoration for tomorrow.” Lunia entered the room with the merchant.</p>
<p>“Greetings, Lady Skad. I am Flora, a merchant specializing in flowers.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you Flora.”</p>
<p>“Lady Skad, you plan to have the tea party tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Ah yes. It’s a small party and we would like to use flowers for decoration. Do you have any recommendations?”</p>
<p>“For how many?”</p>
<p>“A total of six people in the glass house.’</p>
<p>“Do you have an overall color in mind?”</p>
<p>“Yes. A pastel tone would be perfect.”</p>
<p>“Ah, then…why don’t we use chrysanthemums with hydrangeas?”</p>
<p>“That sounds nice. Well you know better than me, Flora. But will it be ready by tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Of course, my lady.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>“If there are any other flowers you would like, please let me know. Having a variety will make it look colorful, so it’ll look good for a small tea party.”</p>
<p>Amethyst thought about it. “What flower do you like most, my lady?” said a maid, “perhaps we can use that!”</p>
<p>“That’s a very good idea Habe!” said Lunia, “What sort of flowers do you like, my lady?”</p>
