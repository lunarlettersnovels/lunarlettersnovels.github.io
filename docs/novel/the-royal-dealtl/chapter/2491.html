            <p><strong>Chapter 177</strong></p>
<p>Lunia continued to hold onto Barden’s neck and asked, “What if someone were to see! Who do you think you’re hugging? How many lives do you think you have?”</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry, my lady. It was a mistake,” Barden insisted. Lunia released her grip on Barden but did not stop staring at him.</p>
<p>Amethyst spoke up. “Lunia, it’s all right. This is just a misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>“Madam?”</p>
<p>“Barden was just teaching me some swordsmanship while the other knights were away,” Amethyst explained.</p>
<p>“Even so, you must be careful with how physical it gets.”</p>
<p>“Understood,” Amethyst assured Lunia with a smile. She could tell Lunia still had some hesitation and would probably never to leave her side again.</p>
<p>“Barden.” Amethyst turned to the man beside her. “I’ll see you next time. It’s late.”</p>
<p>“Yes! I’ll look forward to it.” Barden nodded his head in farewell and exited the training room.</p>
<p>“What does he mean by he’ll look forward to it?” Lunia asked, after he left.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I received some help from him, so I’m just repaying the favor.”</p>
<p>“What exactly happened…while I was away?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Amethyst assured her. Unfortunately, after they returned to her chamber, Roman filled Lunia in on everything that occurred. Amethyst could do nothing but sit and listen as Lunia went on a tirade for the next several hours.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“His lordship has already left for the banquet hall,” Lunia informed Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Really?” Amethyst had assumed he was still working in his office. He had been spending most of his time there lately, and not seeing him had upset her. But ever since the talk of the contract, she didn’t want to bother him with her feelings. “Then I guess we can go straight to the banquet hall once we’re ready.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” Lunia agreed.</p>
<p>“Let’s speed things up, then. I don’t want to keep the knights waiting.”</p>
<p>Roman and Lunia rushed to prepare Amethyst for the party. She donned an open shoulder dress, which showed the curves of her body. It was the color of dark chestnuts and was the perfect dress for the welcoming ceremony. Her hair was simple, pulled back into a bun on the top of her head.</p>
<p>Roman chose a variety of non-extravagant accessories and presented them to Amethyst to choose which appealed to her.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll not wear any. It’s not like there will be another noble lady present. I don’t think it would appear suitable if I were too glammed up.” Amethyst rejected all of the jewelry, except her wedding ring.</p>
<p>Once they were finished, Amethyst headed towards the banquet hall where the welcoming party for the knights was being held.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seeing Alexcent seated on the sofa in his office, Gen approached him. “My lord, your lady has already left for the banquet hall.”</p>
<p>Alexcent looked unhappy and remained seated in silence, a deep frown creasing his face.</p>
<p>‘I’m sure she dolled up for everyone to see,” he mumbled to no one in particular. “And I’ll be bothered without even knowing it.’</p>
<p>“My Lord, it’s time for you to go,” Gen insisted, but still getting no recognition. “My Lord!”</p>
<p>“What?” Alexcent finally looked up.</p>
<p>“It’s time for you to go.” Alexcent showed no signs of moving. Gen sighed, losing his patience. “If it bothers you that much, then you can just steal her back. I’ll support you. Isn’t that what you’re best at?”</p>
<p>“What I’m best at?” There was a change in Alexcent’s eyes. Gen’s suggestion had finally got through to him. “Right! I can just steal her back. I didn’t think of that.”</p>
<p>Satisfied with his decision, Alexcent got up from his seat. Gen held up Alexcent’s uniform jacket, so that he could slip his arms in.</p>
<p>“Well, since it’s Marquis Crenson’s family, it may not be easy to compensate them for the loss. But he’s not the eldest son, so things should work out,” Gen explained.</p>
<p>“I suppose.” Alexcent seemed satisfied. Heleft the office with a determined look.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>All the knights who had already entered the banquet hall were looking around with bewilderment. Some even rubbed their eyes to make sure it wasn’t a hallucination.</p>
<p>“Captain, this is the palace where they’re having the welcoming ceremony right?” Buer asked.</p>
<p>“I believe so,” the captain replied, unsure.</p>
<p>Buer laughed. “To think there would be flowers? Look at the tables! It looks like a doll house.”</p>
<p>Leyrian picked one of the decorated flowers out of a centerpiece and held it to his nose. “I’m sure Lady Skad put in a lot of effort.”</p>
<p>“But flowers? This is awkward.” Buer looked disgusted.</p>
<p>The knights looked around the banquet hall, where petals covered the floor in layers. The walls and tables were strewn with a variety of carnations, Campanella roses, and ranunculus flowers. The colors made the hall shine. It was a far cry from the usual welcoming ceremonies that involved getting drunk and performing mock battles that always ended with some bloodshed.</p>
<p>“Why are you all standing around? Take your seats!” Amethyst had come upon the group of knights crowded at the hall entrance.</p>
<p>A scattering of startled replies erupted from the crowd: “Ah, My Lady!!”, “You’re here!”, “We were just…”.</p>
<p>“Is something out of place?” Amethyst asked the group.</p>
<p>“Of course not!” They all seemed to answer as one, then stumbled over each other as they scrambled to enter. The knights seated themselves, with close companions sharing tables.</p>
<p><em>I guess Alec isn’t here yet, </em>Amethyst thought, seeing that his chair was empty. She took her seat at the center of the long table.</p>
<p>As they waited for the food to be served, Lord Hill spoke up. “You’re looking especially beautiful today, my lady.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Amethyst replied, awkwardly. As if they could sense how uncomfortable she was, The duke and Gen entered the hall. Alexcent’s eyes met hers as he entered, and she smiled. He turned his gaze away instantly and took his seat without a word. <em>I wonder what it is this time? </em>Amethyst thought as she studied the flower arrangement in front of her. He refused to look at her and sat expressionless while studying the knights.</p>
