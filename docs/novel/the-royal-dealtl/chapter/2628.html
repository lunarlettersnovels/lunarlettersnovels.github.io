            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 45 – Piglet In the House | 19</strong></p>
<p>The knights who had been tensed up laughed out loud. The wife of the prince, who was considered to be the most elite of the noble ladies, was enjoying the roast of the knights. The Prince of Blood and his eccentric wife were a perfect pair indeed.</p>
<p>“Is there more?”</p>
<p>“Yes. There is.”</p>
<p>“Then what are you doing! Put it on the grill. I get dizzy if my rhythm stops while I eat.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Madam! Understood. Please, enjoy.” Marcus quickly topped up the pan. Then as he was about to cut it into small pieces …</p>
<p>“Hey, you don’t know the right way to eat this, do you? If you cut it now, all the juices will escape and it won’t be tasty anymore. Cut it when it’s nearly all cooked.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Understood, Madam.”</p>
<p>Forgetting her title and rank, Amethyst sat crouching amongst the crowd of knights and looking eagerly at the tripe to cook.</p>
<p>“You are very… peculiar, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“For you to eat this kind of food without any hesitation or disgust— ”</p>
<p>“Why would I be disgusted by something as delicious as this?! You’re the peculiar one. By the way, do you guys eat this every day?”</p>
<p>“No. We were reminded of the olden days and brought it to eat after our training.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then next time when you eat it, will you invite me?”</p>
<p>“— Do you really mean that?”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“Well then yes. If that’s what you want. Next time I will bring some vegetables. It tastes better if you eat it together.”</p>
<p>“Sure, please do.”</p>
<p>Thanks to the knights, Amethyst was able to taste one of her favorite dishes again. She only stopped eating once her jaw started to ache.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Argh, my chin hurts….”</p>
<p>“Just what did you do for your chin to hurt?”</p>
<p>Alexcent frowned as he saw Amethyst rubbing her cheeks with her hands. He was sitting on her bed in a gown without even drying himself and examining her face carefully.</p>
<p>“I … ate too much.” She hesitantly told him.</p>
<p>“Ha? Have you now decided to become a pig?” Even as Amethyst glared at him, he continued on unaffected. “I think you are. Just the other day you turned the bedroom into a mess, and now you eat to the extent your chin hurts. I guess we will soon have a piglet to raise in the mansion. A pet pig of the mansion… Not bad, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“What do you take me for Alec! Hmm!”</p>
<p>As she opened her mouth to shout, she felt pain in her chin and ended up groaning in pain.</p>
<p>“Come here.”</p>
<p>Even as he frowned, Alexcent took his large hands and massaged her chin.</p>
<p><em>At times like this, he seems caring… but his words are always so mean. Ah, is he what they call a Tsundere?</em></p>
<p>“I guess I can’t eat you today.”</p>
<p>At those words, Amethyst blushed. Beneath the loosely tied gown, she could see his firm muscular abs. Her eyes wandered below, and something seemed to spring up right under the knotted string. The thought of it made her body feel hot as though she was placed on top of a grill like the tripes she had eaten.</p>
<p>“Then… you should at least… get dressed.”</p>
<p>“Does it bother you?” he raised a brow as he asked.</p>
<p>“Obviously!”</p>
<p>“Oh, the piglet speaks!”</p>
<p>“Seriously, you!” Amethyst clenched her fist mimicking a punch, Alexcent laughed as he grabbed a hold of her wrist and pulled her to bed.</p>
<p>“I won’t eat you today, so go to sleep.”</p>
<p>“Umm well, you can… eat me if you want.”</p>
<p>“Wow, this piglet is saying something dangerous.”</p>
<p>Carefully, she placed a hand on his toned muscles. As warmth spread from the firmness under her palm, she subconsciously brought her lips to his chest.</p>
<p><em><strong>Peck!</strong></em></p>
<p>At the same time, Alexcent who had been taking deep breaths stopped. “Well… I guess a baby pig is tasty as well,” he said raspily.</p>
<p>Putting a finger under her chin, he brought it away from his chest and towards his lips before invading her mouth.</p>
<p>“Hmmm… .”</p>
<p>Her aching jaw made her flinch but Alexcent paid it no mind and began to plunder her mouth arbitrarily, sweeping his tongue evenly from the inside of her cheeks to the bottom of her t0ngue.</p>
<p>With just a kiss, her body was already wet. He bit her lip, peppered kisses as he moved downward and lingered around her neck.</p>
<p>His hands had managed to rip her dainty undergarm3nts and moved vigorously between her legs. He applied pressure as he touched her, the satisfying sensation travelled through her body making her m0an.</p>
<p>“Ah… mm. Ale…c”</p>
<p>At the sound of her m0ans, she felt his smile on her neck. She turned her head and brought his lips to hers as if to hurry him.</p>
<p><em>Ahh, his wet and warm tongue. Even his breath is delicious.</em></p>
<p>Their kisses moved from lips to cheeks, ears, and necks. As his fingers continued to play between her legs, the sensation must have teased her for she clenched them around his hand, urging him on.</p>
<p>Then, his long thick finger entered her, she reflexively lifted her hips up high. His finger continued to pleasure her but it seemed insufficient. Amethyst lifted her hips higher and ground against his hand.</p>
<p>“Ha… please… .” She drawled out.</p>
<p>“Oh my… I guess one isn’t enough now.” He inserted another finger inside her, it felt fuller than before.</p>
<p>As the two fingers moved rapidly the sounds grew louder, and her heat leaked out. Even then, it still wasn’t enough for her as she wrapped her arms around his neck.</p>
<p><em>It’s not enough!</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, fullness! His fullness! I need that. Quickly. Please give it to me and make me forget everything else!</em></p>
