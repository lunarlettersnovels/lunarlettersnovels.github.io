            <p><strong>Chapter 180</strong></p>
<p>“Yes, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“You’re bleeding….”</p>
<p>Barden wiped the blood off with the back of his hand as though it was no big deal. “Madam Lunia had warned me…but it’s my fault for ignoring her warnings.”</p>
<p>“But… Barden you were just comforting me. I’m sorry that you got hurt because of me.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. I’m more worried for you, my lady.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. It’s already….”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. Do you think you can get up?”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Barden brushed his pants and stood up.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry and thank you,” said Amethyst, “Then I’ll be going first.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you will be alright? His Excellency seemed very angry….”</p>
<p>Amethyst smiled sadly at Barden and tried to brush it off indifferently. She gave him a curt nod and walked in the direction where Alexcent had gone moments before. She was constantly living in fear that she might disappear one day, so she knew that she didn’t have much time.</p>
<p><em>Even a day is so precious to me. I don’t have time to quarrel with him.</em> Every second, every minute was so precious to her right now.</p>
<p>Amethyst rushed to open her bedroom door, but there was nobody inside. It should have been obvious to her. She turned around and opened his bedroom door, nobody was there as well. The only place left was his office now. She headed that way.</p>
<p>Seeing the light through the space at the bottom of the door, she felt her heartbeat loudly against her chest. She wondered why the sight of him getting angry somehow made her feel happy. She couldn’t help but hope that his anger meant something. She had tried so hard to find any meaning in all this. Without knocking, she opened the door.</p>
<p>The creaking sound was particularly loud.</p>
<p>He was seated on the sofa with his eyes closed. Because of his anger, there were frown lines on his face. His jacket was thrown haphazardly on the floor and several of his shirt buttons had come off and rolled around on the floor.</p>
<p>Sitting against the backrest, his elbow rested on the armrest, and his fingers swept his forehead. Sensing a presence, Alexcent looked up and saw her. Every time, she took a step towards him, he felt each nerve of his body tingling.</p>
<p>“Go to bed,” his hoarse voice rang.</p>
<p>Amethyst ignored his words and continued to approach him. His red eyes studied her. His stare gave her goosebumps. Amethyst stood in front of him. Then she sat herself down on his lap. If he refused her, then there was nothing she could do, but hoping that he wouldn’t, she placed herself in his arms.</p>
<p>Thankfully he did not reject her. But neither did he embrace her. With her straddling him, she wrapped her arms around the back of his neck. Even then, he did not move.</p>
<p>“Alec,” she cautiously called out his name. There was no response. “Alec,” she tried again. “Please don’t misunderstand. Barden was just trying to help me.”</p>
<p>“Misunderstand?” he barked.</p>
<p>“Yes. Something got into my eyes, and I was crying. So, he was just trying to help me…”</p>
<p>For the first time, she lied to him. <em>No. I myself am a lie….</em></p>
<p>“Ha, how laughable!” said Alexcent, “Do you really expect me to believe that?”</p>
<p>“If not, what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“What?” As Amethyst provoked him, Alexcent turned to look at her. She smiled as their eyes finally met. She snuggled close to him and placed her head on his chest.</p>
<p>“Stop it.”</p>
<p>“No.” This time she placed her lips on his bare chest that showed through the partly unbuttoned shirt.</p>
<p>“Ash…” She licked at it.</p>
<p>“Stop…it.”</p>
<p>“Do you not like it?” she asked.</p>
<p>Alexcent did not answer her. Amethyst decided to be bolder. She bared her teeth and bit his chest lightly.</p>
<p>“Ahh…” With a moan, she felt him stiffen beneath her. She was happy that he was aroused.</p>
<p>“Ash…”</p>
<p>“Alec…” Just calling each other’s names made them ache for the other.</p>
<p>“Ash…stop.” Alexcent grabbed Amethyst’s arms and pushed her away. <em>And I was full of hope like an idiot again…. </em>Him rejecting her like this made her tear up.</p>
<p>“I’m not confident that I can be gentle today,” Alexcent whispered in Amethyst’s ear.</p>
<p>“That’s okay…” She replied in a whisper.</p>
<p>Alexcent held back his laugh and bit her ear lightly. <em>Really, I can never win over you, </em>thought him, <em>you might be probably the only person I enjoy losing to.</em>Alexcent ripped her black dress and lowered his lips to her chest.</p>
<p>“Ahhh,” moaned Amethyst as he bit her there.</p>
<p>“Al…lec.”</p>
<p>Alexcent sighed and got up. Amethyst got to her feet and faced him. He took her hands and placed it on the sofa. “Bend over,” he said.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Amethyst, “Why?”</p>
<p>She hesitated. But Alexcent grabbed the back of her head and made her bend over. He unbuckled his belt and pulled down his pants. He then bound Amethyst’s wrists on the sofa and secured it with the belt.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I told you,” He said, hoarsely, “I can’t be gentle today.”</p>
