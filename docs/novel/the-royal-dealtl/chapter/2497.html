            <p><strong>Chapter 171</strong></p>
<p>After they had got into bed, Alexcent could not stop kissing Amethyst’s hand. <em>Does Alec have a fetish?</em> Amethyst wondered. <em>He has not stopped touching my hand since we go here. Ouch!</em> He had bit the back of her hand.</p>
<p>“Alec? My hand. It feels swollen.”</p>
<p>Alexcent silenced her by pressing his lips against hers. He opened her mouth with his forceful tongue, which he ran along her teeth and then brushed the inside of her cheek. Each of Amethyst’s nerve cells flinched and she trembled.</p>
<p>“Al…e…!” she moaned.</p>
<p>He clamped on to her with a ferocity, as if he had desire flowing through his veins. Amethyst could tell that he would not be dissuaded from intimacy. Alexcent pulled her closer to his chest.</p>
<p>“Alec,” she gasped, trying to catch a breath.</p>
<p>Alexcent lowered his head, lifted her chin a little and put his lips on hers once more. She instinctually cupped his face with her hands as their tongues tangled with each other. Alexcent revealed one of her full breasts, his fingers twisting and caressing her nipple. His other hand made its way between her legs, rubbing at the entrance to pleasure with a finger. Her legs spasmed with joy as she moaned in his arms. It took no time for his finger to become slippery with her juice.</p>
<p>“You’re so wet already,” He whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>“Don’t say…that,” Amethyst sighed</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s embarra….. uhhhhh!”</p>
<p>One of his thick fingers made its way inside of her. “As if this could be embarrassing,” Alexcent said, slyly.</p>
<p>A second finger entered her. Amethyst instinctively closed her thighs as the pressure built inside.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” Alexcent admonished her.</p>
<p>“But!” Amethyst gasped.</p>
<p>“If you don’t open your legs, my finger will be inside forever.”</p>
<p>His fingers spread her wide and he put his long, middle finger deep inside. The motion made her gush even more.</p>
<p>“Please!” Amethyst pleaded, while letting out rough breaths.</p>
<p>“Open,” He spoke again.</p>
<p>Amethyst’s thighs slowly opened at his command. Alexcent seemed pleased and took out his finger as she had wished. Amethyst shook, on the verge of orgasm and the juice that was created came out all at once, soaking the bed.</p>
<p>“See, you’re already so wet.” His finger immediately thrust back in, which he began to shift in and out as he massaged her cl*t. Amethyst’s hips rocked with the motion of his hand.</p>
<p>“Alec! Now!” Amethyst cried. The thought of him inside of her was more then she could handle. Her desire had reached its limit and she began to feel dizzy.</p>
<p>Alexcent, at her urging, positioned himself above her and thrust himself inside. The heat of the moment made short work on him, and soon he had filled her with his seed.</p>
<p>Alex looked Amethyst in the eyes and smiled. “See, you and I are connected like this.”</p>
<p>Amethyst, who was embarrassed by s*x talk, blushed and cried, “I told you, don’t say things like that!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The welcoming ceremony didn’t occur right after the appointment ceremony. Usually, it happened between seven to ten days after. Amethyst picked the eighth day, as that seemed to be the normal time frame.</p>
<p>The decorations, for the ballroom had been arranged with Floria, the flower merchant. The kitchens had been instructed to prepare a wide variety of meat dishes. She also arranged for an endless flow of alcohol, following Pon’s advice. Everything seemed to be proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>Amethyst decided to take a break. She changed into comfortable clothing and headed to the training room. Strangely, it was empty. Without a sparring partner, she would only be able to practice her postures. It had been a while since she wielded a sword and she hoped she hadn’t forgotten any of her technique.</p>
<p>“Your elbow’s too high.” The booming, bass voice made Amethyst jump. She lowered her sword and turned her head. Standing in the doorway was Barden Crenson.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you were learning swordsmanship,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord, though it hasn’t been for very long. I’m just learning it as self-defense.”</p>
<p>“Ma’am, please use informal speech. I may be a noble but I don’t have a title, so you don’t have to address me formally.”</p>
<p>“All right. Then can I just call you Sir Barden?”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>
<p>“Do we know each other?” Amethyst wanted to see if he knew who she was.</p>
<p>“Yes, no. No.” Barden seemed confused.</p>
<p>“Your answer is very strange,” Amethyst said.</p>
<p>“Sorry. It’s first time I’ve met you in person.”</p>
<p>“So, do you perhaps know? That there was once talk of marriage between us?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. I wanted to meet you,” Barden replied</p>
<p><em>I see. That’s why he kept staring at me, </em>Amethyst thought. <em>Was he perhaps attracted to me? Maybe he had wanted the marriage to go through. That can’t be true.</em></p>
<p>“Did you pick the duke’s family just because you wanted to meet me?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“No, that’s not it. Don’t miscomprehend. The reason I came to the duke’s family was because of someone I like.”</p>
<p><em>Like? So, there’s someone he likes.</em> Amethyst had almost made a fool of herself.</p>
<p>“Someone you like?” She was curious who it was.</p>
