            <p><strong>Chapter 130</strong></p>
<p>Gen shook his head at the duke’s reply, as they entered the conference room. Unlike Gen, who could tease Alexcent about it, and Alexcent, who appeared nonchalant about it, the other nobles were extremely uncomfortable and didn’t know where to look.</p>
<p>The thoughts going through their minds went something like this: <em>‘I had thought Lady Skad was a very naïve young lady’, ‘She seems to be more like a fox’, ‘The duke is amazing but Lady Skad must be truly formidable to leave such scars on him’.</em></p>
<p>Nobody dared speak their thoughts aloud. After the duke and Amethyst had left the office yesterday, Count Renove and Count Houres had reprimanded Baron Piamon.</p>
<p><em><strong>“What on earth were you thinking?” count Renove had asked.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“If this leads to a fight…,” Count Houres had said, “Did you not see the look in the duke’s eyes?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“My sentiments exactly,” Count Renove had said, “I was so anxious that he was going to smash the glass. You really are so clueless, flirting with the lady like that!”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Do you think I would ever risk my own life if I knew it?” said Baron Piamon, sadly, “I didn’t know. I was trying to make her feel better and not embarrass her. If I had rebuked her, it would have been the death of me! You didn’t even try to help me. You all are so mean.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Ahem,” Count Renove cleared his throat, “We are very sorry for not coming to your aid.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Indeed,” said Count Houres, “We are really sorry Piamon.” He patted him on his shoulder.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“What do I do!” lamented Baron Piamon, “Do you think this will affect his judgement on the tunnel construction?”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Count Glacia had directed Baron Piamon a cold glare for all his whining.</strong></em></p>
<p>Baron Piamon looked at the duke with scared eyes. Surely, the duke would punish him for whatever happened yesterday. Alexcent turned to him.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about your approval,” he said to Baron Piamon, “Do a thorough analysis then report everything from design ideas to construction. The scale, foundation, the construction itself, the excavation method. Make sure to hire specialists and create a proposal.”</p>
<p>Baron Piamon was shocked into silence. Eventually he found his voice. “Yes, of course!” he stammered, “Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>Alexcent had already found Amethyst’s tunnel idea very logical, and he wasn’t going to dismiss that idea anyway. Baron Piamon, who had barely slept a wink, seemed to come back to life, finally.</p>
<p>“Next,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>The meeting proceeded smoothly and in a very fast pace. Contrary to yesterday, count Glacia remained silent throughout the meeting today.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“No,” Alexcent, who had returned to Amethyst’s room after the meeting, answered curtly.</p>
<p>“Alec, please,” begged Amethyst, “Don’t be like that…”</p>
<p>“I said no,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“And why exactly?”</p>
<p>“Just…no.”</p>
<p>He rubbed the towel on his wet hair, attempting to dry it. He sat at the edge of her bed. Amethyst yanked the towel from his hand and rubbed his head for him, instead.</p>
<p>“I won’t put myself in danger,” she said, “You will be there anyway. Please, I will be very careful.”</p>
<p>Alexcent didn’t respond. He sighed, wearily and took the towel back from her. <em>Why do you need to be so stubborn? </em>Amethyst thought. Since her persuasion wasn’t working, she decided to drop the act.</p>
<p>“Just tell me why,” she implored, “Why is it that you don’t want me to participate?”</p>
<p>“Ash…,” he said, “Just…no.”</p>
<p>“I at least deserve a reason,” she persisted.</p>
<p>Now they were having a disagreement due to the hunting match. It seemed as though words didn’t get through to him. He had never rejected her requests outright. Even when she had wanted to learn swordplay, he had never rejected her. <em>Is there really no other way? </em>Amethyst thought sadly.</p>
<p>Amethyst was angry. “Well, it’s a no from me today, too,” she said and pulled the covers over herself and turned away to sleep.</p>
<p>“Ash…,” he said softly.</p>
<p><em>Oh, goddam it, don’t call me like that! </em>She covered her ears. His sweet voice wasn’t going to woo her!</p>
<p>“Ash….”</p>
<p>“Don’t call me like that,” she said.</p>
<p>“Ash, listen to me.”</p>
<p>“I am sleeping.”</p>
<p><em>I wish she would let it go just this once, </em>he wished. Alexcent took of his robe and threw it aside. He then pulled her to him, cover and all, wrapping his arms around her.</p>
<p>“Goodnight, Ash.”</p>
<p>Amethyst did not reply.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“He said no,” sobbed Amethyst, clinging onto Lunia, pretending to cry as a last resort.</p>
<p>“Clinging to me won’t change it, you know,” said Lunia, who wasn’t fooled.</p>
<p>“Lunia!” said Amethyst, “But why? Why can’t I go? Is there no other way at all?”</p>
<p>“Well, how would I know? Seems to me, there is none,” said Lunia, “Anyway I will remove the hunting match from your schedule.”</p>
<p>“No! No! No!” said Amethyst, stubbornly.</p>
<p>Lunia sighed and tried to change the topic. “Madam, more importantly, you need to focus on the upcoming ball!” said Lunia, “It’s just around the corner. Please don’t tell me you have forgotten about it.”</p>
<p>“The Ball?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I have already instructed Pon to prepare everything the same as last year,” said Amethyst, “What’s there to do more about it?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Well… it seems that the other ladies are rather looking forward to it. Like the tea party, you did it so differently, everyone was so excited. I mean, if the ball is the same as last year, there won’t be a problem. But I am sure the ladies will be a tad bit disappointed since they are all looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>Amethyst frowned. “How was it last year?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Same as every year,” said Lunia, “Invites are sent out not only to the nobles here but also to other nobles all around the capital. There is dancing, food, people huddle together and chat in their own little groups and then they go back.”</p>
<p>“Wow… sounds extremely dull,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>Amethyst thought it might not be very dull for her since it would be her first time attending a ball but if this was done every year, the others would be sick of it by now. Time was very short for her to come up with something exciting and new. <em>What have I been doing all this while, really? </em>Amethyst tapped her cheek with her forefinger and contemplated for ideas. She had a gleam in her eyes after a while.</p>
