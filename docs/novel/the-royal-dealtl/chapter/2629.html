            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 44 – Taste of Home</strong></p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“He must have lost quite a large amount. Did he raise his request to the head of Alst?”</p>
<p>“No. This time it was to the Fidorun Bank.”</p>
<p>Fidorun Bank was a private bank managed by the Skad family through the shadows. It was notoriously known for its considerable interest rates. Although it was a bank on the surface, it was more like a private loan business. Therefore, it was rare for people to visit unless they were in dire need of cash.</p>
<p>For Celios to visit the bank, revealed how bad his situation was. His terrible gambling addiction was common knowledge. However, due to his high position in the large temple, it was hushed up. To Alexcent, he was a good prey. The temple was like a spring; full of donations collected every week, every month, and every year, that didn’t dry up.</p>
<p>“That old man, he must have been quite desperate.”</p>
<p>“What should I do?”</p>
<p>“Approve it. It’s not our loss if he loses even more.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir.”</p>
<p>“Tell them to loan him plenty, and also tell Kairan to increase the bid for this round. We should reap as much as we can. He might end up selling the temple at this rate.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir. Would that be all?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you may leave.”</p>
<p>As Gen disappeared from sight, Alexcent leaned back in his chair and got lost in his thoughts.</p>
<p><em>‘Soloist… workaholic… eyesore’</em></p>
<p>He wondered where she’d learnt such phrases that weren’t commonly used by noble families. Even his sister and Emperor Belice did not dare use such words. Yet there she was, speaking them as if it was nothing. Not only that, she had been meticulous and made suggestions on details that he had not been able to catch.</p>
<p><em>An ordinary noble lady?</em></p>
<p><em>No! She really was a fascinating woman.</em></p>
<p>But it was even more fascinating that he was letting her act as such.</p>
<p>※</p>
<p>The man lowered his head and greeted her first. “Pleased to meet you, my lady. I’m Hilder Kurn, the Commander-in-Chief of the Knights of the Prince.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Knight Hilder.”</p>
<p>“Please call me Hill. His Lordship calls me that way as well.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p><em>Seriously? I must not be the only one he addresses as he pleases!</em></p>
<p>Then the knights standing side by side offered their greetings to Amethyst as well.</p>
<p>“Greetings Madam. I am Buer, Commander of the First Division.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“I am Leyrian, Commander of the Second Division. It is an honor to meet you.”</p>
<p>After that, Garf, Commander of the Third Division, and Marcus, Chief Knight of the First Division, greeted her.</p>
<p><em>Wow! Do they pick the knights based on looks?</em></p>
<p>Hilder was a firm looking, well-built sort of man that left you with a strong impression. Buer and Leyrian were cold and city-style kind of men, but still warm towards her. While Garf and Marcus glistened with playfulness and youth.</p>
<p><em>I feel like I’m at a movie set. Surrounded by beautiful men, what a treat to my eyes!</em></p>
<p>Even so, Alec still topped the list.</p>
<p>“Anyways, Madam, what are you doing all the way here without a maid?”</p>
<p>“Oh! I smelt something delicious. Is that … intestine?!”</p>
<p>Behind the bulky knights, she saw a familiar sight.</p>
<p>“Pardon?!” The knights turned to look behind them, in the direction of Amethyst’s gaze. Some of the knights who had finished training were sizzling something on a large grill. To be exact, it was a dish of animal’s organ meats, eaten when there was a shortage of supplies during the war. It was a body part people didn’t normally eat, but it was considered a great dish in times of war.</p>
<p>“Oh my, oh my! Looks so delicious!”</p>
<p>As she saw the plump tripe being grilled on a hot iron plate, Amethyst’s eyes gleamed while her mouth watered.</p>
<p>“Ma-madam … this is not a dish fit for a noble lady.”</p>
<p>“Why? Is this all you have? If there isn’t enough, I’ll share my portion of steak!”</p>
<p>“No. It’s not that, how could a noble lady like yourself eat this dish made of leftover parts?” one knight asked her incredulously.</p>
<p>“That’s prejudice. I love that dish very much! I can’t eat it because there isn’t enough of it!”</p>
<p>“Sorry? How would Madam have tried this dish that is common only during the war?” Hill asked in disbelief while looking at Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Ah, I … I saw the knights at my estate eating it.” She laughed nervously, hoping to cover up her bad lie. “Anyways, that piece is burning! Flip it quick!”</p>
<p>Marcus who had been standing next to Hill flipped the pieces. The knights stood awkwardly looking at each other as they found it strange for their lady to suddenly appear out of nowhere and take such an interest in their low-class dish.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amethyst’s attention was entirely focused on the grilling tripe, to take note of the awkward atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think we can eat it now? I think it’s all cooked.”</p>
<p>“Will you really… be okay, my lady?”</p>
<p>As Hill asked in a worried tone, Amethyst quickly picked up the most golden looking piece and popped it in her mouth. She bit into it, the savory and greasy meat wrapped around her tongue, and the chewy texture of the intestines made her eyes close in pleasure.</p>
<p>“Mmm. This is it! Taste of home!”</p>
