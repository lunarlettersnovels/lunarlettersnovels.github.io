            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 65</strong></p>
<p>In front of Alexcent to the left stood Amethyst and to the right were Dajal, Pon, and Gen. Judging from their expression, it was evident that this wasn’t going to go down well.</p>
<p>“So, do you want to explain why you were dressed up as a maid at Dajal’s residence?” The low-pitched, cold voice froze Amethyst. Alexcent’s voice was so sinister that it made the hairs on her hands stand up. She was scared. She could feel the tremors in her fingertips. She had to say something, anything. But the panic made her blank and tongue-tied. She could feel the dread ringing in her ears.</p>
<p>A dull, slurred voice spoke. “My Honorable Master. I’ve committed a heinous crime,” said Dajal, on his knees as though pleading for his life.</p>
<p>“Heinous crime?” said Alexcent dangerously.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know!” said Dajal in desperation. “I didn’t know she was the Duchess! I just assumed she was a maid, trying to seduce me. Forgive me, Lord! My life is at your feet, you can put an end to it as a punishment for me not being able to overcome my temptation.”</p>
<p>Amethyst directed a glare at Dajal. <em>What the hell is he even talking about? When did I ever seduce him? </em>Dajal, however, was impervious to her glare. Neither did he care. He just said what he said to escape Alexcent’s wrath.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency,” pleaded Dajal, “That’s the whole truth. I do not know why the respected lady came into my house. I can’t understand why. How was I to know that the maid who was trying to seduce me was the Duchess in disguise? Please believe me!”</p>
<p>“No!,” said Amethyst, exasperated, “That never happened. You filthy, vile cockroach. What are you even saying? Nobody here is going to believe your outrageous lies.” She stared fiercely at Alexcent as she said this, searching his face.</p>
<p>“Then tell me why you were there, dressed as a maid?” said Alexcent icily. She felt his frosty tone unnerve her. There was anger beneath it.</p>
<p><em>Why does he not believe me?</em> Amethyst gathered what was left of her courage and spoke, “I… I was working undercover.”</p>
<p>“Undercover?” he asked, eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, undaunted, “I had heard about Dajal and his assaults on the maids. I had also heard about the embezzled maintenance fees that were supposed to be paid to them. I did what I had to do in order to gather evidence. Because nobody anywhere seems to care about the maids and their plight. I—”</p>
<p>“You Excellency!,” shouted Dajal, interrupting her. “That is not true! Duchess Amethyst is lying. I am innocent.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was appalled by his audacity. “Innocent? You villainous, dirty liar!” she shot back. “I have seen with my own eyes the state in which the maids live. The living condition, their house, their clothes aren’t fit for any human. I have all the evidence I need to convince me of your misconduct, you slimy roach!”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency!” begged Dajal, still on his knees, “I never did anything wrong. She is lying. I have always been loyal and devoted to the Duke of Skad. I am sure you remember that there was a time when the maids were caught stealing the maintenance fees. They tried to frame me! The precious, well-respected Duke stood by my side and proved my innocence. History repeats itself, My Lord. The same injustice is being done to me now. Please do not doubt my loyalty, Your Excellency! This is greatly unfair.”</p>
<p>Amethyst took a deep breath. She calmed herself. Losing her head with this scum would not help anything. “I have seen it for myself,” she said, levelly, “He has been assaulting his employees. I have seen the condition they live in.”</p>
<p>“That is just corporal punishment!” cried Dajal, justifying himself, “When managing a huge group of people… one has to take matters into their own hands sometimes. It was inevitable. I used the cane on them because they broke the discipline of my mansion that I uphold with pride. Sometimes, a man needs to use force to keep his people in line. It was just a simple punishment meted out to the ones at fault.”</p>
<p>“You call splattering blood and ripping flesh a ‘simple punishment’?” said Amethyst, incredulously.</p>
<p>“I admit I went a tad bit too far,” said Dajal, “But it was only to prevent any such kind of reoccurrence. It had to be done.”</p>
<p>“So you do admit that trying to keep me locked up was ‘going a tad bit too far’?” she snapped.</p>
<p>“That!” said Dajal, “How could I have known you were the Duchess? Why did you dress up as a maid and try to seduce me?”</p>
<p>“What?!” she thundered, “You piece of shit! Every word out of your filthy mouth is about seduction. Stop lying or I will cut out your tongue!”</p>
<p>Pon and Gen were taken aback by Amethyst’s anger. They had never seen her cursing and had never expected her to do so. Dajal, on the other hand, used it to his advantage.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency!” he cried, “You see this? It is very natural for the Duchess to utter such inappropriate words. The way she dresses is also a testament to it. Rumor has it, she is always trying to attract men! A behavior never to be expected from a respected lady. A few days ago, she let a driver touch her behind, I saw it!”</p>
<p>“You daft clodpole!” said Amethyst, as she lunged at him. “Your lies are getting outrageous by the second. I would never do such a—”</p>
<p>Pon had rushed over to hold her back from Dajal, who was just rising from where he knelt on the floor. “Ma’am, calm down,” said Pon.</p>
<p>“Calm down?” she yelled with anger in her eyes, “How the hell do you supposed I can calm down while this man runs his mouth slandering me with his lies?”</p>
<p>“You are the one who is trying to frame me with false charges!” said Dajal.</p>
<p>“I am going to end you,” she glowered, “You sick fuck!”</p>
<p>“Enough!” said Alexcent sharply. Everyone froze.</p>
