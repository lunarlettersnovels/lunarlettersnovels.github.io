            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 57</strong></p>
<p>“Aran is well-known for issuing borrowed name accounts, whereas Deutsche for money laundering. And Fidorun is infamous for its high-interest rates for their loans, it’s a bank that sucks away the money from the citizens of the empire. It is the most notorious out of the three. If you ever have a need to go to Fidorun bank, no matter what, you must always come and find me before that! Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Yes… .”</p>
<p><em>I guess they are like a private loan company? Aran, Deutsche, and Fidorun. I’ll keep them in mind. As I expected, it was a good idea to come and find my mother about this.</em></p>
<p>“I am not sure why the prince’s mansion is conducting transactions with Aran Bank… but if you are taking over the management as the lady of the house, I advise you to stop dealing with them.” The countess advised.</p>
<p>“Are they that bad that I should cut ties?”</p>
<p>“If it really is purely transactional then it may not be a problem… but it is a place famous for money laundering and ill-gotten funds. I’m sure it won’t happen but I worry just in case word spreads that you are dealing with them. And even us in the Banks Union don’t know who the real owner of Aran Bank is, so it’s better to be safe than sorry since you are the wife of the prince.”</p>
<p>“Banks Union?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Every year all the heads of the banks come together to set the benchmarks for interest rates and never has the owner of Aran Bank shown up.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p><em>Based on the information I have so far, it seems very likely that Dajal’s embezzled money is in Aran Bank. But if they don’t disclose transactions, it means I’ve hit the wall.  An owner that doesn’t reveal himself… Dajal can’t be the owner, can </em>he<em>?</em></p>
<p><em>I </em>wonder<em> why I feel so uncertain…</em></p>
<p>As Amethyst fell deep in thought, clear signs of worry were born on Countess Lohikin’s face. She caught on to the change in expression, she had not intended to cause her mother to worry.</p>
<p>Even in the previous world when she had lived with her parents before she had gotten married, the only topic she’d ever discussed with them was about work as she didn’t want them to worry. After she got married she told them even less. Instead of going on and on about her life, she was busy trying to reassure them that she was doing well. Since to them, her living well was something to be proud of.</p>
<p>Realising that asking any more would cause her mother to worry, Amethyst decided to change the subject.</p>
<p>“How is Father these days? And what about Merrild and Matin? Where are they? Do they still fight?”</p>
<p>“Your father is busy as always, Merrild and Matin should be studying at the academy. Don’t even mention the fighting. But these days Merrild is being patient with Matin.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. Is Merrild 17 this year?”</p>
<p>“No silly. She’s 18. Soon she’ll need to have her coming of age party. Maybe that’s why? She’s a lot more collected and well-behaved these days. Oh, and since you are here why don’t you stay the night. It’ll make your father happy.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no. I need to go back soon,” Amethyst said.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to stay and see your father? He will be very disappointed.” Countess Lohikin urged</p>
<p>“That’s… erm today Alec might come home early….”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess I was being insensitive when you guys are newlyweds. These days your father has been coming home rather late. I thought he would be coming home earlier now that he is a vice-minister.”</p>
<p>“Really? Do tell him not to overwork himself… and take care of his health. Next time, I’ll come together with Alec.”</p>
<p>“Will you?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Amethyst smiled.</p>
<p>Now that she thought of it because she had gone to sleep early these days she had barely seen Alexcent. Since she wasn’t tired after a long day of labour and not exhausted as usual she was determined to wait up for him…</p>
<p>Since the busy Alec might come home earlier today.</p>
<p>⤩</p>
<p>“Madam, His Imperial Highness has arrived.”</p>
<p>“Really? He really did come home earlier today.”</p>
<p>When she heard that Alexcent had returned home early just as she had wished, Amethyst got up from her seat in a hurry to greet him. She was about to eat dinner that was placed on the table in front of her.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re not asleep today for a change.”</p>
<p>But even before she could leave the bedroom, Alexcent appeared.</p>
<p>He was still dressed in his court robes. He must have heard that she had not gone to bed yet and came straight to the bedroom without changing out of his clothes.</p>
<p>“It’s not time for bed yet.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you were having your meal. Good, I’ve not eaten so let’s eat together.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go to the dining room… .”</p>
<p>“No need.”</p>
<p>Alexcent turned his gaze and gave his orders. “Have it prepared.”</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lord.”</p>
<p>The maid bowed and exited the bedroom, then immediately as though they had been waiting, Pon and a maid entered with a tray of food.</p>
<p>Since it was the butler’s responsibility to prepare the meal of the prince, Pon took the liberty of setting the table even though it was Amethyst’s bedroom. Then he bowed and quickly left.</p>
<p>“Please let me know if you need anything else. Then, enjoy your evening.”</p>
<p>The maids left as well and it was only the two of them in the room.</p>
<p>Amethyst was appreciating that face she had long missed. Recently her eyes had been rotting away because she had only been looking at Dajal’s face, so looking at the one before her felt like she was being revived mentally and physically.</p>
<p>She had been appreciating his visage when their eyes met, so she quickly opened her mouth to talk.</p>
<p>“Today, I went to Lohikin Mansion.”</p>
<p>“I see.” Alexcent had already been briefed by Pon, but answered as though he wasn’t aware.</p>
<p>“Yes. I went to visit mother.”</p>
<p>“Your mother?”</p>
