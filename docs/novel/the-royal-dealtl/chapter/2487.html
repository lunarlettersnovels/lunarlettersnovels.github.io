            <p><strong>Chapter 181</strong></p>
<p>“But!” she looked at his belt that held her wrists. With a mixture of excitement and concern, she turned to face him. But his hands turned her head away, facing the front. “Don’t look,” he said. <em>Don’t look at my ugliness…</em></p>
<p>With her hands tied and her face resting on the cushions, her hips were raised. “Alec…?” she stammered.</p>
<p>Alec appreciated the view momentarily, before bending over to place his lips on Amethyst’s neck. Amethyst felt a chill. She closed her eyes. His lips travelled down her spine. With her hands tied, she felt extremely sensitive about every touch.</p>
<p>“Hmm!” His lips were already enough to entice her. She was already dripping wet. Proving that she was ready. Alexcent stopped his foreplay, grabbed her hips and pushed himself deeply inside.</p>
<p>Amethyst cried out in pain and continued crying out between short, rough breaths. Alexcent did not stop. He indulged in the tightness of her warm insides and continued to thrust.</p>
<p>“It hurts…ahh!” He bent over and placed his chest on her back. Then he placed a finger in her open mouth. Amethyst bit his finger to bear the pain. Alexcent had no mind to notice her pain. He continued to thrust in throes of passion.</p>
<p>Her shuddering and shaking body was a sight of relish and he continued his thrusts. Her moans mingled with cries of pain made him smile. The office was filled with lewd sounds of their wet bodies and moans of one another.</p>
<p><em>Here she is so passionate in my arms, but to think none of her belongs to me</em>… Alexcent frowned as he embraced her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day, when Amethyst opened her eyes, she was in her bedroom. <em>But I was in the office… </em>She couldn’t recall what happened after, but she knew that he must have carried her to the bedroom.</p>
<p>“Gah…” she cried out in pain every time she moved. Roman rushed in noticing her awake.</p>
<p>“Madam, your bath is ready,” said Roman.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Roman.” Amethyst entered the bath with Roman’s help.</p>
<p>After some time in the warm water, her body felt better. She wore simple and comfortable clothes. She then headed to the training grounds. She wanted to loosen the muscles that felt cramped because of Alexcent. Maybe everybody had been drunk the other night, nobody was in the training ground yet.</p>
<p>“Phew…,” she looked at the sword in her hands and prepared her stance. Just then she was Alexcent walking towards her.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you resting?” he asked.</p>
<p>“What about you?” she retorted.</p>
<p>“I heard that you were here.” Those words brought a smile to her face.</p>
<p>“I wanted to loosen the muscles that got cramped because of someone.” Amethyst explained.</p>
<p>“Then you should get a massage. Are you sure working out will do the job?”</p>
<p>“I took a long bath.”</p>
<p>“I thought I made you unable to get up… I think your stamina is improving.”</p>
<p>An image of his body pressed against her while breathing roughly passed in her mind. “Really!” Amethyst looked away, trying to hide her embarrassed feelings.</p>
<p>“Grab your sword.” He commanded.</p>
<p>“But aren’t you busy?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>“But I still have time to make up with you.”</p>
<p><em>I wonder why he’s making my heart flutter.</em></p>
<p>Reigning in her feelings, Amethyst turned around and grabbed her sword. Amethyst felt Alexcent right behind her as he grabbed her sword together. She felt the tight muscles of his chest against her back.</p>
<p><em>What should I do…? </em>She was constantly reminded of last night. How he had filled her in from behind. Amethyst stiffened as her ears turned red. Amethyst swung her sword around haphazardly as her body had become rigid.</p>
<p>“Ha, Ash. You don’t call this an improvement, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah…no…it’s because you!” Amethyst turned around to face him, feeling frustrated as he criticized her.</p>
<p><em>Ah, this posture is the same as….! Oh gosh!</em></p>
<p>Amethyst bit on her lip and tried to avoid his gaze. But Alexcent was enjoying the current situation as he watched her flustered. Seeing her flinch at the smallest change in his posture brought out the playful side in him.</p>
<p>He stood right up against her, who had her back facing him, closing the gap between them.</p>
<p>With one hand, he groped her chest, eliciting a moan from her.</p>
<p>“Hmm, Alec….” As her eyes tried to avert his gaze, he grabbed a hold of her chin and kissed her. He indulged in the kiss as she called out his name and as she flung her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>Then sensing a presence, Alexcent stopped himself and pulled her with him. He led her to the back of the training ground where the area was forested. He pressed her against a tree.</p>
<p>“No, Alec… what if someone sees us.”</p>
<p>“Says the one who seduced me…there’s no time to go back to the bedroom.”</p>
<p>“No…I wasn’t seducing you…”</p>
<p>As his knee pressed against her, Amethyst could no longer suppress herself and moaned out loud. His large hands found their way into her pants and shirt and touched her soft skin. Amethyst was unable to do anything as she felt more aroused. But she was conscious of the open space as opposed to her bedroom. She wanted to give in, but her rational mind told her to stop.</p>
<p>“Ha, Alec…! No…hmm, ah….!” Amethyst grabbed his large hands and pushed it away from her shirt and placed them around her waist. Alexcent was displeased, but since this was what she wanted, he had no choice. He would have to satisfy himself with just kisses.</p>
<p>Sensing a presence, a short distance from them, Alexcent decided to be a little bolder. He lifted her up and wrapped her legs around his waist. If someone saw them from the back, they would be easily misled into thinking something lewd. He didn’t care. It was as though he wanted to flaunt this. That she was his.</p>
<p><em>First, I need to get rid of him, </em>he thought. In his determination was his belief that if he couldn’t have her then he would not give her to anyone else.</p>
