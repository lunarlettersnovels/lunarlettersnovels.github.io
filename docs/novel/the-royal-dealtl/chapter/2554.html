            <p><strong>Chapter 114 – Mysterious Death</strong></p>
<p>The other ladies were perplexed. They all turned as one to look at Alexcent. Count Glacia was looking at him, wondering what his reaction would be. With all eyes on him, Alexcent let out a humorless laugh.</p>
<p>“Of course,” he said and walked out, closely followed by Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“I apologize, Duke,” said Count Glacia when they were outside, “The Lady must be deeply mistaken. I will definitely apologize to her again privately and resolve this situation.”</p>
<p>Alexcent look down at Count Glacia who was walking by his side. “This is the last time I play along with your tricks.” It was a warning for Count Glacia to stop whatever game she was playing. She stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p>“Understood,” she bowed her head and replied.</p>
<p>Alexcent walked in quick, long strides and disappeared inside the mansion. Count Glacia turned around to look at the glass house one last time. <em>I expected her to be meek and naïve, </em>she thought, <em>Maybe I was wrong.</em></p>
<p>She had told Alexcent that the Lady was fond of baby’s breath, but she hadn’t expected him to turn up at the tea party with a boquet of it. When the duke had left the conference hall, she had rushed to reach the glass house before him and provoked the duchess.</p>
<p>“Just how much did Dajal rip off just them to get himself fired?” wondered Count Glacia.</p>
<p>With the duke defending Amethyst, there was no way Count Glacia could go on with her little games. He was a powerful man. Now that things had officially soured between herself and Lady Skad, she had no choice but to face her directly.</p>
<p><em>I’m sure she’ll give up as long as I keep provoking her,</em>thought Count Glacia. <em>Let’s see who wins.</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amethyst handed the baby’s breath to the maid and instructed her to take it to her bedroom. She didn’t want it here any longer.<em> I will throw it away later.</em></p>
<p>“Did you see Count Glacia’s face?”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“I feel so satisfied.”</p>
<p>“My words exactly. She always tries to rile things up, she deserves it.”</p>
<p>It seemed like Count Glacia wasn’t very liked in the circle of ladies. <em>I wonder what she did to make so many people dislike her, </em>wondered Amethyst. But she guessed that the way Count Glacia had acted today, it was pretty much obvious.</p>
<p>“You dealt with the situation very well, Lady Skad,” said Countess Onslow approvingly.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry for ruining the mood,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Countess Onslow, “You did well. If you had gotten angry at that moment, the foolish one would be you, not Count Glacia.”</p>
<p>“I certainly enjoyed myself when you told them to get lost.”</p>
<p>“But why are you so angry at the Prince?”</p>
<p>“What makes you think that?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“You told him to get lost as well,” said Baroness Zephyr</p>
<p>“Haha, because I wanted him to get lost. It’s alright. I have the right to be angry,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“You’re right! If it were me, we would be spending our nights in separate rooms for months,” said Countess Citri in support.</p>
<p><em>We are already doing that now, </em>thought Amethyst. It seemed like many people disliked Count Glacia. It might make it easier for Amethyst to ask about her without seeming suspicious and nosy.</p>
<p>“If you don’t mind me asking, what kind of person is Count Glacia? It seems like everyone has some issue with her,” asked Amethyst, “Forgive me if it is too forward of me to ask such a thing.”</p>
<p>“How could anyone like her? As soon as Count Glacia walked out, she stuck so close to the duke and acted as though she was really Lady Skad or something.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Every time during the annual festival… it really was quite an eyesore.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why the duke would make such a woman his mistress!” exclaimed Countess Citri. “Forgive me,” she said, “That was only a rumor. Please don’t misunderstand.”</p>
<p><em>So, she really was his mistress… </em>thought Amethyst. “Of course not,” said Amethyst, “Even if it was true, it was before our marriage, so it is none of my business.”</p>
<p>Countess Citri seemed awkward for letting slip what she said and brought out her handkerchief to dab at her forehead.</p>
<p>Baroness Hours leaped to her rescue. “Well, if it is rumors, we are talking about,” she said, “then rumor has it that the Count killed her husband to inherit the title.”</p>
<p>“No way…,” mumbled Amethyst. Rumors certainly took a life of their own and spread like wildfire. Granted that she disliked her husband, the then Count Glacia, but she didn’t think she was really that evil.</p>
<p>“Then why would the energetic and healthy count suddenly pass away? Not even a year after they got married….”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s nice to determine someone’s character solely on rumors,” said Amethyst. <em>Anyone who has experienced a work life will know how rumors could destroy one’s image in front of their colleagues and make life harder. </em>No matter how much Amethyst disliked someone, she didn’t want to gauge their personality based on rumors created by people without fearing consequences. She must approach this rationally and logically.</p>
<p>“That’s true….”</p>
<p>“But did the healthy count really just pass away?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t even a disease, or an accident.”</p>
<p>“That’s why such a rumor went around.”</p>
<p>“It’s the count’s own fault for marrying her.”</p>
