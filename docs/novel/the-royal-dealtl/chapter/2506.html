            <p><strong>Chapter 162</strong></p>
<p>Pon was torn between the two. He was busy supporting his angry Lord and taking care of the staff who were in fear. But he wanted to find out what happened to Madam to turn her so sour. She was at the center of this. No matter what he did, he couldn’t understand what had actually transpired. He felt useless and hopeless.</p>
<p>Pon truly hoped that whatever had hurt madam, she would soon recover from it and get over her anger. Pon was wondering about it when a maid blundered into his office.</p>
<p>“Mr. Pon!” she stammered, “Please forgive me! I have done a terrible thing.”</p>
<p>Pon sat her down and tried to calm her so she could talk about whatever happened. After listening to her, and finally understanding the situation, he quickly went to Alexcent’s office.</p>
<p>“My Lord,” said Pon as greeting.</p>
<p>“What is it?” barked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“I have a reason to believe that Madam is angry about Lady Roelter,” said Pon, cautiously.</p>
<p>“Roelter?” said Alexcent, “What about her?” He flipped through the documents in his hands and barely listened to Pon.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Pon, “It seems the maids were chatting among themselves on cleaning duty and Madam overheard their conversation. They must have spoken about you and Lady Roelter’s relationship in the past. I am very sorry, My Lord. I have reprimanded and warned them.”</p>
<p>“What?!” exclaimed Alexcent. “Fire them immediately. Those imbeciles!”</p>
<p>Alexcent strode to Amethyst’s room without waiting for Pon’s response.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Amethyst was in a dilemma. She made excuses to avoid him, but she couldn’t avoid him forever. She wanted to reconcile and see him again but whenever she faced him, she couldn’t help but hate him for everything.</p>
<p>She hated seeing him trying to make conversation with her. She was just his wife by contract which would be ending soon anyway. She felt guilty for getting jealous. But she couldn’t help it.</p>
<p>Amethyst heaved a weary sigh and flipped the pages of the book she was trying to read. Somebody knocked on her door.</p>
<p>“Ash,” came the voice before the door slowly swung open.</p>
<p>Amethyst looked up from her perch to see Alexcent then turned back to her book, ignoring him.</p>
<p>“Amethyst,” he said, “I think there’s been a mistake. Roelter and I weren’t anything.”</p>
<p>“You weren’t?” she said as she looked up at him again. She was seeing his face for the first time in several days. Just looking at him made her heart flutter.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, brightening, “Roelter and I weren’t romantically involved in any way. She is like a sister to me. That’s why she often came to visit.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if she shares your thoughts,” said Amethyst, “Everyone seems to think you two were a match made in heaven.” Amethyst turned back to her book.</p>
<p><em>What is this… do I even have the right to be jealous? </em>Amethyst wondered.</p>
<p>“That… I wouldn’t know,” he said, “I can’t speak on behalf of her. But Ash, on my part, it is certain that Roelter was never anything to me more than a younger sister.”</p>
<p>Amethyst continued to ignore him. “The reason I allowed her to keep visiting was because of Belice,” he said.</p>
<p>“The empress?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes, Belice was secretly in love with Roden and I was trying to help them,” said Alexcent, “I am sure Roelter felt the same way. We were both trying to find a way to help our siblings. So, she came by with her brother and Belice and Roden could see each other more. Roden cares for his sister deeply so he would always visit with Roelter by his side. I thought nothing of it. The moment Belice announced her engagement with Roden, the visits decreased. I was unaware that it had cause a misunderstanding with the employees.”</p>
<p>Amethyst trembled. Alexcent found himself a fool for making excuses and justifying to Amethyst. But feeling embarrassed and foolish was better than not being able to be with her.</p>
<p>Alexcent approached her and kneeled so that he was on level with where she was seated. He gently took her hand in his. He was relieved that she didn’t snatch her hand away from his so he placed a kiss on her hand.</p>
<p>Amethyst looked at him, surprised. He continued to trail kissed on her palm, her wrist, her arm…</p>
<p>Amethyst was no longer angry. She giggled as his kisses ticked her. “Alec,” she giggled, “Stop it.”</p>
<p>He looked up at her. “Did you really think I was in love with Roelter?” he asked.</p>
<p>Amethyst felt stupid not that she knew the whole story. She didn’t respond. Her whole demeanor gave it away thought.</p>
<p>Alexcent smiled. <em>She was jealous. How adorable!</em></p>
<p>“Were you perhaps jealous?” he asked teasingly.</p>
<p>“No!” said Amethyst hurriedly.</p>
<p>“I think you were,” said Alexcent with a smirk.</p>
<p>“No, I wasn’t!” said Amethyst, blushing.</p>
<p>Alexcent chuckled. He got up and placed a kiss on her forehead, her cheeks, and her lips. He kissed her so passionately that Amethyst forgot about everything. But it wasn’t enough, his hands were pulling at her clothes. She stalled him.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It’s still daylight,” she said.</p>
<p>“Please,” he said, “I don’t care. You haven’t let me near you for the past few days. I can’t hold back anymore. Ash…”</p>
<p>His voice felt so soothing and loving uttering her name.</p>
