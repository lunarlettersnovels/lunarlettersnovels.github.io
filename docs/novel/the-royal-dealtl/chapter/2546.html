            <p><strong>Chapter 122 – Anyone but Her (2)</strong></p>
<p>Count Glacia had no intention of meeting Amethyst until she had met Habe that morning.</p>
<p>“Count Glacia, Madam cancelled all her plans of today,” said Habe.</p>
<p>“Really?” asked count Glacia.</p>
<p>“Yes. I think she might not be feeling well, her complexion wasn’t too good.”</p>
<p>“I see…,” count Glacia smiled and mumbled. “I wonder why that is.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it because of you, count?” asked Habe.</p>
<p>“Me? Why do you say so?”</p>
<p>Habe thought that if she said something to please her, she might get something out of it. Maybe another precious jewelry. “I’m sure she is jealous of your beauty, count,” she said, “And since the Madam and the Duke are not sharing a bedroom together, I’m sure she’s must be concerned regarding you.”</p>
<p>“They don’t share a room?” asked count Glacia, intrigued.</p>
<p>Habe stopped herself. She hadn’t meant to reveal that. She felt guilty for talking about the Lady’s private life. “Yes,” she said, ashamed, “they’ve not been sharing a room.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” said count Glacia with a sly smile. She looked very satisfied with this information. She unpinned the brooch she was wearing. It was an elegant brooch with little jewels embedded at the crown. She gave it to habe. “Here is a little something for you, Habe.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, count!” said Habe and bowed her head. She walked out of the room happily. Count Glacia smiled, she was happy too. <em>Separate rooms… so Lady Skad is all by herself.</em></p>
<p>Count Glacia had reason to believe that Amethyst was the same as her. This ‘romance’ with the duke, after all, seemed to be untrue if they weren’t even sharing a room. But Habe had joined in serving Amethyst quite recently, only when the annual festival began. Habe didn’t know everything about Alexcent and Amethyst. And count Glacia, believing Habe, knew nothing of the both of them as well.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Amethyst, “I don’t know who you heard it from, nor am I interested in knowing about it. It is nothing you need to be concerned about.”</p>
<p>“I know the feeling of loneliness very well,” said count Glacia, “You need not hide anything from me.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was already in a foul mood and count Glacia was doing nothing to improve it. Instead, she seemed to be adamant to make Amethyst feel worse than she already was feeling. “I think you’ve misunderstood—”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to call it a misunderstanding. I’ve served the duke for a long time by his side, so I understand your loneliness. I know that he’s not someone you can approach easily. And you never know, maybe I might be able to serve him and that will make him more affectionate towards you.”</p>
<p>“Count Glacia,” said Amethyst, warningly. But the count ignored her.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Even though it might not be every day… every once in a while, the duke may seek me out. Did you know, Lady Skad that he is not only full of strength in the battlefield but in bed as well?”</p>
<p>Amethyst’s head was ringing. <em>I can’t listen to this anymore! </em>Amethyst looked straight into count Glacia’s eyes. The latter’s eyes were full of pity. She damn well didn’t need pity from anybody.</p>
<p>Amethyst took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“I am not sure why you have developed such an outrageous misunderstanding, but it is not something you need to concern yourself with. I have said this before,” said Amethyst, “Now, if you are done, I would appreciate it if you could leave.”</p>
<p>Count Glacia smiled. She surely hit a nerve. <em>Acting strong and composed till the end. I am impressed!</em></p>
<p>“Of course!” said count Glacia, standing up, “I have taken too much of your time already. You don’t look very well. Please rest, Lady Skad. Take care of yourself.” Count Glacia sauntered out of the room.</p>
<p>As soon as the count left, Amethyst swiped at the table in anger and a glass crashed to the floor. Roman rushed into the reception room. “Madam!” she said, “Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“I am fine,” Amethyst snapped, “It fell by accident.”</p>
<p>Roman knew her very well to know her dislike of Count Glacia. She also knew very well that count Glacia must have riled her up. “I will have it cleaned,” she said.</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded and returned to her bedroom and shut the door to the adjoining reception room. <em>Unbelievable!</em></p>
<p><strong>‘He is not only full of strength in the battlefield but in bed as well.’</strong> The words rang in her head, repeatedly. She knew how Alexcent was in bed, for god’s sake. The truth of the statement crushed her. <em>So Alexcent and Count Glacia…. </em>She couldn’t bring herself to complete the thought.</p>
<p>She wondered if they still…. Could that be the reason why Alexcent hadn’t sought her since the annual festival? <em>Don’t f*cking cheat on me! Our marriage hasn’t ended yet! Does he take me for a fool?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst shook her head as though she could dispel these thoughts from her mind. <em>No, Alexcent is many things but he is not so shallow. He isn’t someone who would resort to something like that just to spite her.</em></p>
<p>Count Glacia had tried to provoke her before, and she was doing the same again. <em>She is trying to aggravate me. But why? Power. </em>Amethyst knew the answer then, everything fell into place. Count Glacia had admitted it herself before:</p>
<p><strong>‘I used to be in charge when your seat was vacant,’</strong> Count Glacia’s words rang in her head.</p>
<p>Count Glacia was looking for every opportunity, no matter how abhorrent, to seize the duchess’ spot next to Alexcent. Seeing how she was determined to disrupt her relationship with Alexcent, she had no intention of letting go.</p>
<p>Amethyst had almost let go. She had thought that it wouldn’t matter who took her place beside Alexcent. She had even thought that perhaps Alexcent and Count Glacia would make a formidable pair. But she resolved to never let that happen.</p>
<p>Anyone but Count Glacia. She wouldn’t hand him over so easily.</p>
