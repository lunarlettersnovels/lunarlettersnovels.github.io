            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 17 – Her Demands (1)</strong></p>
<p>The duke replied dryly and stood up. Gen looked toward the duke’s knights and nodded, upon which they surrounded Amethyst.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, Lady Lohikin. Please forgive us for this rudeness.”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to kidnap me from my own house? Father! Father!” Amethyst called out to Count Lohikin, but there was no response from outside the room.</p>
<p>“Count Lohikin has left the house momentarily at our request.” Gen replied kindly.</p>
<p>“Come on!”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><em>‘This has to be an abduction!’ </em>Amethyst fumed. She had initially been with Count Lohikin, but was now in Duke Skad’s drawing room.</p>
<p><em>‘Duke Alexent Skad- the culprit could only be him!’</em></p>
<p>His silky, platinum hair that was always brushed back, combined with his captivating red eyes were irresistably intoxicating.</p>
<p><em>Not now, Amethyst</em>. She silently scolded herself. With her arms folded across her chest, she huffed and puffed, making sure he knew she was displeased. She glared at the duke. However, he seemed unbothered by her reaction.</p>
<p>“Lady Lohikin, let me make you a proposal.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was far too angry to really pay attention to him, but he continued.</p>
<p>“Have you ever heard of the term <em>contract marriage</em>?”</p>
<p>“Contract…what?” She was taken by surprise, her eyebrows raised and her mouth wide open at the thought. <em>First, it was an abduction and now a contract marriage.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst started to wonder if Duke Skad was losing his mind<em>.</em></p>
<p>“Yes, a contract marriage. Just so you know, I believe in celibacy. However, I find myself in this complication situation where marriage cannot be avoided. I need the help of a noble lady who can pretend to be my spouse for some time.”</p>
<p>“Why does it have to be me? I have grown up despising the entire idea of marriage. I don’t even like mentioning it!”</p>
<p>“Huh, Lady Lohikin, then you and I are very much alike. I too hate that word ‘marriage’. But you know your father won’t let you spend your life alone. You can’t avoid it forever. Consider it a sort of collateral. Let’s help each other out. It’ll be just a single year that you will have to endure me.”</p>
<p>Amethyst quickly calculated her options. It was an attractive offer, she could not deny that.</p>
<p>Her father, Count Lohikin, may be appeased for now, but he would certainly push her into a marriage with someone she highly disapproves of. There is no guarantee that she would be able to convince him otherwise. If she were to accept the duke’s proposal however, she could buy more time. She would even be in control of who she marries.</p>
<p>She turned towards the duke. “What happens after the year is over?”</p>
<p>“Whatever pleases you. We can publicly divorce, or I can help you start a new life somewhere else, far away from this madness. We can pretend you died in a sudden illness or an accident. I will even be able to live as a widower, mourning my dead wife forever. People will understand my desire to be alone then.”</p>
<p>“You won’t really kill me, will you?”</p>
<p>“Please, Lady Lohikin, I am an honorable man. You will have my protection.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know that. Prove to me that you will keep your promise.”</p>
<p>“Fine, how shall I prove it?” Amethyst mulled over her options.</p>
<p><em>‘Should I leave it as a document? No. Even if I were to get it notarised, what would be the use of a document when I’m already dead. It’ll obviously be a secret contract between us so I’m sure he won’t agree to it. What should I do?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Oh! The world tree. They said the world tree is the most important being in these lands. It is like a ruler. Since Duke Skad is in line to the throne, I am sure he thinks highly of the world tree.’</em></p>
<p>“Alright. Swear upon the world tree!”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“I heard the world tree is like a goddess. You’re a member of the royal family, and the royals are descendants of the goddess, so swear upon your ancestor: that you will not kill me and that you will protect my life. Do it.”</p>
<p>The duke was speechless. He stared at Amethyst, his gaze becoming intense with every second and his fiery eyes almost burning with emotion.</p>
<p>He spoke finally.</p>
<p>“Fine, I will swear it upon the world tree. I, Alexcent Frostin du Skad will protect your life no matter what. Will that do?”</p>
<p>A shiver ran down Amethyst’s spine at that response. But she persevered.</p>
<p>“Okay then. How much solatium are you going to give me?”</p>
<p>“You’re even going to request for a solatium? You’re quite a deal maker, aren’t you?</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to live without a penny to my name after one year has passed. By then I would no longer be the consort of a duke, neither a daughter of a Count.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. So how much would you need?”</p>
<p>Amethyst started to regret that she didn’t learn the currency of Sehar when she had the time. Hence, she could only give a broad statement which didn’t need her providing specific numbers.</p>
<p>“I think 10 years worth of pay from your work and two buildings you own somewhere. That should be fair.”</p>
<p>“What? You sound like you are ready to rip me off, dear Lady.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you grasp the situation. I am in no need of this ‘contract’. I don’t lose out either way. If you don’t like my offer, we can forget about the marriage.”</p>
<p><em>‘There is no way he is getting off so easily.’</em></p>
<p>She knew she had been audacious, but she did not want to back down.</p>
<p>The duke looked at her, studying her for a moment. “Fine, let’s do it.”</p>
