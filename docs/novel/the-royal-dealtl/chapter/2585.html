            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 87</strong></p>
<p>Even though the comfort may seem cliché, something anyone could provide, each word seemed to touch Alexcent’s heart with relief and calm. He smiled, though his eyes reflected the vast emptiness that he held within him. The smile passed a moment later and he hid his expression.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry though,” he said, “I was able to get my revenge.”</p>
<p>“Revenge?” Amethyst was hesitant.</p>
<p>“Do you know what the first thing was that I did when I took up my sword?”</p>
<p>“Started a war? No?”</p>
<p>“That is true, but I exterminated, to be exact.”</p>
<p>“Exterminated?” Amethyst didn’t like where this was going.</p>
<p>“All those people who were there that day. The Senate, the Temple… I killed them all,” Alexcent said without feeling.</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed humourlessly. Should she clap? Should she admire his drive or his cruelty? But then again, she didn’t think she would be at peace to see people, who’d tried to kill her in the crib, alive. “I applaud you. If I were you, I would have done the same,” Said her, out of spite.</p>
<p>“You’re so… different.”</p>
<p>“Different?”</p>
<p>Alexcent looked up at her, “You weren’t able to forgive what Dajal did, yet you compliment what I did.”</p>
<p>“What you did is in the past now.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” he seemed genuinely curious.</p>
<p>Amethyst sobered a little, “But did you really kill them all?”</p>
<p>“No,” Alexcent shook his head, “I wasn’t able to kill one person.”</p>
<p>Dared she even ask, “Why?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t kill him.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Just an old man addicted to gambling,” Alexcent said.</p>
<p>Amethyst was confused, “Why… Why weren’t you able to kill him?”</p>
<p>“He became the Hight Priest,” Alexcent explained, “Even I am not allowed to kill the High Priest. I was able to give him a taste of hell, which was much worse than death,” judging by the expression on his face, he was displeased by the idea.</p>
<p>Now it made sense to Amethyst. The High Priest was as high of a status as the Emperor, a position equal to the authority even. It was no wonder Belice wasn’t able to do anything.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said slowly, “if I should say his fate is good or bad… But is this a secret?”</p>
<p>Alexcent furrowed his brows, “Why?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘Why?’ You said you killed everyone who knew what happened back then except for one person. In other words, no one knows what had happened!”</p>
<p>“Correct, you are unexpectedly sharp-witted.”</p>
<p>“Then I too will keep it as a secret.”</p>
<p>“Amethyst… You don’t have to,” Alexcent said. When she made to protest, he carried on, “I wouldn’t care if it wasn’t kept as a secret.”</p>
<p>“How come?” she asked innocently, “Is it okay for me to recount what you just told to me to anyone?”</p>
<p>Alexcent’s expression relaxed, “Well…I’ll just have to kill anyone who hears about it.”</p>
<p>“What!” Amethyst nearly shouted, “No… But if you end up killing people…”</p>
<p>“Well,” Alexcent supressed a smile, “you did compliment me a few moments ago…”</p>
<p>Amethyst’s eyes widened in shock. ‘<em>He had to be joking about killing people.’</em> “I’ll never tell anyone… So don’t kill.”</p>
<p>He pulled Amethyst onto his lap. He raised her chin slightly and gently kissed her on the lips.</p>
<p>“I’ll try.”</p>
<p>Her lips upon his matched as though two pieces of puzzle that fit together. The meal was no longer a priority as a thrill went through her tongue. She wrapped her arms around his neck and brought his face closer. Tilting her head, she pushed her tongue deeper. The kiss became frantic. It was only broken by Alexcent pulling away to speak.</p>
<p>“As much as I’d like to continue…,” he said softly, “I have something to show you.”</p>
<p>He took her hand and got up, pulling her with him to the bedroom balcony. It was twilight, that blur of the light between night and day. The sky was darkening but not quite, it was full of different colors.</p>
<p>“Why are we here all of a sudden?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I can only use attack magic,” he said, looking at her fondly, “But I can still make this for you.” Alexcent flicked his wrist towards the darkening sky and lit it up. There was a sound of explosion. An enormous circle of light hovered in the sky before the flames bloomed and illuminated it with colors. Flames of so many colors reflected in Amethyst’s eyes as she stared enraptured.</p>
<p>“Alex…,” she stammered, unable to fathom words to describe the beauty of what she saw. “This is attack magic?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Not really,” he said, looking at her, full of tenderness, “It is something we use as an alarm, to alert others of any surprise attacks. Do you like it?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” said Amethyst, breathless, “It is so beautiful.”</p>
<p>Alexcent smiled and flicked his finger once more to set off another explosion in the sky. The sky was lit up by flames, fiery and beautiful. Amethyst laughed and hugged him.</p>
