            <p><strong>Chapter 195</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent was busy giving her tips and advice, but Amethyst seemed more excited than cautious of the risks. People whispered among themselves as they watched the duke who was always by his wife’s side. The noble women seemed to enjoy watching them and found that the rumors were true. The scary duke had finally fallen irrevocably in love.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the young women who had admired the duke felt jealousy and envy towards the pair whenever Alexcent and Amethyst showed affection towards each other. Some of the ladies expressed their hostility openly. One of whom was Arin, the Marquis of Keston.</p>
<p>Arin had always proud about her beauty. She could have been at par with Count Glacia. When Count Glacia had been by Alexcent’s side, Arin wasn’t able to express her affection for the duke. But when she had heard about their separation, she had wanted to seduce him and be married to him even. She had always secretly admired Alexcent and was never given the chance to confess.</p>
<p>When a party was held to commemorate the completion of the Bellician Palace, she had taken it as a golden opportunity to catch the eyes of the duke. She had thought it was the blessing of the god, but a young count Glacia had appeared out of nowhere and swept the duke away. And now the duke was married! It has left her fuming.</p>
<p><em>What do I lack compared to that ugly girl! </em>Arin had backed away because of Count Glacia. The lady had been of higher social status than her so it would have been difficult for her to oppose them. But she had never expected to lose the duke to someone like Amethyst. Arin believed Amethyst wasn’t really of great beauty or even social status.</p>
<p>Arin was just looking at the opportunity because Count Glacia, who was compared to her a level higher than her in the social hierarchy. She had not been holding her breath to lose the duke to someone like Amethyst, who couldn’t keep up with her beauty, let alone her status. Arin’s pride was deeply wounded.</p>
<p>She was angry at herself and embarrassed. She had become a joke to those who once expected her to be the next Lady Skad. When people are blinded by envy and jealous, they do something foolish. That was how Arin was right now. <em>I will scare her a little, </em>she thought. <em>If she can’t take this, then how would she ever expect to be the wife of a duke?</em></p>
<p>With a sly smile, Arin headed towards the gun storage keeping her eye on the duke and his wife. Amethyst, on the other hand, was unaffected by the people whispering about her. She was wholly focused on the hunting. She couldn’t help but let out a sigh when she realized that many people looked at her. She ignored them. There would be no end to this. She couldn’t try and please everyone, anyway. She tried her best to direct a bright smile towards everyone, at the least.</p>
<p><em>Yes, there’s no need to become friends with everyone. I’m just here to enjoy my time with Alec. </em>They hadn’t spent much time together since Alec had been busy with the preparation for the hunting competition. She, therefore, had no energy to waste on other people. This was their first outing and she wanted to take full advantage of it. They had, of course, gone to the palace a few times for tea, but that was all. The monsoon season had offered even fewer chance for them to be together.</p>
<p>Amethyst was excited for this moment with Alexcent. He looked regal on his horse. Even the horse took to its owner and stood there in full elegance. She watched him fondly. She watched his hands clench around the reins and flushed a deep red. She recalled those strong hands around her many a times.</p>
<p>“Ash, we should avoid the river side. These days it’s been raining a lot so the currents will be strong. It will be dangerous.” Alexcent steered his horse towards Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Of course,” responded Amethyst, still embarrassed about her drifting thoughts. She steered the horse away. He followed.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t go in too deep.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said as she pulled the reins and led the horse in a trot.</p>
<p>“Ash…” he whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes?” she turned around to look at him.</p>
<p>Alexcent placed his index finger to his lips, signaling her to be silent. The he pointed towards the bush a few paces in front of her. She looked carefully. It looked like a fox was behind the bush.</p>
<p>“Slowly…” he urged.</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded and led her horse slowly forwards. Her prey had noticed the change and was trying to escape. Amethyst cornered her prey successfully. She raised her gun at the prey and aimed. Once the prey was in sight, she pulled the trigger.</p>
