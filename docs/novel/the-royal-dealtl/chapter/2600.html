<p>“She works outside the main mansion. Bring her to me, I need her.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” Pon turned and left the office. He barked a short instruction to someone outside then returned to Amethyst to hear what else she had to say.</p>
<p>“Furthermore,” Amethyst said in a serious tone, “I want strict reinforcement for the punishment of any form of harassment. Sexual harassment in particular. I once saw a group of knights harassing a maid and it was this incident that Dajal used to soil my reputation.”</p>
<p>“I understand that Knight-Commander Sir Wheel has already dealt with the situation,” Pon said.</p>
<p>Amethyst raised an eyebrow, “Dealt with?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he suspended the knight and reduced his pay.”</p>
<p>“Then the punishment for dismissal will be enforced.”</p>
<p>“Dismissal?” Pon tilted his head in question, “But that may cause a severe backlash.”</p>
<p>“Among all forms of violence, sexual violation is one of, if not the most serious crime. It is lowly and despicable. Such acts will not be tolerated within the walls of this mansion,” Amethyst’s voice was stony, the weight of her words heavy in the air. “This is not a matter of right or wrong, it’s a matter of basic humanity and morality. Those that do not agree may leave.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madame. Understood,” Pon found he had to agree. Amethyst had a point.</p>
<p>“Regardless of status, staff or knights,” Amethyst continued, “if anyone is ever found harassing another who is in a weaker position, they will receive punishment that is swift and ruthless. Please see that this is known along with the welfare statement.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Pon asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>Pon shook his head, “No, Madame. I just assumed you would be delivering this news yourself. Wouldn’t that send a stronger message?”</p>
<p>“As you know, there are those who have seen me when I was disguised as a maid. Forgive me if I am hesitant to stand before them and act as the Lady of the House now. Just as there are those who think well of me, there are others who think otherwise. Anyway, I don’t fancy being a topic of gossip as the lady who wore a maid’s uniform,” she waved her hand to dismiss her other thoughts. “Even though I am certain they wouldn’t pass their comments in front of me.”</p>
<p>“My apologised for my oversight,” Pon dipped his head.</p>
<p>“And see to it that the rules apply to both genders. Punishment will be meted out to both men and women.”</p>
<p>“Excuse my ignorance, but women…?”</p>
<p>“Woman can harass men just as well as men can harass women. It’s called reverse discrimination,” Amethyst explained patiently.</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The heavier the penalty, the more mindful they will be of their actions. It is important to ensure we give them no reason to disobey,” Amethyst’s voice trailed off, “This will require more thought. I would like a sort of manual, a rulebook to be exact. Do we have anyone well-versed in such a field? I feel it would be good to hold regular talks and training as one of the prevention methods.”</p>
<p>“I will look into it,” Pon replied.</p>
<p>It was only once she’d finished speaking that Emelis realized Pon had taken out a notepad and pen and started jotting down all the things she’d said.</p>
<p>Their attention was drawn to the door when two stiff knocks echoed through the room. Emelis knew who it was.</p>
<p>“Roman, please come in!” she called.</p>
<p>Roman entered and stood at attention, “Yes, Madame? You called?”</p>
<p>“I have a favour to ask, do listen to it, please.” Amethyst said.</p>
<p>Roman gave a nod.</p>
<p>For the first time since she’d taken the position as Lady of the House, Amethyst’s office was occupied with a very human warmth. It was pleasant.</p>
<p>“Now that Roman is here,” she said, “I want to discuss the operations of the main and separate quarters. I no longer wish for them to operate separately.”</p>
<p>Roman nodded again. Pon scribbled away on his notepad.</p>
<p>“I also intend to draw up a schedule so that you work in groups. 5 members per group will be placed in different locations that are to be rotated every three months. I am sure everyone is familiar with the way things work. I don’t expect there to be any problems.”</p>
<p>Amethyst had been working for 10 years already. and even though this was a small company, she knew how to operate it efficiently. She picked up a piece of paper and started drawing up a plan.</p>
<p>“Madame,” Pon said, breaking his attentive silence, “you said every three months. May I ask why?”</p>
<p>“If you work in one area long enough you become lazy, complacent and incompetent,” Amethyst replied without looking up. “The ultimate goal is to make sure there is no confusion when it comes to the sudden absence of anyone. If someone is absent for a long period of time, whether the issues be health or personal, the vacancy must be filled to ensure maximum efficiency.”</p>
<p>Pon nodded then remember she wasn’t looking at him and replied with a respectful, “Understood, Madame.”</p>
<p>“I also want the members of the groups to be organized on a rotational basis. The same five group members cannot be grouped together too long. Yes, it will be complicated at first, but I am certain with time everyone will get used to it,” finally, she looked up.</p>
<p>Amethyst was met with the attentive eyes of the people before her, all waiting for what she would say next. “Lastly, I want to appoint a leader. No matter how strategically we split the groups and assign the people, there will always be problems. For this position of leader, Roman, I would like to appoint you,” Amethyst nodded at Roman.</p>
