<p>It didn’t take Alexcent long to notice the enthusiasm and excitement flowing in his household. He wasn’t immune to it, just like Pon, Gen and Lunia.</p>
<p>Gen and Pon, at the moment were waiting in the Duke’s office to provide a business report to the Duke. “Gen, how many did you get?” asked Pon.</p>
<p>“I got one today,” Gen said, “What about you?</p>
<p>“I have already completed the first five and got myself a bonus,” said Pon, proudly.</p>
<p>“Ugh, is it necessary to gloat?” said Gen, “I need to get a chance to meet the Duchess to even get the stamps. It’s unfair to me, I never see her as much as you.”</p>
<p>“I am not gloating,” Pon said, “But it’s nice to receive such praise and compliment. I thought it was silly and I was too old for this. But it feels very strange and pleasant.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, stop bragging, will you?” said Gen. He thought it was true though. When he first received the compliment board, he was indifferent to it. He though it was foolish to be treated like a child. But when he came across Amethyst in the hallway, she had praised him for his hard work and stamped his board. It had made him feel strangely happy. It had made him feel seen and appreciated. Now, it was all he could focus on. It also made him less grumpy these days.</p>
<p>Amidst their talk, the door to the office opened and Alexcent walked in. “What’s all the fuss?” he asked. After what happened in the training field with Amethyst, he had been in a very bad mood.</p>
<p>“Ah, nothing, Your Excellency,” said Pon, hurriedly.</p>
<p>“So, what’s in today’s report?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Nothing special,” replied Gen, “Almost the end of Congress, so everyone has been quiet.”</p>
<p>“Clearly not everyone,” said Alexcent, “What’s all this fuss in the household? It annoying. The whispers are never-ending. What in the world has happened that had made everyone so excited?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s…,” said Pon, and looked at Gen, uncertainly. “That’s because… the Duchess has held an event to boost employee morale.”</p>
<p>“What sort of event?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Yes,” continued Pon, “It’s a complimentary stamp system. If you do your job well, you receive a stamp. If you receive five stamps, you get a reward.”</p>
<p>“Hm,” said Alexcent, “a reward?”</p>
<p>“The first five stamps mean a 10 percent bonus,” said Pon, “Ten stamps mean a one-day paid vacation leave and so on.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so this is what the fuss is about,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Everybody in the household is participating, Your Excellency,” said Pon.</p>
<p>“Everyone? Even you?” asked Alexcent, surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Pon, “Me, Gen, Lunia, everyone.”</p>
<p>Gen gaped, shocked from having his name mentioned in something so petty of a game.</p>
<p>“Even Gen, huh?” asked Alexcent, eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>Gen broke into a cold sweat hearing his name uttered. “Your Excellency, I only received one stamp so far!” he said, hurriedly, “Pon had already received a bonus and he is waiting for one more stamp to be off on a vacation.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Gen!” exclaimed Pon, wide eyed.</p>
<p>“Give it to me,” said Alexcent, frowning.</p>
<p>“Sorry?” stammered Pon.</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Gen, at the same time.</p>
<p>They both looked at each other nervously. They had no intention of losing their cards, they still had many more stamps to receive!</p>
<p>“Give me that complimentary card or whatever you call it,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“No!” exclaimed Pon. Gen gaped at Pon’s boldness.</p>
<p>“Why not?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Because I need to receive just one more for a vacation,” said Pon, miserably.</p>
<p>“So, I can’t take yours and use it?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>Pon realized, with some surprise, that the Duke wanted one for his own, to earn the stickers. “It does not work that way,” he said, as he reluctantly took out his compliment board from his pocket and held it out to Alexcent.</p>
<p>“It’s specifically designed, and you put your name on it,” said Pon. He seemed to have taken very good care of the card as it was still new and shiny after being stamped nine times. The card was filled with ‘you did a great job’ stamps.</p>
<p>“Oh,” murmured Alexcent, “Where’s mine…”</p>
<p>Pon let out a sigh of relief as he was dismissed from the office. Fortunately, the Duke wasn’t very inclined on taking away his card, so he had it back. He felt bad for Gen who was still stuck in the office with the Duke. Well, there was nothing he could do about it. And Gen had betrayed him inside. <em>Let him suffer a little, </em>thought Pon with glee.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It was a very strange day. Leyrian stopped Amethyst before she left the field after sword practice.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Madam,” he called.</p>
<p>“Yes?” responded Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Uh… I just wanted to say… the Duke,” stammered Leyrian, “You did very well today, I just wanted to say that.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much, Sir Leyrian,” said Amethyst, gratefully, “You are a good teacher.”</p>
<p>As Amethyst entered the household, she came across Gen in the hallway. “Gen!” she called.</p>
<p>“Hello, Madam,” said Gen, cheerfully, “Haven’t seen you in a long while.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you too, Gen,” she said, “You look tired. Seems you have been having it tough.”</p>
<p>“Do I look that bad already?” laughed Gen.</p>
<p>“Take it easy, Gen!” she said, “You need to take care of your health.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” he said, “Thank you. I will. But…”</p>
<p>“Yes?” said Amethyst, urging Gen.</p>
<p>“The thing is, um,” said Gen, “Never mind. If you will excuse me….” Gen walked away.</p>
<p>Amethyst was confused. Clearly, Gen had something to say but thought better of it. Leyrian had been the same as well. <em>I wonder what is wrong, </em>she thought as she made her way back to her bedroom. Back in her bedroom, Lunia greeted her.</p>
<p>“Madam,” she said, “How was training today?”</p>
<p>“Ah, Lunia,” she said, “Thank you for asking. It was the same old. Posture correction again.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“But why have you been waiting for me,” she asked, “Is something the matter?”</p>
<p>“Well…,” trailed off Lunia.</p>
<p>“Everyone is being weird today,” she said, “So many people have approached me as though they have something to say, and then they falter and change the topic of conversation.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Lunia, hesitantly, “Everyone?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, “I can sense that they have a request, but they can’t say it. I didn’t press them thinking it might be a difficult request that they are having a hard time asking for.”</p>
<p>Lunia realized that she wasn’t the only one afraid of the wrath of the Duke, many, apparently, were dealing with the same thing and trying to convey it to the Duchess. There was a knock on the bedroom door.</p>
