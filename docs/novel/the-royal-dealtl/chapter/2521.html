            <p><strong>Chapter 147</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent felt anxious in his tent. He had been pacing since he got back. He had been so angry at that moment that he had gone overboard. He had sent her home crying. Her eyes had been so full of pure hatred when she had looked at him.</p>
<p>“Damn everything,” he swore. <em>Damn it, damn it! </em>He tried telling himself that it was her own fault for going against him. But he felt pathetic. He was angry at himself for his own behavior. And then he felt guilty for shouting at her. He felt guilty for humiliating her.</p>
<p>He felt a presence outside his tent. “Come in,” he said.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency,” said Count Glacia as she entered his tent. “Can you spare a bit of your time?”</p>
<p>“What is it?” he asked, briskly.</p>
<p>Count Glacia considered this to be her last chance. There was no one around. It was only her and the duke in the tent. She had heard that Lady Skad had followed the duke and set up camp beside the river close to the hunting grounds and the duke had been furious. He had looked terrifying when he returned to his tent. She had known that Lady Skad had been sent back. This was her chance to take advantage of the situation. Count Glacia took off her cape in the tent. She had worn a sensuous dress for just this moment.</p>
<p>Seeing Count Glacia did nothing but worsen his already glum mood. <em>Really? Trying to seduce me now at a moment like this… does she really think this is an opportunity? </em>Alexcent sighed wearily, rubbing the bridge of his nose.</p>
<p>Count Glacia walked towards him. “I heard you were alone,” she said, “I wanted to comfort you.”</p>
<p>“Comfort me?” said Alexcent with a mirthless chuckle.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Count Glacia. She stroked his forearm with a finger, trailing his blue veins till his rolled-up sleeves. “I thought you might need it.” her hands trailed up and rested on his chest.</p>
<p>“Need you really do that?” he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Let me comfort you,” she said as she brought her lips closer to his.</p>
<p>Alexcent grabbed the hand resting on his chest and grabbed hold of her hair with his other hand yanking her head away from his face. Count Glacia cried out in pain.</p>
<p>“Since when have our relationship reached a state of comforting each other?” he said, icily. He pulled at her hair roughly.</p>
<p>“It’s… it’s not like that!” she cried.</p>
<p>“Really?” said Alexcent, “Then what is this? Do you think you could comfort me? When have I ever given you that impression?” Alexcent let go off her roughly and she stumbled to the ground.</p>
<p>Count Glacia sobbed. She didn’t understand why she couldn’t be <em>the one </em>for him. She always looked at him with admiration, respect and love, and all she got in return were rejections and cold glares.</p>
<p>She had chosen a very wrong time for this. Alexcent’s rage that he was trying to suppress so badly was all directed towards the nearest target: Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“I have warned you before,” he said, “If you don’t want to lose everything you have worked so hard to earn, do not cross the line with me.” He glared at her. “I am sure you have found out by now about Dajal. Have you?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes,” said Count Glacia, tearfully.</p>
<p>The first thing she had done when she had arrived in the mansion was to find out about the whereabouts of Dajal. He had always been useful in carrying out her plans. When she had not found him, she had conducted her investigations to find out that he had died.</p>
<p>An accident, some had said. He had been drunk and rode the carriage off a cliff. But she knew better. Nobody knew about his death except her. Alexcent mentioning Dajal to Count Glacia was a clear warning. There won’t be forgiveness next time.</p>
<p>“Lady Skad is beyond that line as well, do you understand?” he said. “I said do you understand?!”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes, My Lord,” stammered Count Glacia as she looked up and met his furious eyes.</p>
<p>“Get out of my sight,” said Alexcent. She got up, grabbed her cape and hurried out of the tent.</p>
<p><em>How dare she! </em>Alexcent thought. He was filled with irritation and anger anew. <em>She dares to place her hand on my personage. </em>He had a bad feeling where Count Glacia’s hand had been. He thought about Amethyst.</p>
<p>He laughed. The thought of her always filled him either with rage or passion. Her sneaky plans, her stubbornness. She always had to go against him and test his patience. He wanted her right now. He shook his head. He had to control his urge to run back to her immediately.</p>
<p>A knight came looking for Alexcent at that moment. “Your Excellency,” said the knight.</p>
<p>“What?” barked back Alexcent.</p>
<p>“The Velacerovs has taken the bait,” said the knight.</p>
<p>“Just in time,” said Alexcent, with a sinister smile.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em><strong>Growwlll</strong></em></p>
<p>As Gen rode through the forest, he heard the roar of the beast echo all around him. <em>The hunt must already have started</em>. Gen steered the reins of the horse towards the source of the sound. He found the heads of the households and their knights already there.</p>
<p><em>A Velacerovs! </em>Gen thought. <em>Of all the beasts….</em></p>
<p>Velacerovs was a monster invincible against most magic swords. They were very large, and their shells were practically impenetrable. And the duke was there, fighting the beast with his bare hands.</p>
<p>The beast charged at the duke with its two sharp horns.</p>
<p>“When did it start?” asked Gen.</p>
<p>“Last night,” answered one of the knights.</p>
