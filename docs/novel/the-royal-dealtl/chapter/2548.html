            <p><strong>Chapter 120 – The Dance of Birds (2)</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst bit her lip. He was the last person she wanted to face right now. She needed time to gather her thoughts. “L-lock the door,” she stammered.</p>
<p>Roman nodded and locked the door from the inside. Shortly, there was a bang on the door. “Open the door,” said a low voice from outside.</p>
<p>“N-No,” managed Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Ash!” cried Alexcent. “Please.” Amethyst didn’t respond.</p>
<p>During the match, he had turned to look at where Amethyst had been seated. She wasn’t there any longer. She was gone. “Stop,” he declared.</p>
<p>Count Glacia stooped mid-swing, her sword in the air. Alexcent had walked up to Leyrian in quick strides.</p>
<p>“Where is she?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I am not sure what happened,” said Leyrian, hurriedly, “She was here and enjoying the match. Then her face turned really pale, she almost looked grey. She then stood up and ran so suddenly. I called after her, but she didn’t stop.”</p>
<p><em>Is she alright? Is it still the hangover? What if she is ill? </em>Alexcent’s eyes flashed with worry and concern. “Take good care of it,” said Alexcent as he handed the sword to Leyrian.</p>
<p>“Understood,” said Leyrian. Alexcent had already hurried back to the mansion.</p>
<p>“Ash…,” he said, “Open the door.” There was no response. “Now you won’t even let me into your room anymore?” Alexcent gritted his teeth. He just wanted to make sure she was fine. He would break the door down if he had to. He was just thinking whether he should, when the door opened and Lunia stepped out.</p>
<p>He heard the door close behind her. “Move,” he ordered.</p>
<p>“No,” said Lunia, momentarily forgetting who she actually served.</p>
<p>“Move or I will break down the door,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>His ferocity terrified her, but she held her ground. She was loyal to Amethyst and would do anything for her. “Madam sent me,” she said, “What did you do?”</p>
<p>“What?!” thundered Alexcent, “I didn’t do anything!” <em>I was only trying to help, </em>he thought.</p>
<p>“I am sure,” said Lunia, her tone skeptical.</p>
<p>“You dare,” began Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Madam has sent a message,” said Lunia, hurriedly, “Your meeting might be starting soon, my lord. So, she says you must get ready to attend it soon.”</p>
<p>“Is she alright?” he asked. If she didn’t want to see him, that was alright by him. But he needed to know she wasn’t ill or anything.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Lunia, confused. She thought he was angry at her, now he was worried.</p>
<p>“I heard she turned pale, and she just ran,” said Alexcent. “Will she be alright?”</p>
<p>Lunia thought that if she didn’t say something to assure him of Amethyst’ health, he might really break down the door and break her neck as well for standing in his way.</p>
<p>“She is not sick, she is alright now,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“So, it’s not the hangover that is still making her ill?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No,” said Lunia, “I think she just needs time to herself. So, please, my lord, go attend the meeting.”</p>
<p>Alexcent looked visibly relieved. He thought he still couldn’t rest easy until he saw her for himself and made sure she was indeed alright. But he had to take what he could get for now. Besides, he felt very disappointed and irritated that Amethyst had barred him from entering her room.</p>
<p><em>Fine, I will respect your wish, </em>he thought. He turned around and walked to his bedroom near Amethyst’ and slammed the door shut.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Finally, it seemed that it had gone quiet outside the door. Amethyst slumped down in relief. <em>He must have gone back. </em>She lay down on the bed and thought, <em>what should I do if it’s true? What if I really am just a bridge for them both?</em> She imagined Count Glacia and Alexcent together. She imagined them gazing fondly at each other. They looked good together. <em>Better than he looks with me. What do I really want? </em>Eventually, she felt tired and pulled the blanket over her and fell asleep.</p>
<p>“Mmm,” mumbled Amethyst. “What time is it?” She was groggy from sleep. She got out of her bed and looked out of the window. The sun was still up. She must have slept only a few hours.</p>
<p>“Roman?” she called.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam?” Roman said.</p>
<p>“I am hungry,” she said.</p>
<p>“I will get your meal,” said Roman and went out of her room. Before long, she arrived again with a plate of food and set it down on the table.</p>
<p>Amethyst ate with relish. She didn’t know she had been starving. She finished it in a few bites and paced around the room. She had passed her duties of guiding the ladies to town for shopping to Lunia. She now had a lot of time on her hands than she knew what to do with.</p>
<p>She wanted to take a walk, but she dreaded running into Alexcent if she even so much as stepped outside her room doors. She lay down on her sofa and stared at the ceiling. Her mind kept filling itself with nonsense thoughts and she tried to count the flowers on the ceiling decoration to distract herself.</p>
<p><em>Twenty-two, twenty-three…</em></p>
<p>“Madam,” said Roman.</p>
<p>“Yes?” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“You have a guest,” said Roman, visibly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“A guest?” Amethyst was surprised. <em>Who could it be? I am not expecting anyone, and the ladies will be at Newhenfield by now.</em></p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” said Roman, “It’s Count Glacia. She requests to see you.”</p>
<p>Amethyst sat up on the sofa. <em>Of all the people in the world… </em>She didn’t want to meet her, but it would be rude to refuse outright. She was a noble after all. Amethyst could ask Lunia if she was here on some advice but Lunia wasn’t here.</p>
<p>Amethyst walked to the adjoining reception room and straightened her attire. She indicated to Roman to escort Count Glacia into the reception room.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” asked Count Glacia as she appeared in the reception room following Roman.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amethyst, “Please take a seat.”</p>
