            <p><strong>Chapter 265</strong></p>
<p>“Wait here for a moment please,” the guard said, taking her ID and quickly disappearing into the palace.</p>
<p>Karune, the chief secretary of Empress Belice, was going over a report collected from the diplomats of the neighbouring countries. Now that Duke Skad was back, he did not have as much responsibility but he always wanted to keep up to date with the status of the surrounding countries.</p>
<p>There was a knock at his office door and another secretary stuck her head in. “Chief secretary, someone is requesting a meeting with you.”</p>
<p>Karune looked at his calendar. “I didn’t have an appointment scheduled for today.”</p>
<p>“I know, but the visitor said she needed to meet with you right away and asked to show you this.” The secretary handed him the ID card. Karune’s eyes opened in shock.</p>
<p>“This bears the royal seal!” he exclaimed. “Who was the person that brought this?”</p>
<p>“It was a young lady. Her name is on the card. I believe it’s Carol.”</p>
<p>To Karune’s knowledge, there was no one left that used that particular royal seal. The empress used the World Tree as she was basically the Goddess. Duke Skad had used this royal seal when he was a prince, but when he became Duke, he used a different seal. So why does some random young lady have this card? Karune took a closer look at the ID to make sure that it wasn’t forged.</p>
<p>The royal seal disappeared when looked at from a particular angle, so only the World Tree could be seen. There was no way one could sophisticatedly forge the magic that created that effect. The weight and texture of the card also felt correct. It was definitely real.</p>
<p>“Bring the lady in here now,” Karune instructed the secretary. He needed to find out who this woman was and how she came into possession of this card.</p>
<p>Karune was worried this stranger could be a threat to the Empress. The Empress was supposed to be the only female of royal blood in the Empire, and if that wasn’t true there could be a scandal.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Amethyst followed the secretary into the palace. She didn’t think she would be allowed in so quickly, figuring she would be waiting most of the day for the ID card to get into the right hands. The secretary had greeted her politely, even though she eyed the shabbiness of Amethyst’s clothes. Arriving at a door, the secretary knocked.</p>
<p>“Enter,” a voice called from within.</p>
<p>The secretary opened the door and indicated for Amethyst to enter. The office was richly furnished with a luxurious sofa, a mahogany table, and an ornate carpet. Karune stood up from his desk and indicated the chair in front.</p>
<p>“Please come in,” he said politely.</p>
<p>Karune watched Amethyst as she walked into the room and seated herself in the chair. As he went to sit back down, he almost fell over.</p>
<p>“You’re the Duchess Skad!” he exclaimed in shock.</p>
<p>Amethyst smiled as Karune recognized her. “I didn’t think I would be remembered after all of this time.”</p>
<p>“How can I forget the duchess.” It was one of the duties of the secretary for the Empress, memorizing faces. Karune had always been the best. Amethyst wasn’t surprised that he recognized her.</p>
<p>“I’m not the duchess anymore,” Amethyst said, smiling awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Why have you come looking for me?” Karune asked.</p>
<p>“Actually, I wanted to meet the Empress. But as you can see by the state I’m in…” Amethyst picked at her clothes in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“That’s why you said you wanted to meet me.” Amethyst could see the understanding in Karune’s face.</p>
<p>“Yes. But you weren’t easy to get an appointment with either. I should’ve just asked to meet the Empress, in the first place.”</p>
<p>Karune laughed out loud. “Her Majesty is taking a stroll right now. I know a good place for you two to chat where you won’t be seen. Come with me.” Karune stood and held the door open for her, waiting for her to follow.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The palace was quiet during this time of day. Belice was enjoying her stroll, having cleared her schedule for the first time in a while. Of course, whenever she had a moment to herself, Karune would show up.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” Karune greeted her, bowing.</p>
<p>“What is it now? You never seem to allow me to rest.”</p>
<p>“My apologies. But I have someone with me who you must meet right away. It was necessary for me to interrupt.”</p>
<p>“I thought I had no more appointments for today?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t. This arrival came as a surprise, but it is important you see her,” Karune said.</p>
<p>Belice sighed. It must be important if Karune came to find her. “All right. I’ll meet her in my office.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I’ll lead you to the private room the person is waiting in.”</p>
<p>“Private room?” This must be a really important meeting if it is being made in secret. She followed Karune and entered the chamber he led her to. Inside she saw the last face she had ever expected to.</p>
<p>“Greetings, Your Majesty. I hope you have been well,” Amethyst said, acknowledging Belice with a smile.</p>
<p>Belice paused, as she looked at Amethyst. Turning to Karune, Belice gave him an order. “Karune, don’t let anyone enter this chamber unless I say so. Also, make sure my schedule stays clear for the rest of the day.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” Karune left the room, closing the door behind him.</p>
