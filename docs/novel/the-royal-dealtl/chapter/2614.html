            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 59</strong></p>
<p>It occurred to Amethyst that if she were to falter in her fib here, it would be her neck on the chopping board. So, she let out one word calmly.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>How did he know? I didn’t go through his stuff. All I did was look through his files. And I placed them right back on the table… he must be more sensitive than I thought.</em></p>
<p>“I saw you entered my office.”</p>
<p>“Yes, to clean up.”</p>
<p>“Clean.” Dajal’s face turned a shade darker.</p>
<p><em>Have I been caught? How did he know that I had entered his office?</em></p>
<p>“Tsk, did you think getting rid of the dust with your rag would do the trick?”</p>
<p><em>What is that supposed to mean? I can’t tell if I’ve been caught or not. Is he testing me?… For now, let’s pretend like I have no idea.</em></p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Sir. Yesterday, you weren’t around so I took some shortcuts.” Amethyst spoke in the softest tone she could muster.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you know what happens if you don’t do  your work diligently….” His hawkish gaze was penetrating right to her bones.</p>
<p>“I-I am so sorry. Please forgive me this time. I will never do that again.”</p>
<p>“Fine. This time I will let you off but there won’t be a next time.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you.”</p>
<p><em>Am I off the hook? That’s a relief! But he seems a lot more sensitive than I thought, so I had better be careful.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst bowed her head and continued wiping the dust with her rag in front of Dajal. The suspicious gaze didn’t disappear and constantly followed her. Then as if reminded of something, his eyes widened and he smirked.</p>
<p>⤩</p>
<p>That afternoon, like any other day the maids were gathered at one place. Roman, Amethyst, and the other maids who knew her as Carol were all lined up in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>Dajal walked up and down and called out.</p>
<p>“Jane!”</p>
<p>The maid that was called out stepped forward.</p>
<p>“Carin!”</p>
<p>“Hebe!”</p>
<p>As Dajal swung the short, thin whip in his hand into the air, the leather tassels swung around dizzily.  The three maids must have known what was about to happen, as they were pale and shaking. The oblivious Amethyst simply stood in line like the rest.</p>
<p>“Do you know why you have been called out?” Dajal’s menacing tone rang in the air.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>As Dajal pointed the whip at the maid named Jane, she sobbed and finally mustered up an answer.</p>
<p>“Did you think you can just get away with it after doing such a crappy job cleaning?!”</p>
<p>“I am sorry.” Her sobs deepened.</p>
<p>“Yes, you should be sorry. Right?” Dajal tapped on Carin’s shoulder and spoke gently.</p>
<p>Carin’s face appeared unusually uncomfortable and flushed. Dajal was groping her chest with his arms around her shoulders. From behind it would appear as two people on good terms.  As he pinched her nipples and harassed her, Carin’s face expressed disgust, fear, and humiliation.</p>
<p>“Then what should I do? Hmm? Tell me.” Dajal smoothly withdrew his hand and lifted up her chin.</p>
<p>“I deserve… deserve to be punished.”</p>
<p>Dajal then moved over to Jane but not before pinching Carin’s bottom.</p>
<p>“Jane.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>As Dajal called on her, Jane’s two calmly folded hands started to tremble.</p>
<p>“Which type of punishment is the best fit?”</p>
<p>“…..!”</p>
<p>Jane stood frozen to the spot unable to answer.</p>
<p>Dajal lifted the whip and ran it across Jane’s lower abdomen. She then closed her eyes and moved her lips.</p>
<p>“As always… the punishment bestowed by Sir Dajal.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>With that, he lifted the whip high up.</p>
<p>“I…I am sorry.”</p>
<p>“I am sorry.”</p>
<p><em>Whip! Whip! Whip!</em></p>
<p>Even though there were loud sounds and clothes torn, the maids flinched momentarily before standing straight back up.</p>
<p>Amethyst’s eyes widened.</p>
<p><em>I need to stop it. I need to stop it…</em></p>
<p>But her body was frozen and didn’t listen to her. She who was already the recipient of his suspicion would be able to save them for now if she stepped in, but she wouldn’t be able to get rid of him entirely. There was no choice since she had gathered no proof. If Dajal insisted that he was punishing them for doing a poor job cleaning, then there was no other way to argue back.</p>
<p><em>Right now this is probably a warning to me.</em></p>
<p>“Sorry? Because of you, do you know how much discomfort you’ve caused to the Lady of the House? Because of you I was reprimanded by her.”</p>
<p><em>Whip!</em></p>
<p>Once again the sound of the whip filled the room.</p>
<p>“I… will make… sure not to let it happen… again.”</p>
<p>“That’s a given! But based on what you’ve said you deserve to be punished!”</p>
<p>“Please forgive… Aghhh!”</p>
<p>Even before the maid could beg for forgiveness, Dajal whipped her again.</p>
<p><em>How dare he… use my name! </em>Amethyst ground her teeth.</p>
