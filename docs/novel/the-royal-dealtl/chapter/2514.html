            <p><strong>Chapter 154</strong></p>
<p>“Even so, you said your child is sick,” said Amethyst, “How bad is it?”</p>
<p>“It is not very bad. She has a slight fever, but I couldn’t really leave her at home,” said the maid, “I apologize. I will complete all my task diligently and will not inconvenience anyone.”</p>
<p>Some maids in the mansion were given accommodation in the mansion but some, who had families of their own, lived outside. They came to work in the morning and left at the end of the day.</p>
<p>“Do Roman and Pon know about this?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“No,” said the maid, “I have not told anybody. I only had tasks in the garden, so I brought her with me. I didn’t know you would be out on a walk because the weather seemed bad. Please madam, please don’t tell anyone of this. I will be chased out of here. I can’t afford to lose this job. Please.”</p>
<p>If Roman or Pon knew about this, the most they could do would be to let her take the day off. The maid must have realized this because she looked at Amethyst apprehensively.</p>
<p>“This is exactly why I made the group rotation for tasks…,” Amethyst mumbled to herself.</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“If this happens again, just take the day off,” said Amethyst, “It’s alright to take the day off, the mansion will manage.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it and go and take care of your baby for today,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“But I need to finish the tasks assigned to me,” said the maid.</p>
<p>“The child is suffering,” said Amethyst, “Drop by an infirmary on your way back. Get some medicines for the child. Don’t worry about your tasks until the baby recovers. Go now.”</p>
<p>“But madam…”</p>
<p>“I will handle things with Roman and Pon, so don’t worry,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“T-Thank you, madam,” said the maid. “Thank you so much.”</p>
<p>The maid’s face brightened with relief. Amethyst looked at the baby. The baby’s cheek was covered with tears and mucus. The child had just stopped crying. She looked flushed.</p>
<p>“Can I carry her for a second?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“She looks so cute, and I am concerned that she is crying again.” Amethyst didn’t know why she felt sympathetic towards this baby. <em>Maybe I feel bad because she is sick. </em>“It’s is absolutely alright if you don’t want me to.”</p>
<p>“No,” said the maid, “Of course you can carry her.” The maid walked towards her and passed the child into her arms. The baby didn’t seem to mind the arms of a stranger because she wasn’t crying in Amethyst’s arms. Amethyst rocked the child gently.</p>
<p>“Good girl,” she cooed. The baby’s smell made her feel nostalgic. “She is so sweet.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the maid, smiling, “She is not very well, otherwise, she is always smiling.”</p>
<p>“She is pretty just like her mother,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>The maid blushed at the compliment. The baby had inherited her light brown hair and blue eyes. “Thank you,” said the maid, “Is she heavy?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” said Amethyst, “You said she had a fever?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the maid, “I did give her some medicine, but the fever isn’t going down.”</p>
<p>“For babies with fever, it is important to cool them down,” said Amethyst, “Layering clothes will trap the heat and make it harder for their body temperature to go down. During the night, use lukewarm water instead of cold water to wipe them to bring down the body temperature. And don’t keep the room too dry, try to make it humid by placing wet towels around the room.”</p>
<p>The maid looked at Amethyst. “How do you know so much about babies, madam?” asked the maid.</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have a child yet,” said the maid, “but you seem to know so much more than I do…”</p>
<p><em>Oh dear, I must have gone overboard, </em>realized Amethyst. “Oh, that’s because…,” stammered Amethyst, “I had younger siblings. I had to help my mum to take care of them when they were sick.”</p>
<p>“Your mum?” asked the maid, confused.</p>
<p>Amethyst realized that she had said something wrong. <em>I seem to be going down the rabbit hole of lies and doing it very badly. </em>Amethyst passed the child gently back to the maid and tried to change the conversation.</p>
<p>“You should take the child and go home quickly before her condition worsens,” said Amethyst, “Quick!”</p>
<p>That seemed to distract the maid. “Ah, yes madam,” said the maid, “Thank you so much. I will get going.”</p>
<p>“Don’t forget to drop by the infirmary,” reminded Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said the maid, walking away.</p>
<p>“Wait!” called Amethyst.</p>
<p>The maid stopped and turned around. “Yes madam?”</p>
<p>“There might be many more days that might be rougher than today,” said Amethyst, “Just don’t give up.”</p>
<p>The maid smiled. “Thank you, madam.”</p>
<p>“Stay strong,” said Amethyst, “Now get going!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam. Thank you.” The maid bowed and left.</p>
<p>Amethyst stood there and looked at the spot for a long time. After leaving the maze-like garden, this open spot had helped her breathe. The child crying and the scent that lingered in the air. She looked down at her own hands that had carried the child.</p>
<p>She sighed and looked up at the sky. Everything felt like a sign. As though, everything was telling her that she had to go back soon…</p>
<p><em>I wonder what’s the problem. Why do I feel sad? </em>Amethyst wondered. <em>Is it because of that sick baby? The nostalgia? Or is it because I have to leave him behind?</em></p>
<p>Unable to understand her own feelings, she felt frustrated and suffocated. She turned back to look at the path where she had just walked. She was bitter that she felt so alone again. Just then, tiny droplets of rain began pelting down. Shortly, the rain was pouring down and soaking her. Amethyst didn’t try to avoid it. The coolness of the rain calmed her. Getting soaked in the rain and the maid reminded her of something from the past.</p>
<p>When she was young, she would sneak out of the house without telling her mother and play in the rain, getting soaked. The entire aisle would be empty because everyone would be inside avoiding the rain. The world felt like it was only hers right then.</p>
