            <p><strong>Chapter 131</strong></p>
<p><em>I have an idea! </em>Thought Amethyst. <em>I can do it like that movie! </em>A smile appeared on her face. <em>I can prepare it in that way. It doesn’t even take much time!</em> <em>And it will be so mysterious.</em></p>
<p>“Lunia,” she said, “I have an idea.”</p>
<p>“Do tell,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“The invites have been sent out already, right?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then can you prepare as many masks as the invites?” said Amethyst, “make them all identical.”</p>
<p>“Of course, but masks?” asked Lunia.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Amethyst, “Remember that they all need to be identical. No need to make them to cover the entire face, just the eyes and the nose. Mass producing masks with same design shouldn’t be difficult.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Lunia, “What do you intend to do with so many masks?”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Amethyst, “I intend to distribute them to all the nobles who attend the ball. It will be a pre-requisite of attending the ball so they will be handed a mask from the time they reach here and get out of their carriage. Have everyone informed that they would have to wear the mask or they won’t be allowed an entry to the ballroom.”</p>
<p>“We are seriously going to do it?” asked Lunia.</p>
<p>“Yes!” said Amethyst, “Wouldn’t it be fun? Nobody will recognize the other because everyone will be wearing the same kind of mask. Wouldn’t it be thrilling to not know who you are dancing with?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think people will be fooled,” said Lunia, “They can still recognize their partners even if part of their faces is covered.”</p>
<p><em>Well, true, they might recognize their partners, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>but not everybody. I wonder if they will fight because of it or fall for another. </em>Amethyst played with various possibilities in her head happily. <em>There is no way I wouldn’t recognize Alec. But if Alec doesn’t recognize me then perhaps, I can trick him into letting me join the hunting match. </em>Amethyst laughed aloud.</p>
<p>“It seems like you have become similar to the duke in mind games,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound like a compliment,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“It is,” said Lunia, smiling.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem so,” said Amethyst, aghast.</p>
<p>“It is!” insisted Lunia.</p>
<p>Amethyst stared at her with disbelief but Lunia cleared her throat and changed the topic of their discussion. “Then I will make the arrangements and have the masks prepared,” she said, “Is there a color that you want the masks to be?”</p>
<p>“Black!” said Amethyst. “It should be black.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The meetings continued and while Alexcent was busy handling them, Amethyst spent her time with the other ladies, inviting them for tea or taking a stroll in the garden. Her schedule was manageable.</p>
<p>The days passed in the same manner and the meetings came to a halt after the conflicts and discussions had been resolved. Thanks to Amethyst who had contributed her idea for the biggest problem of them all, the meetings ended earlier than the previous years. A few days later, it was time for the much-awaited ball.</p>
<p>On the fateful day, the ladies didn’t step out of their rooms in preparation for the event. Amethyst, too, got up early in the morning in preparation for the busy day ahead. Roman and Lunia were diligently helping her get ready for the big event.</p>
<p>Amethyst was just about done with her bath and massage and was just donning the bathrobe when a maid knocked and rushed inside her room.</p>
<p>“Madam!” cried the maid, “There is a problem.”</p>
<p>Amethyst wondered what had happened that required the maid to react so dramatically. “What’s wrong?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It’s…,” stammered the maid, “It’s count Glacia’s dress….”</p>
<p><em>Count Glacia again! She has been quiet for a few days. I knew the peace wouldn’t last. What has she done now? </em>Amethyst felt very uneasy.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with her dress?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Her dress is red in color,” said the maid.</p>
<p>“What?!” Lunia exclaimed. It even startled Amethyst. “Are you sure? Is this information credible?” asked Lunia.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the maid, shrinking at Lunia’s stern voice. “Even the design is the same as the Lady Skad’s.”</p>
<p><em>Honestly, she is trying just too hard, </em>mused Amethyst. <em>First the baby’s breath. Second, provoking me regarding separate rooms that I and Alexcent used. And now, this.</em> Amethyst had suspected for a while now that there was a spy among them who worked for Count Glacia. <em>Roman and Lunia would never do something like that. It has to be some other maid.</em></p>
<p>“Madam, what should we do about the dress?” asked Roman bringing her out of her thoughts.</p>
<p><em>I need to take care of the problem at hand first, </em>decided Amethyst. There wasn’t much time left. She only had a few hours. If she wore the same dress, others would start comparing them. She was the Lady of the house. <em>It would be like those pictures on the internet with celebrities wearing the same clothes but looking so different. One would always look better than the other. And since it would be the ex-mistress and the current wife, it would invite too many gossips and far too bothersome rumors.</em></p>
<p>Count Glacia was beautiful and she could pull off anything she wore so elegantly. Amethyst knew that she looked average when compared with her. If they emerge wearing the same dress for the ball, she wouldn’t be able to make her own statement. Besides, she didn’t want to let Count Glacia win at any cost. And she wanted to enjoy this ball for a change.</p>
<p>“Madam, there isn’t much time.,” said Lunia, “You must decide fast.”</p>
<p>It was too late to prepare another dress. None of her attires were fit for the ball as Amethyst usually preferred casual attires. <em>What should I do? </em>Amethyst worried.</p>
<p>“Roman,” said Lunia, “Go choose the fanciest gown that you find in Madam’s wardrobe. There is bound to be one that looks good.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Roman and hurried to the wardrobe.</p>
<p>“Wait!” said Amethyst. Everyone stopped in their tracks. “You three!” she said to the three other maids that were in the room. “Please go outside the mansion and find me a suitable dress. I will reward the one who finds it with a bonus. Make sure the color is anything other than red.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” intoned the maids and left in a hurry.</p>
