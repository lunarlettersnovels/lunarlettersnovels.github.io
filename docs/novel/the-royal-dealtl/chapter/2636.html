            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 37 – An Unplanned S3duction (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p>He was right. She may have promised herself that she would live doing whatever she liked, but there was a boundary that she shouldn’t cross. And now that she was the wife of the prince, her rank was higher than that of a noble lady.</p>
<p>Amethyst tried to appease him as she studied his darkened expression.</p>
<p>“Alec, I’ll be careful from now on.”</p>
<p>“And if you are going to s3duce anyone, it’ll only be me.”</p>
<p>“What? What do you mean, s3duce? The undergarments were so suffocating I—hmm!”</p>
<p>Alexcent swallowed her excuses by blocking her mouth with his lips. He bit on her fleshy lips and pushed his t0ngue inside. Her tongue drew back in surprise but as the thrilling sensation spread, she responded passionately by wrapping her t0ngue around his.</p>
<p>Once he was assured of her consent, Alexcent placed his hand on her breasts.</p>
<p>As he felt the soft sensation of the bre@sts beneath the silky dress with his hands, he felt ar0used.</p>
<p>He dived in, fondling her bre@sts as she breathed roughly, his lips traced her neck where he could feel her heartbeat, then slid down her collar to her bre@sts. He opened his mouth and sucked on her bre@st over the dress.</p>
<p>As Amethyst felt his lips and tongue through the dress, she held back her breath.</p>
<p>“Hmm! Ale…lec!”</p>
<p>As she had been wearing nothing beneath her dress, she ended up inevitably wetting it. She felt foolish for beating herself up this morning for enjoying this sensation last night.</p>
<p><em>This must be why people can’t get over addictions easily. Everything about him was as sweet as a drug.</em></p>
<p>With his large hands, Alexcent swiped everything away from the bed.</p>
<p><strong>Crash!</strong></p>
<p>Along with the sound of something breaking, all the items fell to the floor. He lay Amethyst down on the bed and was about to get a good taste of her.</p>
<p>“Alec…it’s only noon.”</p>
<p>“It’s already too late.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>His hand moved down to her centre. As he felt her wet dress, he spoke. “You’re dripping something as delicious as this and yet you deny seducing me.”</p>
<p>“Well, no this is….hmmm!”</p>
<p>He quickly raised her dress and inserted his finger. Feeling the wetness, he rubbed her with his large hand and soon she became intoxicated by the touch of him. The temptation of lu$t was irresistible to her as she had already tasted it once.</p>
<p>At first it was difficult, but afterwards she succumbed to it so easily. Unlike her rational mind, her instincts were unsatisfied with just his hand. As she desired more sensation, she lifted her hips up against his hand and moved her hips.</p>
<p>Alec too was at his limit.</p>
<p>The moment he had entered the bedroom and set his eyes on her, he had felt the tightness in his pants. He recalled her supple skin and the softness of it. Then as his eyes fell on her exposed bre@sts, he felt himself aroused beyond words.</p>
<p>Alexcent’s lips stayed connected to hers while his hands desperately ripped away at his clothes. He undid his belt, pulled down his pants, threw away his tie that had been suffocating his neck, undid his buttons and lastly took off his shirt.</p>
<p>Amethyst wrapped her arms around his neck and clung onto him. As he felt the heat of his arousal, his hands felt her bare skin.</p>
<p>“Mmmm….”</p>
<p>“As….sh.”</p>
<p>His voice, mixed in with the sound of his breath, sounded desperate. He who couldn’t hold himself back any longer, approached her centre. It seemed like he had long lost his rationale.</p>
<p>As he was about to enter her, he heard Amethyst’s voice.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>He looked up in surprise with his stiff body and wondered if she was rejecting him.</p>
<p>“Not….yet. A bit more….”</p>
<p>She needed more. his display of affection had made her feel like she was on cloud nine and made her forget everything. Making her believe that she was the real Amethyst.</p>
<p>She didn’t want s3x that ended with just thrusting like with Heeyeon’s husband, but the kind of affectionate and adoring sex that Amethyst’s husband, Alexcent gave.</p>
<p>Alexcent who had thought he was being rejected, smiled as she said ‘more.’</p>
<p>“Of course, as much as you want.” Alexcent pecked her on the lip and buried his face in between her legs. He brought his desire to his lips. Starting with a short kiss, he stayed for a long and slow time. As she felt his hot breathing tingle her skin, she shuddered in pleasure.</p>
<p>She combed her fingers through his hair and bit her lip to stop herself from moaning out loud.</p>
<p>“Ha…ah…please!”</p>
<p>His tongue was soft and yet firm, sharp and yet gentle. His continuous licking and movement of his tongue drove Amethyst into a blissful org@sm. As the feeling of ecstasy tickled her entire body, her centre started dripping. His sweat, her liquid, wet the bed sheet.</p>
<p>When she saw her ready for him, Alec inserted himself with a groan. His pace was unhurried, however, it escalated to a deep and brutal penetration as the minute grew. Hence, Amethyst found herself chasing after her breath, her walls squeezing his length, driving him to insanity.</p>
<p>Their love making which had started in broad daylight, came to an end in the late hours of the night. As they cooled off the heat, Alexcent lay next to Amethyst and lovingly held her in his arms as they fell asleep together.</p>
