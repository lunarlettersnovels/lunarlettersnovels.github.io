            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 42 – A Doting Husband (1)</strong></p>
<p>“Yes. It’s not productive and it feels like you’re meaninglessly wasting time.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe the audacity of the man before her. He had actually answered. And that too, so truthfully, without fear of her bashing his head in. Maybe he didn’t even realize that she was mad. She was so surprised that she actually calmed down.</p>
<p>“Bloody hell! Are you possessed by a workaholic ghost or something? I mean how can someone work all the time?”</p>
<p>“Workaholic?”</p>
<p>“Yes! You should rest when you are resting and work when you are working to increase efficiency. If people work like you, they will never be able to date their entire life and die alone! Now tell me honestly.” She leaned closer to him in curiosity. “Have you ever dated anyone before?”</p>
<p>“Why would I do such a thing?”</p>
<p>She fell back in the chair, her eyebrows raised and mouth open in shock. “Wow. Look at you…no wonder you’ve never dated anyone and gotten yourself into a contract marriage. You’re a soloist.”</p>
<p>“What? Soloist? What is that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“Solo! Someone who’s never dated since they were born.”</p>
<p>Alexcent tilted his head and spoke as if it was bothersome. “Amethyst, I don’t have to do something as frivolous as dating. I am enough as I am.”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes at him. The ideal guy who had it all; looks, brains, or wealth. He didn’t need to try to look good for a woman, or ask someone on a date. He was a perfect guy and women fell at his feet no matter where he was. And the worst part was, he was well aware of it.</p>
<p><em>‘Those who are pretty, always know they are.’</em></p>
<p>“What an eyesore.” She mumbled beneath her breath and went back to her cake.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I said, the cake is delicious.” She said and brought the fork to her lips, so she wouldn’t have to speak anymore.</p>
<p>After they were out of the café, she dragged Alec around the streets of Newhenfield, and went through almost every shop until he had had enough.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Go!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>After almost shoving Amethyst into the carriage, Alexcent ordered the coachman to move. Amethyst too was slightly tired. She had been devious and had done her best to annoy him, feeling satisfied as she saw his expressions turn into a deeper grimace. But once she was seated in the carriage, she realized how numb her feet and legs were. She m0aned in pain as she felt the heat and s0reness in her feet.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>She considered not telling him, not wanting to admit that her venture had tired her too, but quickly gave in.</p>
<p>“My feet hurt. I guess I walked too much today.”</p>
<p>“Tsk, I told you to take it easy.”</p>
<p>While Alexcent clicked his tongue and rebuked her, Amethyst fought the urge to poke her tongue out at him. The carriage came to a stop at the entrance of the mansion and Alexcent descended first. Amethyst went to follow suit when he lifted her up in his arms and carried her inside.</p>
<p>“Ah! Alec!”</p>
<p>“Stop moving. Didn’t you say your feet hurt?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I can still walk on my own!”</p>
<p>“Stay still or I will drop you.”</p>
<p>Even though he spoke harshly, she knew he would never do it. She wrapped her arms around his neck and stopped squirming.</p>
<p>“If you drop me, I will kick your butt.”</p>
<p>“What!” He looked down at her in shock. “If you do that, I will sp@nk you.”</p>
<p>“Then I will hit you until my handprint is on your back.”</p>
<p>“Really? I will pinch your cheeks and shake your head.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare! I will…”</p>
<p>“Welcome back”</p>
<p>As Pon approached and greeted them politely, Amethyst’s flushed with embarrassment. But Pon didn’t seem to notice and greeted them naturally with a carefree face.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, it’s a little late but should I still ask them to prepare dinner?”</p>
<p>At Pon’s question, Alexcent looked towards Amethyst, asking her opinion in silence. Amethyst who was still in his arms, shook her head and spoke.</p>
<p>“No. I ate so much just now, I’m not hungry.”</p>
<p>“Neither am I. Just bring me some hot water and towels.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Alexcent entered the bedroom, and placed her down gently on the bed. There was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>“I’ve brought the hot water and towel you asked for.”</p>
<p>“Leave it here and go.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness”</p>
<p>As instructed, the maids placed the basin of steaming warm water and clean towels on the table and left. Alexcent then brought the items to the bed and sat close to Amethyst. He then bent his knee and grabbed a hold of her foot hidden beneath her dress. Taking off her heels, his hands rose to her th!ghs to take off her stockings. Goosebumps rose on her skin and her hands bunched up her dress.</p>
<p>“Alec…what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Hold still.”</p>
<p>At those words, Amethyst froze and simply watched him. Following his gentle movement, her stockings slowly descended her thighs and revealed her bare skin, showing her reddish little toe and slightly swollen feet.</p>
<p>Alexcent let out a low sigh as he picked up the clean towel, wet it in hot water and wrapped it around her feet. Perhaps it was due to the warmth or the gentleness of his gesture, but she closed her eyes and relaxed as his hand massaged her feet over the hot towel.</p>
<p>“Where did you learn to do something like this?”</p>
<p>“During battle. There are times when your feet swell after a long march. How do you feel now?”</p>
<p>“It hurts less than before.”</p>
<p>“That’s a relief.”</p>
