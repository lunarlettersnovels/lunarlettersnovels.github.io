            <p><strong>Chapter 188</strong></p>
<p>As usual Hill, Leyrian, Buer, Marcus and Barden were there.</p>
<p>“Wow, even Barden is here.”</p>
<p>“If he’s at the mansion, he needs to have his welcoming ceremony!”</p>
<p>“Welcoming ceremony?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Apparently he hasn’t had grilled intestines before.”</p>
<p>“Really? This amazing stuff?! Barden you’ve truly not lived.” Amethyst said to the flustered Barden.</p>
<p>“What? My lady, have you had this disgusting looking stuff before?” The fellow asked in surprise.</p>
<p>“Ha, look at this lad,” said Buer, chuckling. “Our lady can’t have enough it! She loves it so much.”</p>
<p>“What?!” asked Barden, perplexed.</p>
<p>“Haha, Barden once you try it you won’t be able to get over this dish!”</p>
<p>“Tada, I brought some alcohol to go along as well!” Marcus revealed a bottle from his arms and shook it.</p>
<p>“My man! You sure know how to enjoy!” Buer wrapped his arms around Marcus’ shoulders in excitement.</p>
<p>Amethyst clapped her hands and cheered as well. “Now hurry and flip it! Be careful, don’t burn it.”</p>
<p>“Haha, don’t worry, my lady. We have mastered the art of grilling, thanks to you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, don’t forget to grill the onion! And the potatoes!”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Leyrian quickly put the vegetables on the grill.</p>
<p>Just as the intestines were turning golden brown, Marcus opened the bottle of alcohol and poured everyone a glass. Amethyst took this as the opportunity and grabbed a glass for herself.</p>
<p>“Now, cheers!”</p>
<p>“Cheers!”</p>
<p><em>How exciting! It’s been a while, </em>thought Amethyst. She knew that her current body was low on tolerance when it came to alcohol. So, instead of gulping the whole thing up, she sipped at it. But even with such a small amount, she got tipsy after a while. She felt great. Her body felt light. She was full of energy.</p>
<p>“One shot!”</p>
<p>“Madam you can’t even down your first glass!”</p>
<p>“Haha, count me out! I’m already quite drunk already!”</p>
<p>“Alright, just this once!”</p>
<p>“Yes! Now, cheers!” The food was cooking, and the atmosphere was cheery.</p>
<p>Alexcent spotted Pon the moment he returned. Pon looked worried. “What is it?” asked the duke.</p>
<p>“Ah… it’s nothing, my lord,” said Pon.</p>
<p>Alexcent was about to turn and head to his study when Roman came looking for Pon. “Pon!” she called and then she saw Alexcent, “My lord.” She bowed.</p>
<p>“You are Ash’s maid, aren’t you?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you here?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Sorry?” asked Roman, confused.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you be by her side?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“I was just running an errand…”</p>
<p>“An errand?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
<p>“You have a skill of making me ask twice. I don’t quite like that.”</p>
<p>“I-I apologize, my lord,” said Roman, terrified. “Madam asked me to get some more liquor from Pon, my lord.”</p>
<p>Pon looked nervous. With Roman, blurting out everything, he thought that the damage had already been done.</p>
<p>“Liquor?” asked Alexcent. He turned to Pon. “Why is that, Pon?”</p>
<p>“They are having a mini party in the training ground, my lord,” said Pon, hurriedly, “With grilled meat and some alcohol. I think they much be low on the latter.”</p>
<p>Roman looked at Pon. Pon swallowed his nervousness. “I apologize, my lord,” said Roman.</p>
<p>“Lead the way,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord.” Roman led the way to the training grounds, terrified.</p>
<p><em>Alcohol! </em>Alexcent seethed. <em>She can’t hold her liquor and yet…. </em>Even though Alexcent had promised himself that he wouldn’t care about her too much, the word ‘alcohol’ broke his resolve. Because he knew better than anyone else how she had the lowest tolerance for it. With every step he took towards the training ground, he felt his rage growing within him.</p>
<p>“Drink, drink!”</p>
<p>“Drink what? We’re out of alcohol!” Marcus complained.</p>
<p>“Haha, don’t worry. Roman will be back shortly with more!”</p>
<p>“My lady! you are so generous!”</p>
<p>“While we wait, why don’t we play a game of truth or dare?” Lunia, who had joined them just a moment ago, suggested. She should have been stopping Amethyst, but here she was, encouraging her instead.</p>
<p>“Truth or dare? That sounds fun. Who’s going to go first?”</p>
<p>“Barden of course!” Leyrian and Buer shouted at the same time.</p>
<p>Barden tried to refuse but it was too late.</p>
<p>“Now, now, if you refuse to question, you will have to drink a whole glass!”</p>
<p>“What the hell? Since when was that rule created?”</p>
<p>“Just now!”</p>
<p><em>This is so fun! </em>Amethyst laughed as she sipped on her glass.</p>
<p>“Now, tell me honestly. Who’s the one you moon over every day?” Buer asked with a smirk.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p><em>Oh my, how did they know that? </em>Amethyst almost spilled her drink. She looked at Lunia, who shrugged her shoulders. <em>Haha. Sorry, Barden.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst looked away as Barden looked at her with resentful eyes.</p>
<p>“Are you going to drink? Or tell the truth?”</p>
<p>“Well…” Barden, who couldn’t drink, seemed to be in a dilemma.</p>
<p><em>Oh no, should I help him out? But I can’t drink as well. What should I do? I can’t believe Lunia did that! She promised to keep it a secret!</em></p>
<p>“This won’t do. Fill the glass! Two times!” Marcus emptied the bottle; the glass was full.</p>
<p>“You might die if you drink this. You better tell us. It’s quite strong.”</p>
<p>“Hey and you never know, we might be able to help you out. Even though he looks like that, Leyrian is pretty popular with the ladies.” Buer leaned into Barden and whispered devilishly, trying to get him to spill the beans.</p>
<p>Barden must have been nervous. “Well… the person I like is… Lo—”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” A furious voice boomed in the air. It felt like a thunderclap that shook everyone sending cold shivers down their spine.</p>
