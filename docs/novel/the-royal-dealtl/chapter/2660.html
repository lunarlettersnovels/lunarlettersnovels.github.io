            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 13 – Finding Lady Lohikin</strong></p>
<p>“Pfft, Froy you don’t seem to trust your cousin very much.” Amethyst remarked teasingly.</p>
<p>“Well, he’s such a clumsy fellow, that it’s questionable how he became a disciple, in the first place. Anyway, the world tree stands for the empire and is also the royal emblem; the Empress’s seal carries this sign. ”</p>
<p>She suddenly recalled Yellie mentioning an invitation from the palace and catching a glimpse of the emblem.</p>
<p>“Oh! I received an invitation from the palace sometime ago, so that tree on the seal was the world tree!”</p>
<p>“Ah yes! You must be referring to the commemoration party for the completion of the Belecian palace. That’s right. There are only two royal families that use an emblem of the world tree. The Roden household and the Skad household.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>On the night of the Commemoration party, people were in awe of the Belecian palace as they went in, remarking that it was a perfect embodiment of the Empress’s strength and spirit.</p>
<p>It apparently was the best of all the palaces built by former Emperors; people took pride in its significance of how rich and powerful the Sehar empire currently was.</p>
<p><em>‘This palace really is beautiful… I’ve never seen any other architecture this grand. I wonder if the jewels there are real? They must be, it’s the Empress’s palace, after all.</em>’</p>
<p>The banquet was held in the Highlander hall, supported by marble columns, and decorated with cream-colored ivory decorations. To add to the splendour, the walls were decorated with gold and jewels. The high ceiling reflected dazzling lights, enhanced by a wizard’s barrier buff, infinitely like the Milky Way.</p>
<p>The Empress’s love for flowers was evident in the decorations; flowers of the most beautiful shades, of various shapes and sizes adorned the hall, adding their own unique fragrances to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Amethyst, who had never seen such grandeur and splendour in her life, began to feel self-conscious of her dress, that was far too ordinary for such an elite gathering.</p>
<p><em>‘I should have dressed up a bit more. No, not for myself, god knows there’s nothing in this party for me, but to keep up the Count’s reputation. I am here as his daughter, after all. Maybe the make-up will pass, but the dress will surely draw glances, and not the admiring kind.’</em></p>
<p>She felt small amongst the other young ladies, who were dolled-up for the occasion and rightly so, for she was dressed in a plain cream-white, square-necked chiffon dress, with flute sleeves. A green ribbon encircling her slim waist, accentuated her slender physique and was the only accessory she wore.</p>
<p>She had deliberately chosen a modest dress to not attract attention towards herself, but it seemed that she had failed miserably in her attempt.</p>
<p>Everywhere she looked, people, it seemed, were whispering about her inadequate dressing for such an important official event.</p>
<p>She conceded that they were right and consoled herself. ‘<em>Don’t think about it anymore. It’s too late to do anything now. This event is not hosted for me, after all. Once, the Empress enters, they’ll forget all about me.’</em></p>
<p>She sighed deeply. <em>I guess there’s no other choice but to stay quietly for a while and then leave.</em></p>
<p>Emelis smiled awkwardly and started to walk away, towards a corner of the banquet hall. Thankfully, people quickly lost interest in her.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>A little while later, she was glad she had moved. Snuggled in a corner, she checked out the men in the party, grinning like Cheshire Cats.</p>
<p><em>‘Wow. This is like a gathering of all the beautiful people in the Empire. Were all the men in this world this handsome? I’m so glad I came here tonight. What a treat for my eyes!’</em></p>
<p>Amethyst gauged them in great detail.</p>
<p><em>‘He looks like he’s meant to be a singer with that deep voice and gorgeous face. Wow! That guy has an amazing physique, he should certainly be a choreographer.’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Mmm…This one definitely looks like the lead singer of a boy-band. He’s not exactly handsome but has his own roguish charm, better than the leader of the idol group on MTV that’s been around for years!’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Oh yes! That girl has character…You can tell from one look at her face. She’s like an actress who’s been through all sorts of hardship; she just stands out.’</em></p>
<p>The event turned out surprisingly fun. Emelis was enjoying herself, grinning from ear to ear when she heard the announcement of the Empress’s entrance indicating the official commencement of the party.</p>
<p>“Your majesty the Empress, Belice Frostin.”</p>
<p>“Followed by Duke Alexcent Frostin du Skad and Duke Michen Mui Roden.”</p>
<p>All eyes were fixed on the Empress Belice, the Duke of Skad, and the Duke of Roden. Everyone turned and knelt to greet them, their voices ringing out in unison.</p>
<p>“May the glory of the great Sehar empire and the blessing of her majesty Emperor Belice be with you!”</p>
<p>Belice, who wore a red-wine coloured dress that highlighted her wise red-coloured eyes and a golden belt with elaborate woodwork symbolising the world tree, that accentuated her narrow waist, smiled in benevolence.</p>
<p>“Everyone, lift your heads. Thank you for coming to the commemoration party of the Belecian palace. Words cannot express how happy I am. For today, let us forget about formalities and enjoy ourselves. Now let the evening begin.”</p>
<p>As Belice finished her speech with a smile, the sound of applause and the orchestra announced the beginning of the evening.</p>
<p>Duke Skad’s eyes wandered around the room as if searching for someone, he asked Gen without looking at him.</p>
<p>“Where is that young lady you mentioned?</p>
