            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 46 – Nocturnal Escapades | 19</strong></p>
<p>“Not yet,” Alexcent said in a firm voice.</p>
<p>Amethyst looked at him with dissatisfaction. Under the moonlight peeking through the window, Alexcent’s platinum hair glistened, his red eyes shone brightly, heat steamed off from his back while his lips twitched into a smile.</p>
<p><em>Really he was just too sexy.</em></p>
<p>Then slowly, very slowly he placed his lips on her stomach making her flinch. Before she realized what he was up to, he buried his head between her parted legs.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Alec!”</p>
<p>Her back arched, head tilted backward. His teeth teasingly nibbled on her sensitive spot.</p>
<p>His tongue licked at her as though he was quenching his thirst, all the while finger!ng her.</p>
<p>She felt a mixed sensation of pain and pleasure stemming from her core. Laced under the intense rapture was an unknown urge to let go. No, it was more like wanting to let herself free.</p>
<p>“Alec… I… can’t hold back any more—” She whispered.</p>
<p>“Hold it.” The raspy voice commanded.</p>
<p>Amethyst shook her head in negation.</p>
<p><em>I don’t want to hold back …</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t want to hold back.</em></p>
<p><em>No, I do. I want to feel him more… But I just can’t hold back anymore!</em></p>
<p>Engulfed by a dilemma, unable to choose between the immense pleasure surging and the pain deep within, unable to decide on as to what to do with it all… she crumbled, surrendering, allowing it to consume her. Now, awash with intense emotions, a river of tears burst forth her dewy eyes and streamed down her flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>“Sniff … sniff.”</p>
<p>Feeling the delicate body under him quiver, Alexcent came to an abrupt pause. He straightened himself and wrapped the bundle of despair in his arms.</p>
<p>“If it’s difficult to hold back then you don’t have to,” he whispered softly by her ears.</p>
<p>“I don’t know—”</p>
<p>Amethyst threw a fit saying she didn’t understand what he meant by not to hold back. Seeing her huff and puff, tickled him silly, he broke into a hearty laugh.</p>
<p><em>‘When she’s sobbing like this she really is too cute. I wonder if she is really naïve or bold.</em></p>
<p>Alexcent kissed the corner of her eyes and asked playfully. “Don’t understand what?”</p>
<p><em>What does he mean…what? </em>Emelis looked up at him and shook her head. She felt embarrassed to say it out loud.</p>
<p>Alexcent then placed a hand on her lower abdomen and stroked it as he asked. “How did it feel?”</p>
<p>His hand seemed to be asking her how it felt inside. Amethyst’s face turned bright red but her lips remained shut.</p>
<p>“Okay. Then don’t hold back and you can go ahead first,” he said mirthfully.</p>
<p>“It’s embarrassing!” Amethyst blushed brighter at his words and hit his shoulder in jest.</p>
<p>“This time I won’t stop.” He declared.</p>
<p>“Hmm?!”</p>
<p>In response, Alexcent plunged himself inside her while holding her in his arms.</p>
<p>She let out a short cry and breathed loudly as she rode him while sitting on his knees.</p>
<p>The entire room echoed with the sound of flesh slapping flesh as love nectar seeped and added to it all. The silent night was drowned in her lustful moans and his rough breaths.</p>
<p><em>Ahh … This feeling … This fullness …</em></p>
<p>In this moment, Amethyst was unable to differentiate anything, and as always clung onto him as she reached her limits.</p>
<p>※</p>
<p>As a result of the intense nocturnal escapades, Amethyst woke up later than usual.</p>
<p><em>‘Today I shall take the walk I missed out on yesterday.’ </em>She resolutely thought to herself as she lifted her aching body with all her might. She then let the maids know she was up.</p>
<p><em>Wow I must really have gotten used to being cared for…. They say humans are animals of adaptability. I guess it really is true. Ah, what a different side of me …</em></p>
<p>After filling her tummy with the simple breakfast the mains brought, she changed into  a dress. As always, it was a comfortable loose dress. Quickly she went towards the garden of the mansion. Even though it was late in the morning, the air was still refreshing.</p>
<p><em>Ha, this is nice! Nothing to do, nothing to think about … Just eating, sleeping, eating, sleeping this is true healing! And of course, the steamy nights with him!</em></p>
<p>The fellow was perfect like the main character out of a fairy tale<em>. Well, except for his sharp tongue. </em>From a certain point somewhere, she had stopped thinking of her past as Heeyeon. She wasn’t too sure why but every time she did her head seemed to throb. So eventually, she stopped thinking about it, and now acted naturally like Amethyst.</p>
<p>And that was how she was behaving as she started her peaceful and comfortable morning when she was brought to a halt by a scream from nearby.</p>
<p>“Kyaa! Please stop!”</p>
<p><em>What is this? It’s a woman shouting! </em>Amethyst headed towards the scream.</p>
<p>A few knights were surrounding a maid and laughing.</p>
<p>“Please—”</p>
<p>“What do you mean please! We just want to play for a while so stop being so rigid.”</p>
<p>“Please no …. don’t do this.” The maid earnestly pleaded</p>
<p>“What do you mean no? We know you all want to seduce a knight and live a better life, so don’t put up a front!”</p>
<p>“I….never!”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha! This one’s pretty cute acting naive and all!” One of the knights touched the maids ass and played around.</p>
<p>The frightened maid tried to run away but the knights blocked and cornered her. From the looks of it, it really felt like something was about to happen. The maid screamed in fear and despair as she felt panicked.</p>
<p><em>Ha, what should I do. I made it clear that I won’t interfere with the things that happen in the mansion.</em></p>
<p>A year from now she would no longer be the wife of the duke, so she had been trying hard to ignore all that was happening within the mansion so she could keep her side of the contract. She believed she should live as quietly as possible and disappear as quietly as possible. And in order to do so, she had to live like a ghost. This was why she spent her time isolated in the mansion and declined all sorts of social invitations. It was a decision she had made for her near future.</p>
<p>What’s more, she had even pretended to not care when Pon and Lunia informed her of her duties as the duke’s wife, and had pushed them away. But this time it was something she simply couldn’t ignore…</p>
