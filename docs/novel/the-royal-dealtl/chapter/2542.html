            <p><strong>Chapter 126</strong></p>
<p>After the duke’s remark, everyone fell silent, except for Baron Piamon who dared to say,</p>
<p>“Never mind, My Lady,” he spoke in wry smile, “Maybe you shouldn’t.” He hiccupped as he had swallowed too fast, startled by Alexcent.</p>
<p>“No,” said Amethyst, “Thank you so much for offering. I can’t be so rude as to refuse.”</p>
<p>“But,” said Baron Piamon hurriedly. He still remembered that night. He didn’t want to risk Alexcent’s wrath. “But what if it… like before…”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s alright,” assured Amethyst, “This time I know what to expect so I wouldn’t gulp it down like last time.” She looked at Pon. “Pon, can you pass me the smallest glass?”</p>
<p>Amethyst received the glass from Pon and held it out to Baron Piamon. “Would you be so kind to pour me some?” she asked, sweetly. A vein throbbed in Alexcent’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Baron Piamon, pouring her a glass, “But you really must drink only very little.” Baron Piamon was too preoccupied to glance towards the duke but count Renove and count Houres looked at Amethyst and the Duke, curiously.</p>
<p>Amethyst brought the glass up to her lips. She spared a fleeting glance at Alexcent, his jaws were clenched. To provoke him further, she looked at her glass and took a sip, relishing the sweet taste on her tongue. She took little sips. Alexcent was still in the same posture, his reaction unchanged.</p>
<p><em>Maybe this isn’t enough, </em>thought Amethyst. <em>That’s alright. You asked for it, Alec! </em>She placed her glass down on the table.</p>
<p>“As expected, it’s so sweet I could die drinking it,” she said, “It’s the kind of alcohol that everybody loves.”</p>
<p>Baron Piamon, who had been anxious that she would gulp it all down like last time, visibly relaxed as she put her glass down.</p>
<p>“Is that so?” he said, “I am glad you like it.”</p>
<p>“Once it’s officially released, would you let me know?” she asked. “I would like to buy some.”</p>
<p>“Of course!” said baron Piamon, “You will be the first to know.”</p>
<p>“It would make a great present for acquaintances,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“You really think so?” said baron Piamon, “I couldn’t ask for more!”</p>
<p>“Of course!” said Amethyst, “It’s such fine quality. I am sure it will be much loved by everybody.”</p>
<p>“Yes! You really are amazing, Lady Skad,” said Baron Piamon, “You have a good eye for tastes. If the word goes out that even you recommend it, the sales will peak!”</p>
<p>“Oh, you flatter me,” said Amethyst, “I am sure it will get good reviews from everybody.”</p>
<p>Amethyst continued to praise Baron Piamon’s alcohol, while Count Renove and Count Houres prayed for the baron’s wellbeing as they looked at silent and cold Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency,” said Count Glacia, “Your glass is empty. Let me pour you a drink.”</p>
<p><em>Has she finally snapped? </em>Count Glacia wondered. <em>To think she continues flirting with Baron Piamon. Maybe she is desperate after that visit in the afternoon. How pitiful! I had no idea she would fall apart so easily. I didn’t even have to do much work.</em></p>
<p>Count Glacia poured the drink for Alexcent. She was happy that there was nothing in her way anymore since Amethyst seemed to have turned to Baron Piamon. Meanwhile, Amethyst blood boiled when she saw Count Glacia trying to cozy up to Alexcent.</p>
<p>She stilled herself. <em>I have to be rational, </em>she said to herself, <em>I cannot be swayed by Count Glacia’s antics. I have got to hold it together. </em>She gathered herself but it was just as well that her face turned reddish. She was already feeling the effect of alcohol even after a small sip. She decided to use that to her advantage.</p>
<p>“Oh my!” said Amethyst,” I feel rather warm….” She fanned her face. She brushed her hair back. She swept her hair and pretended like she couldn’t bear the hair falling on her back. She leaned back and shook her hair. She combed through them gently with her fingers. She gathered them at the top of her head and tied them into a bun. He made it seem very casual because that was part of the trick. Her shawl had slipped from her shoulders as she did her hair. It had slid down to her arms exposing her neck and bare shoulders.</p>
<p>“Ah, it feels cooler now,” she said, fanning herself again.</p>
<p>She smiled and turned to Baron Piamon again, pretending to be very attentive to whatever he was saying. She occasionally indulged a chuckle at his jokes. She glanced at Alexcent every now and then, meeting his gaze and directing him a small smile.</p>
<p><em>This should do, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>but why does he still seem so indifferent? Does he really not care anymore? </em>Every time she glanced at him, he still looked impassive. He looked rather arrogant, leaning on the sofa and drinking down the alcohol that Count Glacia had filled for him. The only movement was him tipping the glass to his lips.</p>
<p>Count Renove and Count Houres looked on cautiously and hoped the duke wouldn’t smash the glass at them. There were now two veins throbbing at Alexcent’s forehead. Amethyst was starting to worry. <em>Does my charm not work on him at all? Or does he simply not care?</em></p>
<p>Count Glacia, however, was smug. Seeing his wife openly flirting with another man didn’t do anything to stir Alexcent. He barely seemed to react. It made her feel hopeful. To aggravate Amethyst, count Glacia sat so close to Alexcent and stroked his thigh, making it seem accidental.</p>
<p>Amethyst felt her anger flare and sparks ignited in her eyes, momentarily. But she bit her lips and restrained herself. <em>I really wasn’t going to take it all the way, </em>thought Amethyst, <em>but if this is how it’s going to be, I am going to go all out. I am Sharon Stone.</em></p>
<p>There was a reason as to why Amethyst had chosen this particular dress. The sides of the dress were split so when she moved, it showed her thigh. She pretended to listen to Baron Piamon when a groan escaped her lips.</p>
<p>“Oh, I am so sorry,” said Amethyst, “I think the drink is getting to me.” She chuckled.</p>
<p>She felt Alexcent’s gaze on her. Her whole body was aware he was looking at her, but she still didn’t turn to look at him. It was as though his gaze bore into her. She lifted her left leg and crossed it over her right. The femme fatale pose. The hem of the dress ran down her thighs, exposing them partly.</p>
<p>She was wearing high, black heels which dazzled in the light. She had deliberately chosen the heel to go with the dress because it accentuated her height. She let one of her heels hang loosely from her toes. The black heel emphasized her pale skin. Her face was slightly red, her eyes looked unfocused and her lips were red. A few strands of her hair hung around her face. Her neckline and collarbone were exposed. Her shawl wrapped delicately around her lower arms. The dress hugged her body tight and glistened in the light. She knew she looked attractive, but she wondered whether this was working on Alexcent.</p>
<p>All her attention was focused on him even if she wasn’t directly looking at him. But it seemed he hadn’t changed at all. It didn’t seem like he intended to move his posture anytime soon. Amethyst felt doubt gnaw at her mind. She felt disappointed and anxious. <em>I am such a fool. Why did I dress myself up so much when he doesn’t even care? What should I do? Is he really not interested in me anymore?</em></p>
<p>Her eyes lost focus and she quivered slightly. <em>This is so stupid. Maybe I should just go back…. </em>Her mind was blank. She felt miserable. But she felt a strong hand on her wrist.</p>
<p>“Excuse us,” said Alexcent, pulling her up. “Come with me.”</p>
<p>With those words, he left the office abruptly, pulling Amethyst roughly along with him.</p>
