            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 71</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent took Amethyst, still in his arms, to their bedroom and laid her down on the bed tenderly. He wiped her tears and held her tightly. He then placed a gentle kiss on her lips. Amethyst, who had been too exhausted before, now kissed him with passion. As the kiss became deeper, Alexcent stripped off her dress only to be greeted with another obstruction on his way to her soft skin.</p>
<p>“What is this?” he asked, surprised.</p>
<p>“Well, as you can see,” said Amethyst, “It’s a corset.”</p>
<p>“I know,” he said, “But why?” She never wore a corset because she didn’t like them.</p>
<p>“I thought it would make me appear more demure for today,” she said, smiling.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden, you are trying to be ‘demure’” he said, smirking.</p>
<p>“Oh, shut up,” she said, embarrassed, “You suddenly took me to the bedroom, I didn’t even get a time to change, did I?”</p>
<p>“Turn around,” he said. She hesitated. Alexcent, in his impatience, leaned over her, extended his arms and untied the corset which fell down, revealing her chest.</p>
<p>Amethyst blushed and tried to cover her chest with her hands before looking up at him. His red eyes looked at her, full of desire. She felt her heart racing. Her embarrassment was forgotten, as it was replaced by the same desire he felt.</p>
<p>She felt his eyes all over her. The feeling of danger that she had felt ever since she was almost assaulted, turned into lu$t when she looked at him. She pulled him to her and placed her lips against his. His tongue caressed her own and invaded the sides of her mouth. He placed tender kisses all over her body.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” she mumbled. She felt moans threatening to escape her throat as he became aggressive with his kisses.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to hold back,” he whispered in her ears.</p>
<p>“But it’s embarrassing if anybody hears us,” she responded with difficulty.</p>
<p>“No one can hear us,” he said, kissing her in her most intimate parts, which sent a shiver of pleasure through her body. He gently bit her inner thigh.</p>
<p>“What about the knight you posted outside to guard me?” she asked, biting her lips.</p>
<p>He laughed. “Oh, Ash,” he said, “I don’t know what to do with you sometimes.” He pulled her down gently, so he was on top of her. He looked down at her face, eyes full of passion. “When I am with you, they aren’t guarding you anymore.”</p>
<p>“What?” she asked, confused.</p>
<p>“Well, I am strong enough to protect you,” he smirked. She wanted to wipe the smirk off his face. “But if you want, I can order them to stand guard outside, your m0ans are just too beautiful for my ears only,” he said jokingly.</p>
<p>Amethyst blushed to the roots of her hair. She bit the tip of his nose. “Ow, Ash!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>“That’s what you get for teasing me,” said Amethyst, pouting.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t teasing. If you want, I—”</p>
<p>“Alec!” she cut him off. She glared at him for a moment before she placed her lips on his. Their kiss grew frantic and soon Amethyst was crouching on her hands and knees, as Alexcent thrust from behind. She had nothing else to focus on, except the primal pleasure that she felt from the act and gave in to it.</p>
<p>She felt the ripples of pleasure rising from where he entered her. He must have screamed in pleasure as she came. Her knees were tired, they felt sore. She heard him grunt in ecstasy. He seemed especially involved today.</p>
<p>“Alec, I can’t anymore,” she said, gasping.</p>
<p>“We are far from done, sweetheart,” he said in between irregular breaths.</p>
<p>“No, Alec,” she said, “Stop.” He stopped his thrust and wrapped his arms around her as her knees gave way. Warm fluid flowed from between her legs. Normally, he would carry her to the bathroom and draw her a bath. But today, he let her lie down. He picked up some clothes from the floor and wiped her with it. He laid her down and buried his head in her neck.</p>
<p>Amethyst was far from peaceful, her thoughts raged in her mind. She wondered if she had never seen that maid, would she ever have so recklessly done what she did? But she had no regrets. She needed to find someone new and capable to take up Dajal’s place who would sincerely fulfill their duties and see to the neglected facilities. After all, she was the one that had dug up the mess. She would fix it.</p>
<p>She determined to never let her inaction cause suffering for others. She wouldn’t let history repeat itself. She had only known how to photocopy machines and sort out documents. She would have to learn a lot to fit the position of a manager. <em>One step at a time, </em>she thought.</p>
<p>“Alec,” she called.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” he said.</p>
<p>“What can I even do in this place?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Ash, you are my wife,” he said softly, “This is our mansion. There is nothing you can’t do here. Hush now and go to sleep.”</p>
<p>“Goodnight, Alec,” she said as she felt her eyes droop from exhaustion. She fell asleep in Alec’s arms. But her sleep wasn’t serene, many thoughts raged in her mind.</p>
