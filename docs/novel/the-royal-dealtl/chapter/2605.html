            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 68</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent sighed. “Fine,” he said finally, “Do as you please.”<em> I can’t believe I am relieved at saving this scum, </em>thought Amethyst disgustedly.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Madam,” said Dajal, whimpering at her feet. His head bowed to the floor. “Thank you for saving my life.”</p>
<p>“Don’t make me regret my decision,” she said, anger flaring.</p>
<p>“Never, madam,” said Dajal, “Thank you. I am eternally at your service.”</p>
<p>“Just because I saved you from death doesn’t mean I have forgiven you,” said Amethyst distastefully, “You will receive a fair share of your punishment, I promise you that! In a certain country, the punishment for slush funds, bribery, and money laundering is to be boiled in a cauldron full of water.” She made her way to Dajal. “I have never seen that punishment executed before.”</p>
<p>Amethyst, grabbed him by his collar, and her hand swung towards his right cheek. “This is for all the maids you have assaulted, including me.”</p>
<p>The slap sent him reeling to the floor. The sound rang through the office. Riereia, who stood a little to the side, scratched his own cheek as though he could feel the pain and whistled a low tune. Dajal cradled his right cheek and glared at Amethyst with arrogant eyes.</p>
<p>“This is for Roman, who has tolerated you all this while,” she retorted, as she grabbed him by the neck and swung her hands again, to land on his left cheek. He dropped to the floor, blood flying in spittle.</p>
<p>Dajal, now covered both his cheeks in pain, a rivulet of blood escaping his lips. He looked at her so venomously, as though he wanted to pounce on her and beat her to death. Amethyst pulled all her might and kicked him between his legs.</p>
<p>Dajal screamed in pain. “Don’t you dare show me those eyes,” she yelled. “This is for what you tried to do to me, and what you have done to the maids all this while. You will, hereby, live like you are dead. You will not be permitted to speak to, or see anyone. You will rot in the dungeon for the rest of your life, repenting for your crimes.” Amethyst looked at the knights. They obeyed. Buerre grabbed him by the hair and dragged him out of the office, and Riereia followed behind.</p>
<p>“Everyone out,” commanded Alexcent. Pon and Gen left in silence. It was only Alexcent and Amethyst now.</p>
<p>He was staring at her. She was unable to decide whether he was angry, amused, or annoyed. He finally spoke after a heartbeat, “I will need some time to think… of your punishment.”</p>
<p>“What?” asked Amethyst disbelievingly.</p>
<p>“Did you think I would let slide what happened today without consequence?” he asked.</p>
<p>Emile felt her anger flare. She had one or two things she needed clarified as well. She needed answers on why he let Dajal free, even when he knew everything. Didn’t that make him as guilty?</p>
<p>“Fine,” she spat, “I will take my time as well to think about your punishment.”</p>
<p>“What?” asked Alexcent in a low voice. “What are you even talking about?”</p>
<p>“As if you don’t know!” Amethyst threw her hands in the air. “The man I trusted. It was my folly to ever think you would amount to anything. I am so very mad at you I can’t even look at you right now. I am going to go and change.” She turned around and walked to the door.</p>
<p>Amethyst quickly left the office. Thankfully, he did not attempt to stop her. After the taxing events of the day, she felt utterly exhausted that her legs started shaking. She was trembling. She steeled herself. She still would have to face and confront Alexcent later. His fury, his aggression, never seemed to end. He was never violent verbally or physically with her, but the sight of an angry man still scared her.</p>
<p>Amethyst walked to her room and sat on her bed. She then headed to the bath when her legs and hand stopped shaking a little. She took off the maid uniform that she was still in. She wanted to get rid of these clothes that Dajal had touched. She wanted to scrub her skin raw, to forget his disgusting hands on her.</p>
<p>The awful memory still caused goosebumps to rise on her skin. <em>If he had arrived just a bit late…. </em>She shuddered, unwilling to think about it. Tears stung her eyes, and she wrapped her arms around herself for comfort. She rocked back and forth in the bath, trying to calm herself. <em>It’s okay now. Everything is fine now, </em>she reminded herself, failing to believe it. Her nerves were frayed, and she felt on edge. She couldn’t shake off the feeling of his cold, sharp, evil eyes. She turned the knob and warm water flowed in the bath.</p>
<p>Dajal knew things about her he shouldn’t have known. He had never come near the mansion, so it could only mean that there was a spy here. Maybe one of the maids acted as his source of information. <em>I need to be more careful.</em></p>
<p>He also seemed to be aware of the incident where Amethyst had reprimanded a knight from harassing a maid. Excluding the part of the mansion under Pon’s care, Dajal seemed to have eyes and ears everywhere. In addition to all this, there was the matter of Aran Bank belonging to Alexcent. She felt betrayed and lied to. All the questions and thoughts and emotions raging in her mind made her feel nauseous.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the bathroom door. “Yes?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Ma’am,” the maid said, from outside the bathroom door, “His Highness wishes to dine in the dining room tonight.”</p>
<p>Usually, she ate her food in her room. He had never commented or disapproved of it. The fact that he was informing her to have dinner in the dining room probably meant he was still angry and had no intention to come into their room tonight. She wasn’t going to let it go. She was going to dress up and go have dinner with him in the dining room and have a calm conversation like rational adults.</p>
<p>“Alright,” she said to the maid, “Will you please lend me a hand? I am going to change and dine with him tonight.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” said the maid. Amethyst got out of the bath and wore a robe. She went to her room where the maids had been waiting. They had laid out a simple, high-waisted dress that she preferred.</p>
<p>“No, bring out the corset as well,” she instructed. “As for the dress, I want something a little fancier tonight. The pale yellow one that I bought recently will do.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” replied the maid, as she brought out the dress Amethyst had indicated</p>
