            <p><strong>Chapter 123 – Teach a Lesson (1)</strong></p>
<p>Here she was thinking of helping Alec and Count Glacia, while Count Glacia was bent on disrupting her life. Never! She will change the whole story if she has to. She resolved to stand by Alexcent’s side and not give up. She simply needed to fight back and not budge from her position.</p>
<p><em>I won’t give him up, </em>she thought.</p>
<p>She resolved to teach Count Glacia a lesson on her greed. She will show her what happens when a person doesn’t know their boundaries and infringes on other people’s life.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Roman!” she called.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Is Lunia not back yet?”</p>
<p>“Not yet, Madam,” said Roman.</p>
<p>“It seems like the shopping is taking longer than expected.” Somehow, Amethyst could imagine Lunia’s sunken and tired face in her mind. Amethyst, who had finished her simple dinner, was seated in front of her vanity.</p>
<p>“Roman, could you help me with my makeup?”</p>
<p>“Are you planning to go out?” Roman was surprised by Amethyst’s request. It was fairly late in the night.</p>
<p>“Not really,” she said, “Ah, could you call Pon?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Madam.”</p>
<p>A moment later Pon arrived. “You called, Madam?”</p>
<p>“Is Alec still in the conference room?”</p>
<p>“No. They’ve adjourned the meeting, and he is in consultation with the heads in his office.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? How long will they take?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it will end soon.”</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded. That was good. She had time. If he is in his office, it would be easier.</p>
<p>“Pon. I have a favor to ask.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Madam,” said Pon, “Anything.”</p>
<p>“Could you help me prepare some tea and snacks, as well as some alcohol?”</p>
<p>“Alcohol as well?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I have a use for it. Glasses as well.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Understood.” Pon left the room to prepare the things as requested.</p>
<p>“Roman, can you make it a simple kind of make up?” asked Amethyst, “The one where you seem like you are not wearing any. The ‘natural’ look.”</p>
<p>“Understood, Madam,” said Roman.</p>
<p>Roman called another maid to help her with it. They did the best they could.</p>
<p>“Could you tie half of it and let the lower half just flow down?” said Amethyst to the maid assisting with her hair.</p>
<p>“Understood,” said the maid.</p>
<p>“As for the dress,” said Amethyst, “The coral one I bought a long time ago from Newhenfield will do.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>So, as instructed, the maids tied half her hair up while letting her long, lush hair flow naturally. Her lips were glossy. The whole make-up made her look demure and soft and elegant. Her coral dress hugged her at the shoulders, exposing her collar. The lower half enveloped her body in a mermaid-cut. She felt nervous, like an actress getting ready for a red-carpet entrance.</p>
<p>She was satisfied with the look when the maids were done with her. But somehow it seemed as though something was still lacking. “Can you bring out my shawl?” she asked the maid, “Preferably something lacy and slightly see-through.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said Roman. Shortly, she appeared at Amethyst’s side with a lacy, sheer shawl and draped it around her shoulders. Finally, everything fit into place. It was perfect as can be.</p>
<p>“Thank you to you all for your help,” she said to the maids.</p>
<p>Pon knocked at the door and announced that all the preparations were done.</p>
<p>“One moment!” called Amethyst and she walked to the dressing room rummaging through her things. She found what she was looking for and emerged wearing it on her wrist. <em>All the best, </em>she said to herself. She smiled to the maids. Roman beamed a smile back at her. She left the room confidently.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Pon,” she called.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>
<p>“Is Alec still in his office?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>
<p>“Is everyone else still with him?” she asked.</p>
<p>Pon, who was pushing a trolley full of snacks, tea and alcohol, walked the corridor with her. “count Citri, Count Onslow, Baron Zephyr have returned to their quarters,” he said.</p>
<p>That meant that the remaining people were count Glacia, Count Renove, Count Houres and Baron Piamon. Count Glacia seemed like this pesky little fly that was always present everywhere. She felt annoyed, recalling the incident of the day.</p>
<p>Since Count Onslow is the most senior among the nobles, he must have retired early. While Count Citri and Count Zephy, being newlyweds, would want to go back and spend time with their wives. The countesses might not be back from their shopping yet. Perhaps they are waiting for them.</p>
<p>“Madam?” called Pon bringing her back to the present. They had arrived at the door of the office.</p>
<p>“Wait a second, Pon,” she said. She took a deep breath and prepared herself. She nodded to Pon to indicated that she was ready.</p>
<p>Pon knocked at the office door. “Come in,” said the low voice of Alexcent which made her heart flutter.</p>
<p>Pon glanced at her and she nodded. He opened the door for her, and she walked in. “I hope I am not disturbing,” she said. Pon pushed in the trolley with tea and snacks.</p>
<p>Alexcent, who was seated in his chair, leaning back, straightened at the sound of her voice. He looked at her standing there slightly stiff.</p>
<p>“Of course not, Lady Skad!” said baron Piamon, welcoming her, “What brings you here at this hour?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I heard that you were still having a discussion in the office,” said Amethyst, “It is late, and I felt like I have been neglecting my duties as a hostess. So, I brought some tea and snacks.”</p>
<p>Pon was laying the said tea, snacks and alcohol upon the table in the center as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Goodness! Thank you Lady Skad,” said Baron Piamon, “What would we ever do without you?”</p>
