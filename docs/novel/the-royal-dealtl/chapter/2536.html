            <p><strong>Chapter 132</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst needed them out of her sight. She didn’t trust anyone except Roman and Lunia. She needed the spy somewhere far away from her so they wouldn’t parrot her plans to Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“Madam, I don’t think anyone can procure a good dress from the boutiques in such a short time,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“I know,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Then why did you send them?” asked Lunia, surprised.</p>
<p>Amethyst smiled. “Because we need to seize the crisis by its throat and turn it into an opportunity.”</p>
<p>She opened the door of her bedroom and walked to Alexcent’s room. She closed the door behind her. It was the first time she had entered his bedroom. He always came to hers so there wasn’t a need for her to come here. His room was neat and tidy. Not like hers with stuff strewn all over the place. He always teased her that her room was more like a pigsty.</p>
<p>This bedroom was like its owner: arrogant, cold, thorough… and overwhelming. She reminded herself that time was short, and she had no time to look around.</p>
<p>She walked straight to his dressing room followed by Lunia and Roman, who were very confused. Amethyst chose a white shirt without extravagant detail and the notched lapel vest that Alexcent always wore with his uniform. She headed to the display cabinet where Alexcent’s accessories were laid out. She chose the golden badge with the Skad emblem, the one he always wore when he went to the palace.</p>
<p>“Lunia, Roman,” she called.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,’ they intoned.</p>
<p>“Lunia, please go and inform Gen that I will be a little bit late. Tell him to inform Alec that he can head to the ballroom first,” she said, “make sure he does this no matter what.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” said Lunia, glanced at Roman and left the room.</p>
<p>“Roman,” called Amethyst, “Please find a maid with the quickest hand at sewing. Preferably someone who can get things done in a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” said Roman and left in a hurry.</p>
<p>Amethyst went back to her room and waited for them. Shortly, Lunia returned. Roman came back with two maids on her tow.</p>
<p>“Will you be able to alter this vest so that it can fit me?” asked Amethyst to the maids.</p>
<p>“Just reducing the fit around the waist could work for the vest,” said one of the maids.</p>
<p>“That will do for now,” said Amethyst, “Reduce the length of this shirt and the sleeves to fit me as well.”</p>
<p>“Yes, madam,” said the maids, “Understood.”</p>
<p>“How long will it take?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t take too long madam,” said one of the maids, “A couple of minutes.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” said Amethyst, “Then I leave these clothes in your care.”</p>
<p>After the maids got to their work, Amethyst went to her dressing room and chose a tight-fitting pants and boots. “Roman,” she called.</p>
<p>“Yes, madam?” said Roman.</p>
<p>“Could you help me with my hair?” said Amethyst, “Tie it up and leave no loose strands. Up high in a ponytail.”</p>
<p>“Of course, madam,” said Roman and got to work.</p>
<p>“Lunia?” called Amethyst, “Could you help me with the make-up? I want the lips to be red.”</p>
<p>“Of course, madam,” said Lunia, as she powdered Amethyst’s face and worked with rouge and lipstick.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the maids presented her with the finished clothes tailored as per her request.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your hard work,” said Amethyst, “I apologize for the rush.”</p>
<p>“Not at all, madam,” said the maids, “It’s our honor.”</p>
<p>Amethyst wore the altered shirt and unbuttoned the top three buttons, so that the collar draped a little off her shoulders. It was a large shirt but with the waist and the sleeves tailored to her length, it added an appealing amount of volume to the outfit. She wore the tight vest over the shirt and pinned the gold Skad emblem on her front. She then wore her skinny pants which hugged her body. It was her riding pants but right now, it didn’t matter. It would do the job well. She tucked the front of the shirt into her pants while she left the back flaring out. She then wore her long black boots.</p>
<p><em>Really, I do have killer legs, </em>thought Amethyst, admiring herself in the mirror.</p>
<p>“Madam…,” said Lunia, in awe, “You look like a knight!”</p>
<p>“But will you really be wearing pants to a <em>ball</em>?!” asked Roman, outraged.</p>
<p>“Well, there is no choice,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Will…will you really be alright like that?” asked Lunia.</p>
<p>“I will be fine,” said Amethyst, “I am supposed to be the Lady of the Household. So, it is by my invitation everyone is coming to the ball. I can do as I please.”</p>
<p>“It does suit you,” said Roman, “The outfit.”</p>
<p>“Thank you!”</p>
<p>Lunia presented Amethyst with a black mask. “I had a spare one, just in case,” she said.</p>
<p>“Really Lunia,” said Amethyst, “You always save the day!”</p>
<p>Amethyst looked at the mask in her hands. In movies, masked ball was very common. She had chosen this for her own benefit. She wanted the ball to be a place where everyone could enjoy themselves without being conscious about how they dressed or how pretty they looked. Amethyst didn’t want to spend her time worrying about whether she looked pretty like the other ladies instead of enjoying her time. This way, with everyone practically seeming like strangers, everyone would be comfortable.</p>
<p>If things had gone as planned, she would have worn her beautiful red dress and danced the whole night with him…. <em>Well, too bad, </em>she thought, <em>can’t be helped. </em>She brought the mask up to her face.</p>
<p>“Now, shall we go?” She wore her white gloves and walked to the impending ball.</p>
