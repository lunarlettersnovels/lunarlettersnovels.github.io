            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 88</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gen was at his desk, still working. His work never seemed to end, instead whenever the Duke met his wife, his work increased. He tore at his hair angrily. The manual needed to be finished in order for him to be able to answer any question the Duke would ask.</p>
<p>“Hm…,” said Gen to himself, “I think this will do for now. I am going to go crazy over handling the budget for next year. Pon said Madam was taking care of the budgets and seemed to be quite skilled at it, perhaps I can slip this to her…”</p>
<p>He flipped through the documents, sorting them out, when he heard a loud explosion. <em>Boom boom boom! </em>Gen’s hand at his chin slipped in shock. He got up from his desk and hurried to the window. <em>What the….</em> He donned his coat and rushed out of his office. His agents quickly got into step with him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Gen,” said the agent, “I have multiple messages that needs your urgent attention. This is from Marquis of Gravia.” He said shuffling the papers he had in his hands. “This one is from Duke of Rhoden, this one from Earl of Huam—”</p>
<p>“Just give them to me,” he reached for them and walked in a hurry. He looked at the messages one at a time:</p>
<p>[What does the flame mean? Is it an alarm? – Marquis of Gravia]</p>
<p>[Is this a declaration of war against the nobles? – Earl of Huam]</p>
<p>[Please report ASAP which the family this signal belongs to – Duke of Rhoden]</p>
<p>“Shit!” muttered Gen, “The nobles are going crazy.”</p>
<p>“I will see the Duke and clarify,” he said to his agent, “Wait for me.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said the agent, “But you must hurry. The messages are constantly arriving.”</p>
<p>He gave a curt nod and walked to the door of Amethyst’s bedroom. He knocked twice and pushed the door open for he had no time to dally. Nobody had the authority to open and enter a lady’s room without her explicit permission, but Gen was not there for formalities. This was a situation of great urgency. He saw the Duke’s silhouette at the balcony, so he headed that way.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency!” Gen addressed him with alarm.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Alexcent, looking annoyed at the interruption.</p>
<p>Gen seemed taken aback at his indifference. “It’s chaos,” he said hurriedly, “The nobles are frantic because of that signal. Why did you use your attack magic as though it was an alarm for an imminent war?” Gen noticed, only after a moment, that Amethyst was standing by Alexcent’s side. He faltered.</p>
<p>“Did you just…,” he muttered exasperated. “Which family is it this time?”</p>
<p>“None,” he said, calmly.</p>
<p>“Then is this supposed to be a warning for something or someone?” Gen asked, taking an effort to get to the bottom of this without losing his head.</p>
<p>“No,” he said, curtly.</p>
<p>Gen felt his blood boiling at his short answers. His master acted as though nothing was amiss. “Well, what the hell was that magic for then?” he asked sharply.</p>
<p>“Oh,” Alexcent said, turning to look at Amethyst, smiling, “I wanted to show her.”</p>
<p>Gen was so flabbergasted that he laughed as if his words were so absurd to hear. “Just because she wants to see some flames,” he said through gritted teeth, “You use your attack magic?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>
<p>“Alexcent, are you drunk?” Gen asked with brows furrowed.</p>
<p>“No,” he replied briskly.</p>
<p>“Then, pray tell me, is there something wrong with your head today?” Gen asked mockingly.</p>
<p>“No, I am fine,” he said.</p>
<p><em>No, I am fine, </em>lingered in his ears and echoed to the deep part of his mind and his anger flared. “What in hell is wrong with you?!” exclaimed Gen, “Are you out of your mind? Using your attack magic so lightly! Telegrams are coming from every corner of the kingdom, messages flooding in.” He turned to him. “Tell me, what are you going to tell the nobles? If you don’t prepare a decent response, they are going to take this as a declaration of war! Who is this hellhole will believe you when you say you were putting on a little show for your wife? Tell me honestly, you are doing this to push me to the brink, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“I am not, Gen…,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Then what are you going to tell the nobles?” Gen asked vehemently. “The Duke of Rhoden was asking which family the signal belongs to!”</p>
<p>Amethyst stepped forward. “Why would anyone blame the Duke for ‘putting on a show’ for his wife?” she asked. “Aren’t you overreacting? It was just fireworks.”</p>
<p>“Me? I am overreacting?” retorted Gen, “Here, read these telegrams and tell me again if I am overreacting, my lady.” He pushed the telegrams in Amethyst’s hands. “And please get it in your vain little head that these aren’t just fireworks conjured for a little show for his wife. When the Duke uses Attack magic, it is either a signal for imminent attack, or a declaration of war.”</p>
<p>“But how—”</p>
<p>Gen cut her off. “Because the whole of the Empire made a pact to use such magic only in the face of war!” He snapped.</p>
<p>“What…,” mumbled Amethyst, shuffling through the telegrams.</p>
<p>“You didn’t know?” Gen said viciously, “Of course you didn’t! Try to get out of your little bedroom and learn a thing or two, why don’t you? The Empire is divided into nobles and royals. Skad family is part of royalty. After the Great War, His Excellency’s attack magic was limited to be used in the face of war only. An agreement was made between the nobles and the royals. His Excellency here has violated that agreement today. All the other families of importance will naturally protest and rally their armies if a war is going to take place. This is a very serious situation, and you call it ‘just fireworks’! How ignorant!”</p>
<p>“What I mean is… Can’t you just inform them that it was an act of love. That he did it for his wife,” said Amethyst softly, “That it didn’t mean anything offensive!”</p>
<p>“Love?” retorted Gen, “Who would believe that? Tell me, how does ‘the Duke used his Attack Magic for love’ sound to you? You think that would make a strong enough argument?”</p>
<p>“Well, that is the truth, isn’t it?” Amethyst said.</p>
<p>“The truth?” said Gen, exasperated, “You really think that?”</p>
<p>“I mean Alexcent loves me. I am his wife,” Amethyst turned to Alexcent for support.</p>
<p>“Do you expect me to believe that?” said Gen sharply.</p>
<p>“Why can’t you?” she asked helplessly.</p>
<p>Alexcent scratched his head, thinking hard on what he should say, and if anything he said might be taken as a misunderstanding by both Gen and Amethyst. “Ash, um,” he said, after a long while.</p>
<p>“What?!” Amethyst snapped at him. His silence was getting on her nerves.</p>
<p>“Gen knows,” he said, cautiously.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Amethyst, confused.</p>
<p>“He knows about our contract marriage,” he said.</p>
