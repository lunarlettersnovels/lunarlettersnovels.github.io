            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 19 – Love at First Sight (1)</strong></p>
<p>Belice, that day was like the noble being, she always had been; she was herself. The duke, in stark contrast, had degraded himself to a savage beast, so overcome with bloodlust that he was a stranger to his own sister.</p>
<p>He witnessed her transparent feelings of fear, anguish, heart break and repulsion reflect in her eyes.</p>
<p>He, who had solely led his life for her happiness, constantly sought her approval, felt as though his existence itself was being rejected. The thought shattered his already-fractured soul into a billion tiny fragments.</p>
<p>When she had smile, he had laughed, when she was unhappy it would make him melancholic for days. To the duke in his younger days, she was his everything. He was she and she was he.</p>
<p>That look of utter disgust, received from her had determined that his life, thereafter, would be far more shameful than death itself. He had felt a chill run down his spine. For the first time in his life, he was introduced to fear in its most glorious element.</p>
<p>He did not want his existence to be rejected by anyone ever again. He couldn’t grant them the authority to invalidate every decision he’d made in his life by making him feel ashamed of his own self.</p>
<p>It would be better to live his life alone, in total isolation, than to live in a constant fear of rejection.</p>
<p>It was then that the duke who had turned into a monster, shut the door to his heart.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no need to explain all of this to Amethyst, a complete stranger entering his life for a fleeting period of time who sat opposite him, patiently awaiting his response.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say that it’s to ensure my privacy and freedom and also, my sister’s inner peace.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Speaking of privacy and freedom. From the moment the engagement is engaged and until this marriage is annulled, you can’t have an extramarital affair with another woman.”</p>
<p>“What do you take me for?!” He asked disgruntled.</p>
<p>“Not even an affair with a man.” She answered cheekily.</p>
<p>His eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>“What? Are you…serious right npw? “</p>
<p>She giggled, heartily amused. “Aw, you can be endearing when you want to be.”</p>
<p>Amethyst smiled at him in delight, while he blew his top.</p>
<p><em>‘And here I thought that good looks were the only department he was blessed in.’</em></p>
<p>She may lie to herself, but his good looks had played a large part in her agreeing to the whole sham. She, who loathed even the mention of marriage, had been convinced just because he was so dreamy to look at. It would certainly make the relationship more bearable.</p>
<p>She reasoned with herself.</p>
<p><em>‘Even if a man’s face isn’t everything, it is something when what lies underneath is just the same in every member of the species. Might as well pick one with good looks. Unappealing ones were even more useless.’</em></p>
<p><em>From that aspect, he was the best possible option.</em></p>
<p>Heeyon, who was living the second chapter of her life, an ultra premium upgraded version of her first, at that, had nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>“It’s Alec.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“My name. Call me Alec.”</p>
<p>“Then call me Amethyst as well.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Ash.”</p>
<p>“Ash? My name is Emesis.”</p>
<p>“I know that.”</p>
<p>She sighed. <em>I am not going to argue with him. This stubborn fool won’t listen to me even if I correct him, what’s the point?</em></p>
<p>And thus began the contract marriage with the duke, who called her whatever he pleased.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next morning, The Royal Palace and the entire empire was in an uproar by the news of the matrimony of Duke Skad and Count Lohikin’s daughter.</p>
<p>The scandal caused a storm, yet the two people involved were strangely tranquil.</p>
<p><em>‘It had been the first proposal of his life.’</em></p>
<p>“Karune, check if it is true.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I have checked, and it seems to be true.”</p>
<p>“Really? Within a day? Can this really happen?” Belice couldn’t believe the fact even as she re-read the letter sent from the duke’s estate.</p>
<p>“Why, Belice? Even you fell for Duke Roden at first sight and made such a scene to marry him, right? I hope you haven’t forgotten already?” Alexcent, who came unannounced, stood grinning, leaning against the doorway of the his siter empress’ office.</p>
<p>Belice’s crimson eyes were fixed at the sparkling ones mirroring hers, set in her brother’s face.</p>
<p>“So, you fell for her at first sight? You?”</p>
<p>He answered flippantly, “There’s no reason I can’t.”</p>
<p>“What are you up to?”</p>
<p>“That’s rather upsetting. Why can’t I fall in love at first sight?”</p>
<p>“There’s no reason you can’t. But honestly, it is unexpected. And also, to think that it would be Lady Lohikin.”</p>
<p>“Well, you’ll find out once you meet her. She is rather charming. You’ll like her too.”</p>
<p>Belice sighed deeply, the next moment she spoke, her tone was diplomatic, “If you say so. Alright, Duke Skad. I invite you for tea tomorrow. You and your lady.”</p>
<p>“Why do we have to come?”</p>
<p>“Why not? Are you afraid? If you find me evil, you should do your part as the fiancé and protect her from her future sister-in-law…when I meet her.”</p>
<p>Belice smiled coldly, finally having him exactly where she wanted to.</p>
