            <p><strong>Chapter 182</strong></p>
<p>Barden, who had not drunk like the other knights the night before headed towards the training ground. He found no one there. <em>I thought I saw someone here…</em></p>
<p>He wondered if it was the trick of his eyes. He grabbed his sword. Even though he had graduated at the top of his class, his skills were so worthless. He had been aware that he wasn’t the best, but he didn’t know that the gap between the skills were so large. He had felt so embarrassed when Lunia had single-handedly restrained him without any difficulty. He hadn’t even been able to lift his head.</p>
<p>Even if she was the lead of a group, he should have offered a better fight to begin with. He resolved not to take a single day off and to practice every second to improve himself. He wanted to be best when it came to swordsmanship. He didn’t want to fall behind.</p>
<p>He focused his energy and collected it to be sent to his sword in the form of a blue flame.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Hearing the sound, his focus was broken. He looked around but saw no one. He grabbed his sword again and he heard a sound again. He realized it came from the forest, so he headed that way. He walked towards the direction of the sound, sword at the ready. He saw that the branched of one of the trees shook violently.</p>
<p>He wondered if someone was hurt and needed help. But as he got nearer, he saw what the matter was, and he flushed a deep red. <em>My goodness! </em>He covered his face with his hands and turned around and quickly fled the scene, embarrassed. He chastised himself for not being able to differentiate between cries of help and cries of passion and quickly made his way away from the forest.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Ash.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>“Ash.”</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>As he woke Amethyst, who was lying in his arms, she whined because she didn’t want to get up. These days, she slept more than usual. “Ash,” he called again.</p>
<p>“Mmm… yes?” Amethyst finally opened her swollen eyes.</p>
<p>Alexcent dropped a kiss on her cheek. “Don’t come to the training grounds today,” he whispered.</p>
<p>“Why?” Amethyst asked as her eyes almost closed again.</p>
<p>“Just don’t.”</p>
<p>“There you go again…saying something without a full explanation…”</p>
<p>“Anyways, don’t leave the room today.”</p>
<p>“Even the room?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Alexcent sighed and pinched her cheeks. “Please for once, will you listen to me?”</p>
<p>“Ha…it hurts…” Amethyst opened her both eyes and sat up.</p>
<p>She lifted her hands as though asking for a hug but when Alexcent went in, she pinched his cheeks instead.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>“It hurts, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>Alexcent nodded.</p>
<p>“Well, me too.”</p>
<p>“Pfft, alright, I’m sorry.” Alexcent hugged her gently and stroked her back.</p>
<p>“I won’t go to the training ground today. But staying in the room all day is too stuffy.”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Alexcent found her answer agreeable, kissed her on her forehead and left the room. Alexcent left to start his daily activities. Amethyst, who no longer felt sleepy, tied her hair into a ponytail and got out of bed as well.</p>
<p><em>Since he told me not to go to the training ground, shall I read in the office? Or, go for a walk? Ah, maybe I should practice shooting!</em></p>
<p>Just then, Lunia entered her room, her legs wobbled a little bit as she walked. “Oh, Lunia, long time no see!”</p>
<p>“Haha, madam. My apologies.” Lunia must have had quite the time with her hangover as she looked paler than usual.</p>
<p>“It’s fine! It happens.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you for your understanding.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have much planned for today. I was thinking of going to read then practicing my shooting.”</p>
<p>“Shooting?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Since there will be a hunting competition arranged by the royal household soon, I thought it would be good to get in some practice.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think practice will be of much use, my lady….”</p>
<p>“Lunia…” Amethyst glared at Lunia, well aware of her lacking skills herself.</p>
<p>“Ah, my apologies. Then I will inform them to have the shooting grounds ready.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Amethyst ate the breakfast Roman had prepared and headed to the office.</p>
<p><em>Hmm…. I think I recall seeing a book on shooting around here somewhere. </em>She walked around looking t the titles of the book. <em>Ah, found it! </em>Amethyst grabbed three books:</p>
<p>『Guide For  Point Shooting』</p>
<p>『All About Great Shooting: Explained by the Best  Hunters』</p>
<p>『A Friendly Guide to Hunting』</p>
<p>She piled the books in her hands and left to her bedroom. Then seated at the table, she opened them one by one. Every time she flipped a page, she was amused. So, there are different types of hunting based on your target. <em>For large animals I guess they corner them in a group of two to three. Wow this is a great tip. I best stay away from large animals.</em></p>
<p>She flipped through the books and penned down the ones that she felt were important. She was so engrossed in her book that she was startled when Lunia rushed in shouting frantically.</p>
<p>“My Lady, it’s an emergency.”</p>
