            <p><strong>Chapter 110 – Eyes and Ears</strong></p>
<p>“Why don’t we use the prettiest blooming roses from the garden and on it’s stalk tie a note that states only the time and location as the invite? It will seem very mysterious. We will have someone deliver the invitation individually to the ladies.”</p>
<p>“Oh! That sounds like a great idea. I’m sure the ladies will have fun.”</p>
<p>“Then as for the person who is delivering the invite….let’s pick the most handsome member of the staff. Anyone in mind?”</p>
<p>Lunia chuckled. “Amongst the members of the staff?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m sure you have someone you’ve always considered ‘good looking’.”</p>
<p>Roman and Lunia glanced at each other. “What about Gen?”</p>
<p>Amethyst’ eyes widened in surprise. <em>Gen? </em>She nodded. He is always overshadowed in the company of Alexcent and is always by his side, and always busy. <em>But I guess Gen is pretty popular with the ladies regarding his look. Not too bad. Dark hair, cat-like eyes, sharp nose…</em></p>
<p>“Now that I think about it… it’s a very good idea.”</p>
<p>“But there is a problem, Madam.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Gen might not agree to something like this.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Roman, “He is always so busy, and I don’t think he will agree to laying this part at all.”</p>
<p>“Hm,” mumbled Amethyst, deep in thought. <em>Gen will obviously not agree to it. He is much to uppity for his own good. But I have a way…</em></p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that,” assured Amethyst, “Tell him that I said it is time to return the favor.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He will know what I am getting at.”</p>
<p>“Gen and flowers,” said Lunia, gleefully, “I will not let him hear the end of it, ever.”</p>
<p>“But please doll Gen up. In a rich noble kind of way. Tell him to wear a cape.”</p>
<p>“Yes, understood.”</p>
<p>Lunia left the room with a large grin on her face to carry out the preparation. There wasn’t much time left to prepare for the tea party that was to be held tomorrow.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Tired of the long continuous meetings, the head of the households were taking a break.</p>
<p>Count Onslow, Count Citri and Baron Houres puffed cigars, while Baron Zephyr was lying down on a sofa. The hangover from the day before was still fresh.</p>
<p>Count Glacia, on the other hand, returned to her room to rest, unlike the gentlemen. Her maid appeared before her with a young maid by her side.</p>
<p>“My Lady,” intoned her maid.</p>
<p>“So, is this the child?” asked Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lady.”</p>
<p>Her maid looked at the young maid by her side. “Greetings Count Glacia,” said the timid, young maid.</p>
<p>“So, you serve the Lady Skad?”</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lady,” said the young maid, “Along with two others.”</p>
<p>“What’s your name?” asked Count Glacia gently.</p>
<p>“Habe.”</p>
<p>“What a pretty name!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, My Lady.”</p>
<p>“The reason why I called you here today…is because I have a small favor to ask,” said Count Glacia, “Will you be able to help me?”</p>
<p>“How may I be of service, My Lady?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing very difficult. I want you to be my eyes and ears.”</p>
<p>“I am just a mere maid,” said Habe, “How can I be what you expect of me?”</p>
<p>Count Glacia took Habe’s trembling hands in hers. “You will be of great help to me, child,” said Count Glacia, “I just need information. I want you to report to me.”</p>
<p>“Information… related to lady Skad?” asked Habe.</p>
<p>“You are smart!” said Count Glacia, “I like you. So, can you help me then? Nothing very big. Small tidbits of information.”</p>
<p>Habe hesitated. She had always been jealous of Roman. Roman used to be a mere maid like her but she had earned the favor of Lady Skad and now was the manager of the household. It should have been her! But no matter how she thought about this offer, she felt like it would be disloyal and dishonest to the ones she served.</p>
<p>“Will it pose any harm to the Lady?” asked Habe, terrified.</p>
<p>“You really are loyal. No wonder she has you by her side,” said Count Glacia, “But don’t worry. Nothing of that sort will happen. The only information I seek are minor ones. What is the lady doing now?”</p>
<p>“She is currently discussing preparation of tomorrow’s tea party with Lunia.”</p>
<p>“See? Easy. That’s the kind of information that I want. Just small everyday things. So, will you do it?”</p>
<p>“If it is… just small things, I think I could.”</p>
<p>“Great!” said Count Glacia as she took of her jeweled necklace that she wore and put it on Habe’s neck. “A gift.”</p>
<p>“But I couldn’t possibly….”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Count Glacia, “It rather suits you. This is a gift for being so loyal to Lady Skad. All of us need a loyal friend like you.” She steered Habe to the mirror. “See? Doesn’t it suit you?”</p>
<p>“But this is too much.”</p>
<p>“Bosh,” said Count Glacia, “No more precious than your loyalty.”</p>
<p>“So, where is Lady Skad holding the tea party?”</p>
<p>“The glass house, I heard.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then they will need to decorate the glass house…”</p>
<p>“I heard they will be decorating it with flowers.”</p>
<p>“Only flowers?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lunia will soon be calling a merchant to order the flowers.”<em>.</em></p>
<p>“Habe, will you then do me a small favour?”</p>
<p>“Of course, My Lady.”</p>
<p>“Could you find out what is Lady Skad’s favourite flower for me?”</p>
<p>Habe had a bad feeling about all of it when Count Glacia asked for a ‘favor’.  But she wasn’t in a position to decline anything that came from a powerful person. She was only a maid. Since Count Glacia had so adamantly handed her the necklace even after her protests, she felt terrified. The favor, for now, seemed small enough.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course!</p>
<p>*<br>
“What rubbish are you gibbering?” asked Gen, sharply.</p>
<p>“It’s not rubbish,” said Lunia, wearily, “Your rudeness knows no bounds. Madam wants you to deliver the invitations.”</p>
<p>“Do what now?!” thundered Gen, “And that too carrying flowers in that foolish attire? No way in hell.”</p>
<p>“Madam has requested it. That you, specifically, send out the invites to the ladies. And what do you mean ‘foolish’? It would look good on you. It’s a nice outfit.”</p>
<p>“Are you out of your minuscule mind?” shot Gen.</p>
