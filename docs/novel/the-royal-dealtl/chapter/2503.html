            <p><strong>Chapter 165</strong></p>
<p>“Maybe she’ll be ill then?” Alexcent confidently gave a nonsense reason. Belice and Amethyst could not stop laughing.</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous. He actually believes you’re going to get sick at the hunting contest in three months?” Belice questioned.</p>
<p>“Alec! What kind of stubbornness is this?” Amethyst couldn’t believe what she was hearing.</p>
<p>Alexcent leaned toward Amethyst and whispered in her ear. “Just wait, I’ll make sure you won’t even be able to get up the day before the hunting competition.”</p>
<p><em>How dare he! To say such things in public?</em> Amethyst thought, blushing. Seeing how Belice insisted on her attending, the hunting competition must be quite different from the annual festival. Even if she wasn’t going to participate, she wanted to at least be a spectator.</p>
<p>Amethyst glared at Alexcent. “Your majesty, my husband is only looking out for my safety. I’m sure I won’t be sick, but I can’t go if my husband doesn’t wish it. Perhaps if it is a royal order, I can…”</p>
<p>“Then it’s a royal order!” Belice replied immediately.</p>
<p>“Belice!” Alexcent was shocked.</p>
<p>“I shall personally send Lady Skad an invitation with my royal stamp on it,” Belice said, defiantly.</p>
<p>“Then I guess I’ll be punished for not abiding to her majesty’s command.” Alexcent could be defiant as well.</p>
<p>“What?!” Belice was not expecting him to stand his ground. She laughed. “Then I suppose I should include punishment for rude behaviour as well.”</p>
<p>“What rude behaviour?” Alexcent asked, as he started to get worried.</p>
<p>“Recently, I don’t like how you steal everything away.”</p>
<p>“Steal? What are you talking about?” Now Alexcent was really concerned</p>
<p>“Well…you’ll just have to wait to find out.” The women laughed. Belice and Amethyst took turns, making up imaginary crimes to tease him with. No matter how good Alexcent was as a politician and businessman, his skills were of little help when the two women banded together to ridicule him.</p>
<p>“Please allow it. I don’t have to be a participant. I’ll just watch.” Amethyst grasped his hands and looked at him with eager eyes, to which Alexcent approved reluctantly.</p>
<p>“If you promise not to leave my side…then I will think about it.”</p>
<p>“I will never, never, NEVER leave your side!”</p>
<p>“Lady Skad I think you’d do well as a businesswoman,” Belice smiled. She seemed satisfied with Alex’s change in decision.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After their tea time with Belice, they prepared to return to the mansion. Amethyst was reminded of something. “It’s technically still office hours, right?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Alexcent replied.</p>
<p>“Then do you think father will still be in the palace?”</p>
<p>Alexcent had been suspicious of Count Lohikin due to specific events that had occurred. He had not yet received his report from Gen regarding the incident, so he treads cautiously with Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Why?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not very often that I come to the palace so I thought I should drop in and say hello. He’d be upset if I didn’t see him.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure that would be all right?” Alexcent inquired.</p>
<p><em>What does he mean by that? </em>Amethyst thought. <em> Does Alec already know that the man is not my real father? Of course, he doesn’t. If he did, he would know that I’m not the real Amethyst.</em></p>
<p>“Wha-what do you mean if that’s okay?” Amethyst stumbled over her words.</p>
<p><em>So there really is something about Count Lohikin.</em> Alexcent was now suspicious of Amethyst’s reaction. <em>She has a tendency to stutter when she wants to hide something. I better get Gen to hurry up with that report.</em></p>
<p>“Nothing,” Alexcent replied simply.</p>
<p>Amethyst was beginning to get anxious. There was no way he could suspect her. But he was hiding his expressions and that definitely meant he’s on to something.</p>
<p><em>If he realizes that I’m not Amethyst, what will happen to me? </em>She had begun to panic. <em>Will I be chased out? He might kill me! But he promised to spare my life. I’d better be careful not to get caught by him.</em></p>
<p>“I miss my father.” Amethyst tried to play to his sympathy.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s see him before we go,” Alexcent conceded.</p>
<p>As they walked, with Alexcent leading Amethyst, you could feel the tension between them. The two headed to the administration office where the Ministry of Finance was located. Amethyst’s eyes widened. She had never been to the administration offices before. The buildings were enormous. They were clearly a representation of the glory of the empire.</p>
<p>Inside, they stopped at a door with the name Count Lake Lohikin engraved over his title, the Vice Minister of Finance. Amethyst knocked.</p>
<p>“Yes, come in,” a voice called from the interior.</p>
<p>As they entered, Count Lohikin rose from his seat and greeted them warmly. “Amethyst!”</p>
<p>“Father!” Amethyst quickly ran to his side and embraced him</p>
<p>“What brings you here?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I had an audience with the Empress, so I thought I would drop by to see you before I headed back.”</p>
<p>“I see. Now let me take a look at your face!” Amethyst took a step back and looked into Count Lohikin’s eyes.</p>
<p>“My darling, I nearly forgot what you looked like.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, father, for not visiting you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. As long as you are doing well, that’s all that matters. But do try to contact me from time to time.”</p>
<p>“Of course.” Amethyst embraced her father in a warm hug and pressed her face against his chest. It was a calculative move to show Alexcent that she was close to her father. It would alleviate his suspicions.</p>
<p>“You always were the independent one,” her father said, holding her tight</p>
<p>“I’m your daughter, it comes naturally,” she laughed.</p>
<p>“If you’re not too busy, can you stay for a while before you go.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have work?”</p>
<p>“No matter how busy I am, I can always make time to chat with you,” Count Lohikin smiled.</p>
