            <p><strong>Chapter 112 – Flower Boy (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Hm… I like flowers which looks small and subtle rather than the huge, extravagant ones. Maybe baby’s breath.” A flower that always grows at the edge of other flowers, helping them grow.</p>
<p>“Oh… baby’s breath will be hard to spot among other flowers. But I can mix them up with the baby’s breath. It will give it a nice, toned-down, pastel effect.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, that would be great!”</p>
<p>“If it is okay,” asked Flora, “May I take a look at the glass house? So that I can ascertain the quantity of the flowers needed.”</p>
<p>“Of course!” said Amethyst. “Habe, will you be kind enough to escort Flora to the glass house?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam,” said Habe. “Please follow me,” said Habe to Flora.</p>
<p>Habe led Flora through the hall to the outer grounds, to the glass house. “May I ask when you will be coming with the flowers tomorrow? If the Lady asks, that is.”</p>
<p>“I intend to arrive early in the morning,” said Flora, “It will take quite a while to decorate the glass house.”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Habe, “Thank you. I will let the Lady know.”</p>
<p>Habe watched Flora as she walked around the glass house taking measurements and exploring the corners where the flowers would go. <em>I am sure Count Glacia will be pleased, </em>she thought as she escorted Flora out of the glass house and to her carriage.</p>
<p>*<br>
Flora came the next morning and dedicated her time to decorating the glass house. Once she was done, Amethyst, followed by Lunia and Roman, entered the glass house to take a look. The air in the glasshouse carried a subtle, delicate floral scent. The flowers themselves had been dusted with gold powder so they glistened in the sun. The space looked ethereal.</p>
<p>“Well done, Flora!” squealed Amethyst with delight, “You have certainly outdone yourself!”</p>
<p>Amethyst admired every flower in the glass house. She couldn’t take her eyes off them. “You couldn’t find the baby’s breath?” asked Amethyst, “Not that it matters, of course, because this is simply divine.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that…,” murmured Flora, avoiding her eyes.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I should…,” stammered Flora.</p>
<p>“Nonsense, go on, it’s alright,” urged Amethyst.</p>
<p>“I had it all prepared,” said Flora, “I mixed in baby’s breath as well. But this morning, Count Glacia came by….”</p>
<p>“And?” urged Amethyst. Her smile froze at the mention of Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“She bought every sprig of baby’s breath I had,” said Flora. “I did inform her that I couldn’t sell all of them as I needed them for a special occasion. But she was rather forceful and reprimanded me for being too excessive with the flowers. I am so sorry. I didn’t have a choice.”</p>
<p>This was a tea party she was organizing, Count Glacia had no right to saunter into the venue and temper with her preparation. Amethyst’ anger flared.</p>
<p>“I see,” said Amethyst, smiling to comfort Flora, “It’s alright. Thank you so much for your excellent work. I do so love your flower arrangements. I hope I can call for your services again?”</p>
<p>“It will always be an honor to serve you, my lady,” said Flora and took her leave.</p>
<p>Amethyst tried her best to control her anger. She tried to calm herself. There was a tea party to prepare for, this won’t do. She only just managed to hide her scowl when the door of the glass house swung open.</p>
<p>“Goodness!” exclaimed Countess Citri.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Countess,” greeted Amethyst.</p>
<p>“This is breathtaking!” said the Countess, “I never knew there was a glass house here either.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much for your kind words,” said Amethyst, “You too look breathtakingly beautiful today, I must say.”</p>
<p>“Oh my! Thank you!” said the Countess, beaming, “I put in some effort. The invitation was really something. So mysterious!”</p>
<p>“I am so very glad to hear you like it,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>Amethyst felt a little closer to Countess Citri, maybe it was because of their similar age. She felt much more comforting and friendly towards her.</p>
<p>Shortly Baroness Zephyr and Baroness Hours came arrived. “Oh my, what fun topic are you two ladies talking about?”</p>
<p>“Nothing yet. We were just admiring the flowers,” said Countess Citri.</p>
<p>“Thank you for inviting us to the tea party today,” said the Baroness. “What a beautiful place!”</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming. Please sit down!” said Amethyst leading them to the tables and chairs placed in the middle with heaps of cakes and macaroons.</p>
<p>Countess Renove and Countess Onslow were the last to arrive. They too greeted Amethyst and commended her for the decorations. They finally sat down in the chairs.</p>
<p>“Who came up with the excellent idea for the invite?” asked Countess Onslow.</p>
<p>“It was my idea, Countess Onslow. I hope you liked it,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Oh, Lady Skad,” said Countess Onslow, “I loved it! A mysterious, handsome thief with flowers! How quaint!”</p>
<p><em>Everyone seems to have loved the invites, </em>thought Amethyst happily, <em>I will make sure I inform and thank Gen later.</em></p>
<p>“Tea will be served shortly,” proclaimed Amethyst as she gestured to the maids to bring forth the tea things.</p>
<p>Just then Count Glacia rushed into the glass house. <em>What is she doing here? </em>Amethyst wondered.</p>
<p>“Count Glacia!” addressed Amethyst, “What brings you here? I thought you would be at the meeting.”</p>
<p>“I heard that you were holding a tea party,” said Count Glacia.</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“So, I rushed form the meeting. It was going to end anyway,” said Count Glacia, “Since it’s the first tea party in the mansion I was curious as to how you would be holding it….and, I wanted to see if I could learn for my future reference should I need to hold a similar party in my own mansion. I didn’t know that the party had already started. I apologize for the intrusion.”</p>
<p><em>There is no way any of that is true, </em>thought Amethyst. She knew Count Glacia might be here to get on her nerves to disrupt the party somehow. Maybe she wanted to provoke her like she did in the banquet.</p>
