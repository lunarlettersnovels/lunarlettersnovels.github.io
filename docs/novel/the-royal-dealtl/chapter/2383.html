            <p><strong>Chapter 285</strong></p>
<p>“Hello, Duke Michen,” the young woman smiled as she greeted her half-brother for the first time in many years.</p>
<p>“Loyalterre, you’ve grown so much.” She had been a scrawny child, the last time he saw her, but now she was a woman. “Everyone here knows me as the Duke. But you are my family. I’m a little sad you don’t address me as such.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I don’t know how to address you.”</p>
<p>“You can just call me brother.” Loyalterre blushed. “You don’t have to be embarrassed. You’re a Roden.”</p>
<p>“All right,” Loyalterre said, shyly.</p>
<p>“You’ll get used to life here. For now, stay inside the mansion and see what noble life is all about. Once we have officially recovered your status, you’ll be free to roam wherever you please. Unfortunately, as you were never registered, the process may take some time.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy to change the status from a peasant to a noble. There was a multitude of evidence required to justify the decision. Unless, however, it was ordered directly from the Empress. As the throne still sat empty, he would have to wait for Belice’s coronation to use that option.</p>
<p>“I’m fine with staying in the mansion. I’m just thankful that you’re giving me a room and clothes.”</p>
<p>“If there’s anything you need, you can ask Hennessey.”</p>
<p>Michen’s head of household bowed. “Welcome to the Roden mansion. I’m Hennessey Winter, the head of household for the Roden family. You can address me as Hennessey.”</p>
<p>“Loyalterre, I have some business to attend to, so I’ll leave you in the capable hands of Hennessey. I’ll see you at dinner?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my Lord…. Brother.”</p>
<p>“Good.” Michen smiled softly at his sister’s awkwardness. She would learn quickly; he was sure of it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As Duke Skad entered the palace, the atmosphere became dark with fear. The servants tried their best to avoid him and if one of them happened to catch his eye, they fainted in terror.</p>
<p>“Greetings to the almighty Empress.” Alexcent kneeled and kissed the back of Belice’s hand.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Belice said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, not yet?” Alexcent’s voice almost growled. The people in attendance held their breaths.</p>
<p>“The coronation has not yet proceeded. I’m going to have you prepare it,” Belice stated.</p>
<p>Alexcent stood up and looked around the audience chamber. “I don’t know what kind of disrespect this is. You still haven’t completed your coronation yet?”</p>
<p>Michen stepped forward. “It was Her Highness’ intention, My Lord.”</p>
<p>Alexcent turned to face Belice. “Yes,” she said. “For the safety of the coronation, I wanted to put someone I can trust in charge.”</p>
<p>“If that is your wish, I will prepare the ceremony immediately. And you can be certain that all precautions will be taken.</p>
<p>“Good. Now that has been settled, let us start our meeting.”</p>
<p>The ruling board all took their seats around a circular table. Karune produced a stack of documents that had been brought back with Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, these are the agreements that Duke Skad received from our allies.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness?” Alexcent glared at Karune in regards to how he had addressed Belice. Karune broke out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” Karune barely squeaked out.</p>
<p>Belice silently shook her head in annoyance and looked over the documentation. “These appear to all be favourable towards us. I will look through them in more detail later.”</p>
<p>“Of course. The next item of business is…” Karune looked at Alexcent to make sure it was all right to continue. More beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. “Now that Duke Skad has quelled any uprisings in the country, we need to consider your future as Empress. These are suggestions of possible matches for you as husband.”</p>
<p>“Husband!” Belice looked at the list that was set in front of her.</p>
<p>Alexcent stared at Belice and then at Michen. Michen just sat still in cold silence. Once the coronation was completed, the Empress would have to marry someone of the proper status. What Alexcent thought was going on between these two could no longer continue.</p>
<p>Belice scowled at the list. “I’ll decide the best option for the Empire after the coronation.”</p>
<p>The rest of the meeting was comprised of minor issues that were quickly resolved. Everyone left the meeting room except Alexcent, who held Belice back.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Alexcent asked.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“A husband?’</p>
<p>“That’s just the way it is,” Belice said, not seeming so sure herself.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you and Michen….”</p>
<p>“No. He’s the leader of the nobles. He can’t be a prince consort.”</p>
<p>“Is that a law?”</p>
<p>“Not that I know of,” Belice admitted.</p>
<p>“So? What’s the problem? Even if the law stated differently, you could just change it. You are the Empress and the ruler of Sehar. You make the laws.”</p>
<p>“Alexcent, this has nothing to do with laws. The most important thing is how Michen feels.” Belice’s lips trembled. How Michen felt was more important to her than anything. “Besides, I can’t tell if he likes me.”</p>
<p>“Whether he likes you or not, why does that matter? You can command him to marry you.”</p>
<p>“Alexcent, I’m not you.” Belice could never be like her bother.</p>
