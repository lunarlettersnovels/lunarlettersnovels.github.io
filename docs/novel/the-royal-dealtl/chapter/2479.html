            <p><strong>Chapter 189</strong></p>
<p>Everyone turned from Barden to the source of the voice. Alexcent looked furious. The vein on his forehead throbbed.</p>
<p>“Hic!” Amethyst was equally surprised as everyone else by Alexcent’s sudden appearance. She almost choked on her drink and had fits of hiccups. While everyone went silent and quiet, there was always one person who never could read the room.</p>
<p>As always, it was Buer. “Oh man, it was just about to get fun…. you came too early!”</p>
<p>“What?” thundered Alexcent, with fists clenched.</p>
<p>Hill and Leyrian tried to stop him, but Buer was too tipsy to understand the situation. “Barden was just about to tell us who his one-sided love is.”</p>
<p>Alexcent looked at Amethyst. Amethyst was trying to suppress her hiccups. She didn’t notice him glance at her.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you curious as well, my lord?”</p>
<p>“Buer, enough…you’re drunk.”</p>
<p>“Come one, you said you were curious too!”</p>
<p>Hill quickly tried to step in but it was no use. Everyone hoped someone would put a stop to this before someone got killed. Buer seemed fated to depart this world before his time.</p>
<p>“Ha, you all really….!” As his rage reached its limit, Alexcent gathered his power. Even though he knew well not to use magic for an attack, he didn’t care and strongly felt the urge to wipe out the entire place.</p>
<p>“No, no!” Hill, who was the only one sober, tried to stop him but Alexcent seemed set on wiping out the entire ground.</p>
<p>“Hic!” Amethyst who couldn’t hold it back, hiccupped loudly. Alexcent turned to look at her. It was probably a good thing that Amethyst was dead drunk. Somehow, she found the courage to talk to him. Without hesitation she spread out her arm and walked towards Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Hehe, Alec, Hic!”</p>
<p>“Just how much did you drink!”</p>
<p>Her hazy eyes already told him the answer. “I didn’t drink that much….” She stumbled.</p>
<p>Alexcent let go of his power and supported Amethyst before she tumbled to the ground.</p>
<p>“Hehe, my very handsome husband! Hic!”</p>
<p>“Ash, get a grip!”</p>
<p>“Ah, why? I like how I’m feeling now…you never show me your face anymore. You’re so busy.”</p>
<p>“Stop…” Alexcent saw her drunk and tipsy and acting this way for the first time. He didn’t know how to react.</p>
<p>“No! I want to drink some more!”</p>
<p>“Ash!”</p>
<p>“Are you getting mad at me?” As Amethyst asked in a sad voice, Alexcent started to sweat. He tried to get a grip on himself and replied, “No… I am not.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I think you -hic- are.”</p>
<p>“I told you I am not mad at you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you are….”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not!”</p>
<p>“Then you drink with me too.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Amethyst wrapped her arms around his waist and placed her head on his chest. “Why can’t you?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that…. You had too much to drink. Let’s go in, alright?” <em>Why the hell is she being so adorable?</em></p>
<p>Alexcent looked around. Hill, Leyrian and Marcus were cheering her on inwardly so that the duke wouldn’t pay attention to them. Feeling the encouragement in their gazes, Amethyst smiled.</p>
<p>“Please, drink here. With me. Hic-”</p>
<p>“Ash… you’re drunk.”</p>
<p>“I know… but everyone is curious.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“About Barden’s crush,” she said, “Hic. Aren’t you -hic- curious too?”</p>
<p>“I’m not.” <em>Because I know it, </em>thought Alexcent. His heart ached.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I already know.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“I… just know.”</p>
<p>Amethyst hugged Alexcent even tighter. “Hehe, I know too! Hic.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you do.” Alexcent looked down at her sadly. Seeing her smile so unguardedly made his heart ache even more.</p>
<p>“How unexpected that you knew too, Alec!”</p>
<p><em>I wonder if he truly knows how I feel. I wonder if that’s why he’s been avoiding me.</em></p>
<p>“Alec…”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I like being in your arms….”</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“No…I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be stubborn.” Amethyst continued to cling onto Alec and, turning her head, called out to Barden.</p>
<p>“Barden!” Amethyst called.</p>
<p>“Yes, my lady.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to take your drink for you…but I can’t….”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“So, tell us….”</p>
<p>“Ash, enough. You’re drunk.” Alexcent tried to stop her, but she didn’t listen.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s curious…. or are you going to drink the whole glass?”</p>
<p>“I… can’t.”</p>
<p>“Then tell us. If not Buer will torture you forever. You won’t be able to sleep tonight.”</p>
<p>Barden looked nervous. He knew it was true. But he wondered what he was so afraid of. It wasn’t a wrong thing to confess one’s love and speak the truth. “I…,” began Barden, “I… the person I love is…” Everyone turned to Barden.</p>
<p>“Lady Lohikin,” said Barden, finally.</p>
<p>Alexcent closed his eyes and scowled. <em>I should have killed the bastard earlier.</em></p>
<p>Everyone turned to Amethyst. She laughed in Alexcent’s arms. Everyone had a surprised, almost shocked look, on their faces. Buer seemed to be taken aback to even utter a word.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Why are you looking at me?” asked Amethyst drunkenly.</p>
<p>“So…the person Barden loves is Lady Lohikin? Is it you Madam?” asked Lunia, as though she didn’t know. Lunia was sure that the prince would have misunderstood so she wanted it to be clear once and for all.</p>
<p>“Haha, Lunia…,” said Amethyst, “he said Lady Lohikin! I’m Amethyst Skad.”</p>
<p>“What?” Alexcent quickly looked down into her eyes.</p>
