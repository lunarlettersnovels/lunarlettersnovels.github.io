            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 55</strong></p>
<p>“Sir Dajal, it’s Carol.” Amethyst greeted as she entered his building, but the only response she received was silence. “May I begin my duties?”</p>
<p>There were no signs of anyone being here, and she didn’t feel Dajals’ unpleasant gaze on her either.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps he’s gone out … That’s good. I should look for evidence while he’s not around.</em></p>
<p>Hoping that she could find something in his absence, she entered a room that appeared to be his study. Just in case, she didn’t forget to bring along the bucket, rag, and broom.</p>
<p>She placed the bucket and the broom by the door and looked around with the rag in hand. She didn’t forget to pay attention to the door lest he return.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thump! Thump! Thump!</strong></em></p>
<p>Her heart was beating rapidly. She tried to calm the throbbing that felt like it were a time bomb about to explode.</p>
<p>Generally, the study was well kept. On top of his desk were neatly arranged files of account statements. She picked up the files and flipped through them.</p>
<p>[Waterproofing of roof, Dijon Corporation, paid by Aran Bank.]</p>
<p>[Planting of trees, Amoz Corporation, Marcezon Bank to be paid.]</p>
<p>[Painting works, Dijon Corporation, paid by Aran Bank.]</p>
<p>[Repairing of walls, Dijon Corporation, paid by Aran Bank.]</p>
<p>Once the repair is completed by the subcontracted company, payment is made by the bank.</p>
<p>※</p>
<p>Quotation, repair details, repair confirmation, invoice, payment confirmation. It was a very well-organised account. It looked perfect. And this was precisely that made it even more suspicious. Except for the tree plantation, all of the work was commissioned to Dijon Corporation and payment was made by Aran Bank.</p>
<p><em>Well, if Dijon Corporation was a company that provided good service, then it was understandable. But given the size and scale of the mansion, it isn’t possible.</em></p>
<p><em>Also since it’s a construction fee, it would require a large amount of money going back and forth, so it would be natural to use the bank rather than cash…</em></p>
<p><em>But why would they choose this bank? Was it the partnered bank of the prince’s estate?</em></p>
<p><em>I think it will be faster to look into Aran bank than Dijon Corporation.</em></p>
<p>The fact that Dajal was commissioning all the work solely to Dijon Corporation, suggested that they had a close relationship. And if the two were in a transactional relationship, acting rashly could reveal that they were under scrutiny. Also, she had a hunch that the slush funds and Aran Bank had some sort of a link.</p>
<p><em>All right, there’s a need to look into this first.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst placed the files back in their original position, picked up the bucket and broom she had placed by the door, and exited the study. Since Dajal was nowhere in sight, she returned to the building where the maids were quartered.</p>
<p>As she entered the building, she saw Roman massaging her shoulders while seated in an old chair.</p>
<p>“Roman! Are you taking a rest?”</p>
<p>“Madam! Are you all right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>“I was so worried.” She must have been worried since the time she left for Dajal’s office yesterday.</p>
<p>“Today I didn’t see Dajal.”</p>
<p>“Ah, once a week he goes out. Today must be the day.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Once a week? By chance do you know where he goes?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure about that…,” said Roman shaking her head.</p>
<p><em>I wonder where he goes once a week. Is it to Aran Bank? Or Dijon Corporation? </em>Amethyst ruminated for a moment before asking Roman for a favour. “I see. Also, tomorrow I might not be able to come. So if Dajal looks for me could you tell him I am on leave?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. All right. Are you by chance not feeling well or…?” Roman asked with a worried tone.</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed and reassured her. “Not at all! I’m just being cautious in case I raise the suspicions of others. So don’t worry about me. I’ll see you soon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>Assuming that Dajal wouldn’t look for her today since he was out, Amethyst retired early to the main mansion and looked for Pon.</p>
<p>“Pon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Which bank is affiliated with the mansion?”</p>
<p>Pon seemed taken aback by the sudden question and answered her by way of a question. “Madam, may I enquire which affiliated bank you are looking for?”</p>
<p>“Which…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam. In the mansion, we use different banks for different businesses.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. There are several banks owned by His Highness….”</p>
<p>“Several?”</p>
<p>“Yes. So depending on the nature of business the banks we use differ.”</p>
<p>“I… see.”</p>
<p><em>Hahaha. This is incredible! I knew Alec wasn’t just some gold spoon… but to think he was a Vibranium spoon!</em></p>
<p>“Then is Aran Bank also owned by Alec?”</p>
<p>“No. As far as I am aware.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p><em>Phew… that’s a relief!</em></p>
<p><em>I wonder why I’m relieved that it’s not owned by him. Perhaps because it means he has nothing to do with this … Maybe that’s why?</em></p>
<p><em>For now, I need to find out more on Aran Bank.</em></p>
<p>And she knew just the person to ask about it. “Pon, tomorrow I’m thinking of visiting my family. I miss my mother.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I will make the arrangements.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Returning to her bedroom, Amethyst took a bath before settling herself on her bed. She decided to stay up until Alexcent came home, but her fatigue got the better of her and she soon fell asleep.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, Alexcent lay next to her to sleep.</p>
<p>She used to get up even at the slightest sound. But these last few days she was dead asleep and wouldn’t know even if someone were to carry her away. And he didn’t like that.</p>
<p><em>Well, I’ll just wait and observe for a little longer.</em></p>
<p>Sighing he breathed in her warm scent.</p>
<p>As he breathed in the familiar and foreign scent, he swore under his breath and pulled her closer as he too fell into deep oblivion.</p>
