            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 33 – The Big Day (2) | 19</strong></p>
<p>When it was time, Alexcent took Amethyst’s hand and led her to the center of the hall. The loud crowd died down, all eyes were on the newly wedded couple.</p>
<p>Getting down on one knee, Alexcent raised the hem of her dress. She was shocked by his sudden move, but he smoothly grabbed a hold of her leg and used the other hand to take off her heels. Since they had quite a difference in height, Amethyst had chosen to wear very high and uncomfortable heels. Her two small feet were visible momentarily before being hidden by her dress again. He stood back up and lifted her a bit and gently placed her feet atop his shoes. Then their stacked feet started to dance along to the song.</p>
<p>First step, second step, turn, and repeat.</p>
<p>Amethyst no longer had to worry about taking the wrong step or stepping on Alexcent’s feet. She simply looked up into his eyes and followed his lead, just like he had told her to. In the large hall, her shoes were neatly placed to the side just like Cinderella’s glass ones.</p>
<p>Her eyes were full of happiness and her heart fluttered around like a butterfly within. The two continued to dance across the dance floor. Whenever Alexcent lifted her up in his arms and twirled her around, her dress flowed and looked like an entire galaxy of stars. Her bright laughter filled the hall. Awed by the scene, spectators sent waves of applause their way. It was a beautiful day, as bright and glorious as her dress of flowing stars.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Even though it was late in the night, the mansion was brightly illuminated by the lights of the party. Those lights lit up the bedroom as well. Outside it was still loud and boisterous but Amethyst’s bedroom was full of silence.</p>
<p>As the party reached its peak, Amethyst was escorted to her chamber by her maids. To be more exact, to the bedroom that was now to be used by her alone. The polite maids led her to the bathroom and told her they would be helping her to get ready.</p>
<p>A sweet scent filled her nose. Inside the gold bathtub, various flowers were afloat. The maids came towards her and helped her remove the tiara and veil from her head. Then helped her out of her wedding dress, as well as the corset and undergarments she wore. Then Amethyst slipped herself into the bath, it was the perfect temperature, full of flowers that softened her skin, and scents that helped calm her down. It was the second time today that she had taken such a bath. Once in the morning and now.</p>
<p><em>‘Was the life of the prince’s wife this indulgent at all times?’</em></p>
<p>Then it occurred to her that all this might be to prepare her for the first night, making her flush.</p>
<p><em>Oh my god! No, I’m sure he will just drop by for a while before going back. I’m sure … Will he? Yes, he definitely wouldn’t stay.</em></p>
<p>Convinced by her own conclusion, Amethyst put on a thin slip dress to sleep in, wrapped a gown around before entering the bedroom. She froze when she came face to face with Alec who was also in his bathing gown. He must have just gotten out of the shower too as his wet hair glistened in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Alexcent was the first to break the silence as he approached her in large strides.</p>
<p>“Since you said you can’t be satisfied with just one man, I’ll do my best tonight.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“What are you … mmmm!”</p>
<p>Just as he reached her, Alexcent bent over and kissed her suddenly. He nibbled on her lower lip lightly making her gasp. As her lips partially parted, he used the opportunity to slip his t0ngue in and lick the inside. As warmth engulfed her senses and a sweet sensation entangled her, she let out a soft moan only to be kissed more intently.</p>
<p>Her knees buckled, Amethyst gave in completely and without a hitch. She relaxed, her mind turned hazy and she was unable to think any further. His fervent kiss drove away her last shreds of resolve and reason.</p>
<p>As she reacted to his intense kiss, his lips descended her neck and collar. She moaned and took a sharp intake of breath as she felt her body shiver when his tongue licked her skin. He was getting more excited by the sight of her soft, bare skin covered by a thin slip dress.</p>
<p>But even that frail grab was seen as an obstacle by the prince who was plunging deeper and deeper into the sea of pleasure. He ripped the dress off her just as she came up for air.</p>
<p>Before she could even take a mouthful of air, she sucked back in hard. His lips captured her one erect bud on her small mounds, his hands grop!ng them.</p>
<p>“Hmmm. Ah…mmm.”</p>
<p>Yet another m0an escaped her, as he turned his attention to her left one. His tongue lapped, touch desperate and he greedily devoured it. When the nibbling teeth took a sharp bite of her n!pple, an unbridled pleasure washed over her. An indescribable sensation settled in the pit of her stomach, spreading throughout her body like wildfire.</p>
<p>Alexcent took his time to tease her, every once in a while even eliciting a scream. Wracked by pleasure, she found herself falling deeper and deeper. His tongue explored her bre@st, while his large hand slid down to her thigh. With only her pant!es in between them, his hands started to rove over it.</p>
<p>“That’s…ah…ha.”</p>
<p>With each rub, she breathed more heavily. She felt embarrassed but found herself lifting up her hips as she continued to enjoy the sensation. Soon her last piece of clothing bid her adieu, leaving her entirely bare.</p>
<p>Then … his long, thick finger entered her depths.</p>
