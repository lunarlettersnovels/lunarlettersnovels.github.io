            <p><strong>Chapter 289</strong></p>
<p>“You are correct. You’re smarter than you look. I guess that’s why Sir Roden is keeping you around. I was curious about your worth,” Alexcent said.</p>
<p>“Does a bastard have to prove their worth to become a noble?” Loyalterre asked.</p>
<p>Alexcent laughed. “I’m not interested whether you’re bastard or a noble. I’m only interested in your worth to Sir Roden.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Loyalterre asked.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s not important you know. I’ll ask instead, why did you come here without any argument?”</p>
<p>“My reason? I came because you asked me to.”</p>
<p>Alexcent frowned. “To come here, without knowing me or my intentions, probably means that you have your own agenda.”</p>
<p>“I want to become like you.”</p>
<p>“What?” Alexcent was shocked at her answer.</p>
<p>“I want to be confident, useful, and skilled at everything I do. As I hear you are.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Alexcent asked, curious.</p>
<p>“So, I can assist Sir Roden in his work.”</p>
<p>“Are you enamored by him?”</p>
<p>“What? No! It’s not like that.” Loyalterre waved the notion off.</p>
<p>“That’s probably for the best.” If she had got in Belice’s way, he would have had to consider killing Loyalterre. “Why are you so eager to help him?”</p>
<p>“I’m a bastard. I’m someone he could just ignore. I want to repay him for being so kind and giving me a new life. I heard from Hennessey that you’re the most politically skilled noble in the Empire. I want to learn from the best.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know Hennessey, but he certainly knows what he’s talking about.”</p>
<p>“Then you’re going to help me?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Like I said before, it depends on your worth.”</p>
<p>“My worth? How can I prove that?” Loyalterre did not know what it was that he wanted.</p>
<p>“Who knows? Worth isn’t something you are born with. It’s something developed.”</p>
<p>Pon entered the meeting room, after knocking lightly. “Sir, apologies for interrupting. I know you’re in the middle of a conversation but a guest is here.”</p>
<p>“A guest?” Alexcent checked the time.</p>
<p>“Yes, Duke Roden…”</p>
<p>“Loyalterre!” Michen entered, before Pon had a chance to finish introducing him. “Are you all right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but what are you doing here?” Loyalterre blushed slightly in embarrassment.</p>
<p>MIchen took his eyes off Loyalterre and glared at Alexcent. “What is this rudeness!” he demanded.</p>
<p>“I believe you were the one who was rude first,” Alexcent exclaimed. “How dare you bring in someone without the proper status into the palace.”</p>
<p>“Her status is confirmed by me, the master of the Roden family. Isn’t that enough?”</p>
<p>“Yes, so it appears to be.” Alexcent smiled and turned to Loyalterre. “Your worth is proven. I’ll send you a message soon.”</p>
<p>“A message? What do you mean!” Michen asked, having no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>“You can hear the rest from her,” Alexcent said, standing. “I have to go to my office, so please excuse me.” Alexcent walked out, leaving Michen and Loyalterre behind.</p>
<p>Michen turned to Loyalterre. “Why did he summon you here?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. He said he wanted to check my worth. But why are you here? I thought you had important business today.”</p>
<p>Michen had completely forgotten his meeting with Belice, with his worry about Loyalterre. “Oh my god!” he panicked. “We need to get you back to the mansion quickly.”</p>
<p>Pon escorted them out of Alexcent’s home as quickly as possible</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Alexcent headed for Belice’s office when he entered the palace. A servant stopped him at the door.</p>
<p>“Tell her I am here,” Alexcent demanded.</p>
<p>“Her Majesty said not to let anyone in,” the servant replied nervously.</p>
<p>Alexcent glared at the man. “Tell her. Now!”</p>
<p>“But, my lord!”</p>
<p>“Now!”</p>
<p>The servant cowered from Alexcent’s deadly stare and turned to announce him in fear. He knocked lightly on the door. “Your Majesty, Duke Skad is here to see you.”</p>
<p>There was no answer, so Alexcent pushed the servant out of the way and opened the door.</p>
<p>“My Lord!” the servant protested.</p>
<p>“Wait here. Do not let anyone in,” Alexcent ordered, the entered the room. He followed the sounds of faint sobbing through the meeting room and into the bedroom.</p>
<p>“Belice?” he called, into the darkened room.</p>
<p>“I told the servants not to let anyone in,” Belice sobbed from the bed.</p>
<p>Alexcent entered and sat Belice up. “What is it! Why are you crying?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie. I haven’t seen you cry recently.”</p>
<p>“It’s none of your business.”</p>
<p>“I will decide that! Just tell me,” Alexcent insisted.</p>
<p>“I decided to end my infatuation with Michen today.”</p>
<p>“End it? Why?”</p>
<p>“I thought it was the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>“If it was the right thing to do, then why are you crying? Tell me straight up, what did Michen say?”</p>
<p>“He didn’t say anything. He’s just… he just…” Belice couldn’t tell Alexcent about the kiss, then Michen running of to his other woman. If she did, Alexcent would surely kill him. She started crying again. “I know that he doesn’t love me. And now I have to marry one of the candidates he suggested. It’s not fair.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Belice.” Alexcent put his arms around his sister and held her tight. What was it about love that always seemed to cause pain? Alexcent had never experienced the emotion, so he simply held Belice to comfort whatever it was that she was feeling.</p>
