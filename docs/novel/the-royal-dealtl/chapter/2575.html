            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 97 – Special Rewards (2) | 18</strong></p>
<p>He gasped. Amethyst kissed his neck and nibbled at his nape to which Alexcent let out a soft groan. She wanted him to want for more. She wanted him to feel what he always made her feel. She places kisses on his neck, then his collarbone, and down on his chest. He let out a choked breath. Amethyst was rather enjoying his every reaction, his every gasp of breath.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry Alec,” she said, “I can’t match your usual rhythm today. ‘m in a bit of a hurry over here.”</p>
<p>Acknowledging the hint of a challenge in her voice, Alexcent grabbed her and swung her to lie below him, locking her in his arms. His lips on her lips, her neck, her chest. She could feel his heat. He pinned her to the bed and traced her with kisses. His fingers entered her soft place and she gasped.</p>
<p>“Mm… Alec…,” she mumbled. She curled her toes at his sudden rough touch which sent pleasure through her body. He slid his head down between her legs and kissed her senseless. <em>He is out of his mind, </em>thought Amethyst. She could only cover her face in embarrassment.</p>
<p>He pulled his torso up and she could feel him between her legs now, completely aroused. He kissed her as he slid into her. She stiffened a little. He noticed it and kissed her gently on the forehead as his hand stroked her back to soothe her. He then thrust into her, slowly. Amethyst moaned. His movements became more aggressive, thrusting into her with vigor. She could feel the heat building.</p>
<p>“Alec!” she exclaimed. His hands were at her chest now, caressing her breasts, kissing them and nibbling on them. Amethyst couldn’t hold back her moans. As he rubbed her breasts, he thrust inside her with force. Amethyst bit her lips but the moans escaped. The more he heard her moan, the more aggressive he became until it was all sweet frenzy and Amethyst couldn’t help but scream in pleasure.</p>
<p>Amethyst’s body was moving violently, roughly, and harshly, too much that it seemed her small figure was about to break into pieces.</p>
<p><em>I will love her to the point where she can’t even leave the bed. So, she won’t be able to leave me, </em>thought Alexcent with a moan escaping his lips.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Alexcent, who seemed to be in a good mood for a while, was extremely upset now. After entering the palace, he was aloof and prone to slightest provocation. Marquis Gravia wasn’t a fan of Alexcent’s anger either. He knocked softly on the door to Alexcent’s office.</p>
<p>“Come in,” came the harsh and curt reply.</p>
<p>Count Lohikin opened the door and entered the room. “Are you free for a moment, Your Excellency?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, welcome,” said Alexcent softening his tone a little. “Of course, please come in.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said the Count.</p>
<p>The servant brought in tea in a tray and served it to both of them. “Please help yourself,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Lohikin.</p>
<p>Both gentlemen were known for their reserved nature, so an awkward silence spread between them.</p>
<p>“You seem rather upset,” notice Count Lohikin.</p>
<p>“Oh, there is nothing to worry about,” said Alexcent, “Just a personal matter.”</p>
<p>Lohikin worried if his daughter had done something wrong. <em>Did Amethyst make a mistake? </em>He thought, worriedly. “Everyone seems rather worried,” he said.</p>
<p>“They are just worried I might lose my cool and lash out at them,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>Lohikin put down the teacup. He was a straightforward person and never knew how to ask question in indirect manner. “Did my daughter do something wrong?” he asked, “If she did, then I apologize on her behalf. Please forgive her.”</p>
<p>Alexcent looked at him and sighed. “No,” he said, “It’s not Amethyst. She could never do anything wrong.”</p>
<p>Lohikin was still looking at Alexcent, unconvinced. “She is doing great, I am doing great as well,” assured Alexcent, “Things between us has been more than fine. Please don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Then as a count, I will do everything in my power to help solve whatever problem you face,” said Lohikin.</p>
<p>“I lost something precious, and I am unable to find it,” said Alexcent, “Please don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Hm,” said Lohikin, “Was it very important?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Alexcent. “It is very important to me. I hope I can find it soon.”</p>
<p>Lohikin thought that the item must have been very rare if Alexcent was this worried about it. “I am sure you will find it,” assured Lohikin. Alexcent nodded.</p>
<p>After a few, simple small-talks, Gen announced that the parliament was about to begin. The two gentlemen left their seats for the meeting. But even after Congress, Alexcent’s spirit did not improve.</p>
<p>He had told Lohikin everything was alright, but it really was not. Alexcent didn’t utter a single word in the meeting, just sat their slumping with a frown. The Duke was in a bad mood and nobody wanted to contest that. They looked at each other cautiously, hoping for the meeting to end as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Gen, noticing this, stepped behind Alexcent’s chair. He leaned down to whisper in his ear. “Have you searched for it everywhere?” he whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Everywhere? Your clothes? Drawers?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Alexcent replied.</p>
<p>“Still couldn’t find it?”</p>
<p>“Can’t you tell from my mood?”</p>
<p>“Well, I am glad that you are aware that you are in a bad mood. Everyone is at edge seeing you like this.”</p>
<p>“I swear I had it on me this morning,” said Alexcent, “Where could it possibly go?”</p>
<p>“Maybe check back at your residence once again,” suggested Gen.</p>
<p>“Hm,” he mumbled, “You think it will be there?”</p>
<p>“Most likely,” said Gen.</p>
<p>Alexcent stood up. “Let’s call it a day. Meeting is dismissed.”</p>
<p>Members of the Congress looked gratefully at Gen, for having saved them all from His Grumpiness. As Alexcent hurried out of the office to his residence, the people whispered among themselves.</p>
<p>“I heard him say that he lost something,” one whispered.</p>
