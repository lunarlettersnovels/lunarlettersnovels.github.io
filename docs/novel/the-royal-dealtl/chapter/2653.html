            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 20 – Love at First Sight (2)</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Count Lohikin had called on Amethyst and was at an utter loss for words. He desperately wanted to say something but didn’t seem like he could bring himself to do so.</p>
<p>Observing the Count, Amethyst was the first to speak. “Will you consent? Tomorrow, Duke Skad will come by to greet you and to formally ask for my hand in marriage.”</p>
<p>The count must have been shocked by the statement as his frown deepened.</p>
<p>“Amethyst, have you done something wrong to the duke? Are you in debt? Tell me honestly, is there anything father can do to help?”</p>
<p>“No! It’s just that, he…he lo—loves…”</p>
<p><em>She should say he loved her right</em>?</p>
<p>Amethyst blushed scarlet at the thought of saying it out loud.</p>
<p>“Is it true? Why does Duke Skad feel that way towards you?” asked her father, frowning, finding it strangely hard to believe.</p>
<p>“Father!”</p>
<p>“No, I mean there were no encounters so far. Hmm, anyway. So that must be why you rejected the previous marriage offers. As a duke, he is a member of the royal family. You must treat him with utmost respect at all times.”</p>
<p>“Father, I am not going to serve him as a maid. I am getting married to him.”</p>
<p>“Well, that is true too… But we are talking about the Duke of Skad. We can’t forget that.” Count Lohikin fell deep in thought before continuing once more. “Well, since you say that you are in love, it should not be a problem. As long as you live well. I had been deeply worried because you said you didn’t ever want to get married a few days ago, so it is a relief. Alright, so you are going to stay at the duke’s estate until the marriage?”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, she was reminded of how her real father, who had been indifferent to all her life, had shed a tear on the day of her wedding. Even her real father, who had been cold towards her had acted as such.</p>
<p>Count Lohikin, on the other hand, was heavily invested in his family and was a warm and loving father to his children. She couldn’t help but wonder momentarily, if she was making the right decision for the real Amethyst, the real daughter of the Count.</p>
<p>She felt guilty at her choice of action, one that she had made purely for her own convenience. But the moment she had answered Duke Skad, the decision had been irrevocably made.</p>
<p>As long as the real Amethyst did not return, and as long as she remained, things would suit her convenience.</p>
<p>Amethyst approached Count Lohikin and hugged him. “Don’t worry, I’ll be nice. Duke Skad said it would be better for me to stay at his estate for my own safety. And that it would be good for me to learn and prepare myself for what awaits me when I become his wife….”</p>
<p>Count Lohikin patted Amethyst’s hands, as though to say he understood.</p>
<p>Regardless of the situation, this was her family for now; the only people who cared for her unselfishly. It would be better to put some distance between them before she became too fond of them.</p>
<p>This would be the best in preparation of what was inevitably going to happen in one year’s time.</p>
<p>“Father, thank you. And I am sorry.”</p>
<p>He brushed it off, “Haha, what a thing to say.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The next day, Amethyst got up early to get ready, and sat waiting for Duke Skad’s arrival as a precautionary measure; she had no idea when he might arrive.</p>
<p>Not quite unexpectedly, the duke arrived early in the morning.</p>
<p>Escorted by the Count’s butler, the moment he entered the main hall of the house, as if she had been lying in wake of him, Amethyst sprinted towards him with open arms and embraced him tightly.</p>
<p>“Alec!”</p>
<p>Alexcent stared dumbfounded at Amethyst, who came running towards him, calling out his name, muttering under his breath, ‘Did she eat something wrong yesterday?’</p>
<p>She hugged the duke’s waist tightly and whispered surreptitiously in his ear.</p>
<p>“I finally convinced my father by telling him that we are desperate to get married because we are soooo in love, so play along, alright? Remember the conditions, never to get caught and be nice to one another’s family!”</p>
<p>She thought she heard a low groan, but Duke Skad immediately put on a fake loving smile and looked at Amethyst with adoration clear in his sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, my Ash! How happy I was on my way here from the estate!”</p>
<p>He spoke loudly and bending down, punctuated each word with a kiss on Amethyst’s apricot-colored lips.</p>
<p>The kiss was unexpected. Amethyst, startled, tried to push him away, but as though he had expected her to, he hugged her even more tightly and pressed his lips intensely against hers.</p>
<p>“Ahem.” Behind them, Count Lohikin coughed dryly, not quite pleased witnessing the tableau they presented, while on his right, Countess Lohikin looked at them, beaming from ear to ear.</p>
<p>“Oh my, you already have a pet-name for each other!”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“I simply did what you wanted me to.”</p>
<p>“What? I never told you to kiss my lips, I just told you to play along!”</p>
<p>After they left the Count’s house, Duke Skad and Amethyst quarrelled in the carriage, back to their usual selves.</p>
<p>“That’s the same thing. Who was the one who said we are getting married because we are in love? Besides, kissing isn’t the only thing married couples do.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“Then did you think we would go to sleep only holding hands?”</p>
<p>Scandalized, she gasped, “We never talked about such things in the contract!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it obvious, I mean, we’re getting married! You were the one who said you can’t be satisfied with one man. So, don’t pretend to be an innocent and naive young lady.”</p>
<p><em>‘When did I ever say that?’ </em>Amethyst blushed scarlet at that, and cried in indignation, “I didn’t mean it like that!”</p>
<p><em>‘He seems to have misunderstood. No, I think I have created a misunderstanding.’</em></p>
<p>She contemplated how to resolve the issue, but the duke spoke first,</p>
<p>“I wonder who said no woman or man during the contract period? Do you expect me to be alone for a whole year?”</p>
<p>‘<em>Uhh… Yes?’</em></p>
<p>She was at a loss of words. His words weren’t entirely wrong. But even so it was beyond her. Her mind might belong to Heeyeon, but her body belonged solely to Amethyst.</p>
