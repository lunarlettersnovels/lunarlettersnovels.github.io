            <p><strong>Chapter 275</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst wasn’t sure how the luncheon went, as she had been in a daze the entire time. It must have gone well, as it was supposed to be simple and short but ended up going into the night.  It was late before they finally sent off the empress and the Lohikins.</p>
<p>She took her tired body and relaxed in the hot bathtub. Then she went into the bedroom and threw herself onto the bed.</p>
<p>Alexcent entered as she was drifting off. Amethyst mumbled into her pillow “I’m tired tonight.”</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Alexcent grabbed her shoulders roughly and turned her over. She opened her eyes in shock to stare into his face. His eyes were so cold and aggressive. They actually scared her a little.</p>
<p>“Alec?”</p>
<p>Alexcent kissed her with force. Amethyst tried to say something, but he didn’t give her the chance. He ignored her struggling and ripped off the underwear that was covering her.</p>
<p>“Alec! No! Stop!”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I’m tired!”</p>
<p>“Tired? When aren’t you tired?”</p>
<p>“Alec, what’s wrong? This isn’t like you. I’m scared.” She could feel his threatening breath on her. This felt more like rape than the precursor to passion.</p>
<p>“You should’ve just said what was on your mind,” Alexcent snarled.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Is it that horrifying, the thought of having my child?”</p>
<p>Amethyst’s eyes widened as his words. Alexcent took it as proof. “I thought it might not be true, but apparently it is.”</p>
<p>“No! Alec, it’s not like that!”</p>
<p>“That was why. I thought it was strange. The reason you avoided me for a few days every month. I knew it wasn’t during your menstruation cycle. You were trying to avoid the period when you were most likely to be fertile!”</p>
<p>“That’s… Alec, listen to me.”</p>
<p>“No, there’s no need. It’s true! That was why!”</p>
<p>“That’s not it!”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to have a child with a man who is considered a monster!”</p>
<p>“Alec!! Monster? That’s not true!”</p>
<p>“I’ll do what you want. I always do what you want.”</p>
<p>“What is that supposed to mean?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“Who knows? You should know the best. Good night, Amethyst.” Alexcent gave a peck on her forehead and ran out of the bedroom. There was gust of wind that came through the opened door.</p>
<p><em>We weren’t supposed to be separate anymore</em>, Amethyst thought. <em>I thought there would only be happiness in our future. I made him misunderstand again. It wasn’t like that. I didn’t mean it like that. I was just scared.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst spent the night alone, sleepless with her thoughts.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After that night, Alexcent didn’t come to Amethyst anymore. He would arrive back at the mansion, when it was late at night, and head straight to his office instead of the bedroom. It had been several nights of this same routine.</p>
<p>“Did he say he was going to be late tonight too?” Amethyst asked Pon.</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am. He said he has a lot of work to do, so don’t wait up.”</p>
<p>“Where is he now?”</p>
<p>“The palace, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Take me there.”</p>
<p>“Ma’am, it’s late. You should go to sleep. When the sun comes up…”</p>
<p>“He comes home late on purpose and goes into the palace before I even wake up! He’s clearly avoiding me!” Amethyst was furious. “So, take me to him! I can’t stand it anymore!”</p>
<p>She thought that she could wait until he came home and solve this misunderstanding by talking, but he avoided her on purpose. She couldn’t wait any longer. She had no intention of being apart from him anymore. No matter what the reason was.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Alexcent was sitting at a table at a men’s only club, with a glass of whisky. He didn’t enjoy drinking usually, but it wasn’t like he couldn’t. He was monitoring his intake though, as Amethyst didn’t like the smell of alcohol. The word ‘monster’ kept running through his head. He didn’t think his past would still haunt him.</p>
<p>He destroyed everyone in the past so there could be no hope of someone coming after him for revenge. In truth, they were unforgivable murders. He became evil at one point and was truthfully a monster. He worried that his past was taking over once more.</p>
<p>The woman he loved the most, even she looked at him as if he was a monster. No matter how hard he tried, he would always be a being of evil disguised as a human.</p>
<p>Amethyst wasn’t from this world to begin with, and she already had children in her previous life. For her to refuse a child there could only be one reason. It was because of him.</p>
<p>Alexcent downed his glass of whiskey in one gulp. <em>Since when did I want a child</em>, he thought.<em> Why am I so angry? </em>A vision of a child standing next to Amethyst appeared in front of him. <em>It would have been nice if the child looked like her. How pathetic am I?</em></p>
<p>Gen carefully approached Alexcent, who was clearly intoxicated. “Sir, I’m sorry to bother you but I think you should head back to the mansion.”</p>
