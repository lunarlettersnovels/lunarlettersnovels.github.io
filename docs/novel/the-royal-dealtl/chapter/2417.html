            <p><strong>Chapter 251</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent wore the first outfit he had tried on and the dress shoes that they bought yesterday. He wore a black apron that Amethyst had insisted on buying. Amethyst was waiting for him as he came downstairs in the uniform.</p>
<p>“Looks good! The completion of fashion is the face!” she announced.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that dress shoes were the completion, yesterday?” Alexcent grumbled.</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed. “You know what I mean.”</p>
<p>Amethyst stood in front of him and fixed his hair, avoiding looking him directly in the eyes. Then she opened the buttons on his sleeves and folded them back twice. Then she opened the top two buttons of his shirt. Revealing his muscles and his striking eyes completed the ensemble. Alexcent just stood there and allowed himself to be manipulated like a doll.</p>
<p>“Perfect. Let’s have a busy and productive day today!” she said, smiling.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It seemed like Amethyst’s plan worked and Alexcent’s popularity skyrocketed. The three tables were not enough to accommodate all of the guests and people had to eat their meals in the chairs on the outdoor terrace. For the first time ever, the café closed its doors on waiting guests because they ran out of food.</p>
<p>Amethyst was resting at one of the tables, as Alexcent was cleaning dishes in the kitchen, when the front door opened to the chime of the bells.</p>
<p>Amethyst began to turn the customer away. “Sorry, we’re closed for…” She turned to see that it was Pauline and Erina.</p>
<p>“Auntie!” Erina cried, running in for a hug.</p>
<p>“Hello Erina!” Amethyst said, embracing the girl.</p>
<p>“Auntie, why did you close early yesterday?” Erina asked. “I wanted to see you, but the café was locked.”</p>
<p>“I had an errand to run in the city, so we closed early! I’m sorry I missed you.” Amethyst kissed Erina on the cheek.</p>
<p>Alexcent came out and lifted Erina in a big hug.</p>
<p>“She’s getting heavy,” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Pauline laughed. The girl wasn’t really that heavy, but his comment made Erina smile.</p>
<p>“Did you know you’re the hot topic nowadays?” Pauline asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Me?” Amethyst seemed shocked.</p>
<p>“No, the café! Actually, Gray, to be precise.” Pauline said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Did you know that every customer today was a woman?” Amethyst asked. “I’m glad that sales are up, but I feel a little bitter.” She gave a sly smile to Alexcent. He stood next to her, blushing.</p>
<p>“I’m sure it’s probably because your cooking is so good. That’s why they keep coming back.” Pauline tried to control her laughter.</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed instead. “Is that so? Then, come sit. I’ll make you something delicious!”</p>
<p>“I love your cooking! Mom, let’s eat here! Please?!” Erina jumped up and down.</p>
<p>Pauline nodded to her child, and Alexcent pulled out a chair for her.</p>
<p>“Please sit,” he said politely</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Pauline replied. Alexcent then lifted Erina into the chair next to her before following Amethyst into the kitchen to see what they could make with the few ingredients they had left.</p>
<p>Pauline had been opposed to Gray working here at first. He had been a slave and a criminal. At first, she had thought Carol was infatuated with his looks, but as she saw how he stood by Carol and took care of her, her feelings had begun to change.</p>
<p>Amethyst and Alexcent brought out plates of whatever food there was remaining, and the dinner celebration began.</p>
<p>There was nothing like the company of good people. Pauline kept complaining about Erina’s silly actions, but they made Amethyst laughed. Alexcent even smiled as he made sure everyone had enough food. When the meal was completed, Amethyst stood to remove the empty dishes, but Alexcent placed a hand on her arm and rose.</p>
<p>“You can stay seated,” Amethyst said.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind doing it,” Alexcent insisted.</p>
<p>“You’ve done enough today. Rest.”</p>
<p>Pauline stood up as well. “Yes, stay seated. I’ll help.”</p>
<p>Pauline grabbed the rest of the dishes and took them into the kitchen with Amethyst. Once the dinner dishes were rinsed, Amethyst took a cake out of the refrigerator for dessert.</p>
<p>“I saved Erina’s favourite cake,” Amethyst told Pauline.</p>
<p>“How are things lately?” Pauline asked her friend.</p>
<p>“What are you referring to?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“You two,” Pauline said, indicating Alexcent in the dining room.</p>
<p>“Gray and me? It’s good. He listens to my ideas, does his work well, and is not so bad to look at as well.”</p>
<p>“Even though he’s a slave, he seems like a good person,” Pauline said.</p>
<p>“He definitely is kind,” Amethyst agreed as she started dishing slices of cake. “I really don’t know where I would be if it wasn’t for Gray.”</p>
<p>Amethyst looked up and could see Pauline smirking. “It’s not like that,” Amethyst said, blushing.</p>
<p>“Not like what?” Pauline asked, snickering.</p>
<p>“What you’re thinking in your head. It’s not like that.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say anything.” Pauline was laughing outright now. “I didn’t think of anything.”</p>
<p>“Fine then,” Amethyst said, returning to the cake.</p>
<p>“But is it really not like that? How about….”</p>
<p>“Pauline!” Amethyst whispered forcefully. “Do you know what the age difference is between Gray and me? At least ten years!” Even though Amethyst looked young, Gray was certainly younger. “Anyways, he’s like a sibling to me. A younger brother! Nothing more and nothing less. So, stop with these ridiculous ideas!”</p>
<p>Amethyst thrust a dish with cake into Pauline’s hands. “Let’s go eat cake.”</p>
<p>“All right,” Pauline said sheepishly.</p>
<p>After dessert was eaten, Pauline and Erina put on their coats, and Alexcent unlocked the front door to let them out.</p>
<p>“It’s going to rain tomorrow. Make sure to have an umbrella,” Alexcent mentioned as he hugged Erina goodbye.</p>
<p>Pauline hadn’t heard of any mention of rain and the sky that evening was clear. “Rain? Really?”</p>
<p>“If Gray says so, it’s going to be true,” Amethyst mentioned as she gave her goodbyes. “He’s weirdly good at guessing weather.”</p>
<p>“All right, I’ll make sure to have my umbrella. Thanks, Gray.” Alexcent nodded and the two ladies headed for home.</p>
<p>Amethyst asked Alexcent, as he was locking up, “I am curious, how are you able to predict the weather so accurately?”</p>
<p>“The smell of the air changes,” Alexcent said, as if it was common knowledge.</p>
<p>Amethyst took a few sniffs to see if she could detect anything. “I can’t tell any difference.”</p>
<p>“The outcome of a battle is dependent on weather. It was always important to tell the differences in air.” Amethyst had another clue of Gray’s mysterious past. He must have been a knight at some point.</p>
<p>“Go up and get some sleep.,” Alexcent said. “I’ll take care of the rest of the cleanup.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
