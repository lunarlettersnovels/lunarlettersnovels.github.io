            <p><strong>Chapter 276</strong></p>
<p>“Why?” Alexcent slurred.</p>
<p>“Well, ma’am is saying that she needs to see you right away. I told her that you were working, but she insisted on going to the palace. They’re trying to delay her, but…”</p>
<p>Gen wasn’t able to finish before Alexcent slapped his own face to sober up, then rose and headed back to the mansion. The moment he walked in; he could hear Amethyst yelling.</p>
<p>“If you can’t bring a carriage, bring me a horse. Now!”</p>
<p>“Ma’am, a horse is dangerous to ride with the sun going down,” Pon informed her.</p>
<p>“Fine! I’ll walk then! Move!”</p>
<p>“Ma’am, I’ll take you tomorrow.” Pon insisted. “Tonight just…”</p>
<p>“Everyone is dismissed,” Alexcent ordered, entering the room. Pon, Lunia, and the other servants quickly left.</p>
<p>Amethyst looked at Alexcent, with his rumpled clothes and a bit of a sway in his stance.</p>
<p>“Alec, were you drinking?” she asked.</p>
<p>“A little.”</p>
<p>Amethyst’s heart fluttered as she saw him for the first time in a while. Though his hair was a mess, he was still incredibly handsome. But his cold voice hid something sinister and angry.</p>
<p>“Alec, please sit. I have something to say.” Amethyst pointed to a chair.</p>
<p>“It’s late. Let’s talk tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Alec, sit! It’ll only take a moment!”</p>
<p>Amethyst reached for his arm to move him to the chair, but Alexcent pulled away. His refusal to be near her became too much and she began to cry.</p>
<p>Alexcent sighed and he turned to her. “Damn it, Ash, don’t cry.” His words only caused her to start sobbing louder. “Ash.”</p>
<p>“I knew nothing about the rumours about you before I came here! But why are you saying these things? Why are you being so cold? I was just afraid. No about you, but about me! I was afraid!” Amethyst continued sobbing, as she choked on the words. “I was afraid that I might not become a good mother. That I might not have the right. I was just scared, so scared.”</p>
<p>“Ash…” Alexcent tried to interrupt.</p>
<p>“You know nothing about what it feels like to become a mother. That I might yell at the child, might hit the child, that I might be a bad mother. You don’t know how scary that is! That I might get angry, just because the child is being a picky eater, or that the child is messing up the house. If the child is crying all night, I might yell to stop the crying. I’m scared that I might be a bad mother.”</p>
<p>“There’s no way you would be,” Alexcent said, trying to comfort her.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t born with motherly love to begin with. That’s why I came to this world. You don’t know how scary it is for a person like me to have a child. I can’t be certain that it is right for me to be a mother. So, I need some time. When I’m ready…”</p>
<p>“Ash. There’s not a right way to be a parent. What you said is true, fatherly love should be the same as motherly love. But look at me, that’s not the case. It’s ludicrous to say fatherly love and motherly love to begin with. That’s not the way it is. Everyone tries their best. That’s what love is. Doing it together.”</p>
<p>“Together?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Together. We just have to do this together.”</p>
<p>Amethyst stopped crying. She looked at Alexcent as she wiped away the moisture with the back of her hand. It was the most ironic thing for him to say the words that even he wasn’t certain about, just to comfort her.</p>
<p>“You’re going to help me?” Amethyst asked. “I’m not good enough. I can’t do this on my own, but by my side, with you helping me…”</p>
<p>“Ash. That’s not the right way to say it. I’m not helping you. We’re doing it together. That’s what a family is.”</p>
<p>“Together.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Together.”</p>
<p>Amethyst felt like the impenetrable wall that held her back collapsed at the word ‘together.’ She looked deeply into Alexcent’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Alec. You’re not a monster. No matter what people may say, you’re not a monster. I hope you don’t think like that anymore.”</p>
<p>“I will try,” He said, smiling as if unsure.</p>
<p>“Besides, I’ve never seen or heard of a monster that looks as handsome as you. Only in books are monsters ugly.”</p>
<p>Alexcent laughed and took Amethyst in his embrace. She said he wasn’t a monster. And, even though it was only the opinion of one person, he felt like his life had just been saved.</p>
<p>Amethyst, after feeling relieved to be in his arms once more, quietly whispered his name.</p>
<p>“Yes?” he asked gently.</p>
<p>“Promise me to never run away again, and that we will always tell each how we feel. Even when we’re angry at each other. The reason why we drifted apart, and why we had to take the long way back to each other this time, was because of a stupid misunderstanding since we didn’t talk. We’ll definitely be fighting more in the future, so let’s not run away from each other next time.”</p>
<p>“All right.” He embraced her once more.</p>
<p>Marriage is when two people, who’ve been living different lifestyles, come together and adjust to being around each other all the time. Amethyst was only realizing the necessity of this now when Alec had said about them being together. She knew now that she did not need to run away anymore.</p>
<p>“Alec, thank you.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“For saying ‘together’.”</p>
<p>“It was obvious.”</p>
<p>There was only one thing Amethyst wanted and that was him. <em>You’re the only one who’s looked at me for what I really am. Just you.</em> Amethyst finally felt complete.</p>
<p>Amethyst breathed calmly in his arms, her mind clearing. Then she looked up into his eyes and said, “Alec. I love you. I will always love you.”</p>
<p>“Ash, we’re always going to love each other,” he replied.</p>
<p>Always together. Those words defined everything that was in her heart. She whispered softly in his arms. “We’re always going to be together.”</p>
