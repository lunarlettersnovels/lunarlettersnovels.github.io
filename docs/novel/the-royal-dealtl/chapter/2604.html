            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 69</strong></p>
<p>She thought to herself as she soaked herself in.</p>
<p><em>Dajal was aware of the fact that I don’t enjoy wearing any undergarments. He who doesn’t even come near the main mansion… Which could only mean that one of the maids acted as his source of information. I must pay more attention to my dressing and manner of speaking.</em></p>
<p>He was also aware of the incident where she had reprimanded a knight for harassing a maid, so excluding the main mansion under Pon’s care, there wasn’t a part of the estate that didn’t have Dajal’s eyes and ears.</p>
<p><em>And to add on, to think that Aran Bank belonged to Alec.</em></p>
<p>The sound of water coming out from the showerhead failed to block out the noises in her head. Just when she started to feel nauseous from all the thoughts going on in her head.</p>
<p><em><strong>Knock, knock!</strong></em></p>
<p>She heard a knock on the door of the bathroom.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>A maid relayed a message from outside of the bathroom.</p>
<p>“Madam, His Lordship wishes to dine in the dining room tonight.”</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Normally, she ate at the table in her bedroom and he had never commented or disapproved of it. So for him to have dinner in the dining room could only mean that he was still angry, and had no intention of coming into the bedroom tonight.</p>
<p><em>Let’s not get emotional like before. And try to have a calm conversation…</em></p>
<p>She repeated to herself.</p>
<p>“All right. I’m done washing up and about to change so lend me a hand.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>The maid called the other maids that were waiting and assisted Amethyst who had come out of the bathroom. They quickly prepared the usual high waisted silhouette and simple dress.</p>
<p>“No, bring the corset as well. And for the dress, something more… fancy, right, the pale yellow dress I bought before will do.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>With the help of the maids, Amethyst tightened the corset around her and wore the yellow dress she had recently bought. The dress tapered downwards, which accentuated the curves of her hips and waist.</p>
<p><em>This should do, </em>thought Amethyst. She was ready to face Alexcent a second time. She looked at Alexcent, who was already at the dining table looking comfortable. He was wearing black pants, and a white shirt with a few buttons undone, which revealed his Adam’s apple and his collarbone.</p>
<p>She felt her heart race. She tried to take her eyes off from his collarbone and looked at the whiskey in his hand. He was seated at the head of the long table. When he saw Amethyst approach, he seemed taken aback. But he took a sip from the glass he was holding and pretended to maintain a calm composure.</p>
<p>The room was throbbing with tension, as though even a spark could make both explode at any time. Amethyst sat facing him at the other end of the table, instead of next to him. She thought she saw him attempting a smile, but it could have been her imagination. He indicated to Pon to serve the food.</p>
<p>Pon served the food with all grace and elegance. Amethyst looked at the food in front of her. It was steak. He must have instructed the chef to prepare her favourite food, maybe to placate her and have the upper hand in this confrontation. It was prepared almost lovingly with her favorite sauce. <em>Damn it, </em>she cursed.</p>
<p>Amethyst pretended to be unfazed. She took up the fork and the knife and sliced her meat. The aroma was irresistible, and it made some of her anxiety melt away. Alexcent was quick to notice this.</p>
<p>“So, tell me,” he said, taking advantage of the situation, “What are you angry about?”</p>
<p>“You first,” retorted Amethyst.</p>
<p>Alexcent heaved a sigh. “Ash,” he said wearily, “Please don’t try to provoke me. I am already holding back, as it is.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” she snapped, “Were you aware of all the tyranny that Dajal committed on the maids?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he answered.</p>
<p>“And you had ample evidence of his crimes,” she added.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he replied.</p>
<p>“Then why?” asked Amethyst, “Tell me why you didn’t take any action against him?”</p>
<p>“Why would I do that?”</p>
<p>Amethyst was stunned. “He was committing a crime, you daft dimbo,” she retorted.</p>
<p>“His crimes led him to keep the slush funds safe in my bank, where they belong,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Ah, in the end, it is all because of money!” said Amethyst venomously, “Aran Bank and all its glorious black money. I am not even surprised that there is such a bank under your name. What about the maids? How could you keep quiet about that and do nothing?”</p>
<p>“Did any of them find it important to report to me about it?” asked Alexcent, coldly.</p>
<p><em>How could he ask that? </em>Amethyst thought in anger. “What?” she asked, unable to fathom his words.</p>
<p>“All of them tolerated his tyranny,” he said in a dead-pan voice, “If even one of them had reported it to me, I would have taken swift action. I couldn’t punish him without receiving complaints or accusations. He would have just accused me of ‘exploitation of power’ instead. Without the victims coming forward, I had no reason to take action.”</p>
<p>“But you had the evidence!” she exclaimed, “You knew everything! Don’t try the ‘victim-blaming’ with me. You think the maids had a choice. You saw what happened today. The same thing happened to them whenever they tried to report it! You had a choice. You had the authority, and you did nothing.” Her voice was etched with disappointment.</p>
<p>“Ash…,” said Alexcent softly, “Why are you so worried about them? They are just employees on contract working beneath us. Don’t get so sentimental.”</p>
<p>“Then I suppose I am no different to you,” she retorted, angrily, “Since you and I have a similar contract.”</p>
<p>“Don’t…,” he said, “Ash, you are different from them.”</p>
<p>“No I am not,” she snapped, “I am also a woman who has nothing here except being tied to that contract so you have to protect me like you did today. You are the one responsible for me, as you are for them! Your ‘employees’ will be here longer than me. I will disappear in a year. You should pay attention and take up your responsibilities more seriously with them.”</p>
<p>“Disappear?” said Alexcent.</p>
