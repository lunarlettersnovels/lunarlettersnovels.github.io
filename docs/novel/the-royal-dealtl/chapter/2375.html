            <p><strong>Chapter 293</strong></p>
<p>As Alexcent walked into Amethyst’s room, after showering that night, he found Amethyst sitting quietly on the bed.</p>
<p>“Alec, come sit here next to me.” She patted a spot beside her.</p>
<p>He sat down beside her. His hard muscles flashed through the opening of his robe. Amethyst stared in lust at them, for a moment, then shook her head and looked up to Alexcent’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Pon told me today that you aren’t going to hold the annual festival?”</p>
<p>“It’s as you heard,” Alexcent replied.</p>
<p>“You’re getting rid of it?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“More like skipping over it.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Just because.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean just because? It’s because of me, isn’t it?” Amethyst was mad.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>She stared into his eyes. “Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was suspicious. Sometimes she thought Alexcent tried too hard to be considerate of her, and excluded her in important decisions. She hated it, as she felt she was being treated like a stranger. Like someone not of this world. She decided not to point this out, as she thought it might start a fight.</p>
<p>Without raising her voice, she said “Then I guess that’s it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about the annual festival.”</p>
<p>“All right. I wanted to see it. How unfortunate,” Amethyst mumbled.</p>
<p>Alexcent’s shoulders flinched at Amethyst’s words.</p>
<p>“I wanted to see everyone,” Amethyst continued. “I was very excited that I’d be able to see them at the annual festival. They’re the first friends I had since I came here. Count Glacias is a little annoying, to be honest. But he did apologize later.”</p>
<p>Alexcent sighed, realizing he had made a mistake.</p>
<p>“Alec, I want to see everyone,” Amethyst insisted.</p>
<p>Alexcent didn’t say anything for a while, as he stared into her eager eyes. Finally, he made a decision.</p>
<p>“All right. Just don’t overdo the celebrating. It’s only been a few days since you collapsed.”</p>
<p>“That’s because all night you didn’t let me sleep!” Amethyst glared at him like it was his fault.</p>
<p>“And?” Alexcent opened his robe in one smooth motion. The muscles beneath still had a sheen from his recent shower.</p>
<p>Amethyst gulped in spite of herself, as her body started tingling. She was just like Pavolv’s dog. One look at his body and she immediately got horny. She tried to deny the feelings inside, out of embarrassment, and moved to crawl out of bed. Alexcent pulled her back in and she gave in to his embrace.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As Alexcent was heading to a congress session, he heard the name ‘Lohikin’ spoken in a conversation from below the balcony he was standing on.</p>
<p>“It’s real?” a man asked, laughing. “Who would’ve thought that the Lady Lohikin would become the Duchess then?”</p>
<p>Alexcent stopped walking and stared down at the group of men who were unaware of his presence above.</p>
<p>“My Lord?” Gen asked, wondering why Alexcent had stopped.</p>
<p>Alexcent quickly hushed Gen. From what Gen could see, Alexcent’s eyes were slowly glazing over with fury.</p>
<p>“I know, right?” The second man seemed very full of himself. “I even got a love letter from her. It was so detailed. I can show you next time, if you don’t believe me.”</p>
<p>“Really?” the first man questioned.</p>
<p>“Of course, why would I lie about this!”</p>
<p>The first man laughed in disbelief. “A lover letter from the Duchess. How about that?”A group of nobles listened in interest to the two men’s conversation. The bragging man appeared to be enjoying the attention.</p>
<p>“She probably would blush if she sees me. It’s hard to forget first love,” the man said.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true. But first love of a Duchess? I’m jealous.”</p>
<p>Alexcent smiled, his heart fully intent on killing the man who spoke lies. To Gen, when Alexcent smiled like that, instead of showing anger, it was even scarier.</p>
<p>“Gen.” Alexcent growled the name. “Who is that bastard?”</p>
<p>“It’s Count Zaizen, who recently came into the title. He’s been studying abroad and appeared to have lost touch with reality on his return.”</p>
<p>“Find these love letters from Lady Lohikin this bastard supposedly has. All of them. Bring them to me. Then arrange for Count Zaizen’s death. As painful as possible.”</p>
<p>Alexcent strode away after giving his order. Gen glanced at Count Zaizen and shook his head. The man would die, simply from not being able to control his tongue.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Ma’am, the master will be arriving soon.”</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded to the servant, closed the book she was reading, and tidied her hair in a mirror. She exited her chambers and headed to the main gate. As she exited the front door, she saw Alexcent stepping out of a carriage. She smiled and waved to him.</p>
<p>Alexcent bounded towards her and picked her up in a tight hug. He seemed to be showing more possessiveness today, even though she came out to greet him every day. She patted his back to release her, as his squeeze was making it difficult for her to breathe.</p>
<p>“Alec? Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“No.” Alexcent finally let her go, as she sounded worried. He kissed her forehead. “I just really missed you today.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? You just saw me this morning.”</p>
<p>“I know. It seems like I’m obsessed.”</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed. “Let’s go in.” Taking his hand, they entered the mansion.</p>
