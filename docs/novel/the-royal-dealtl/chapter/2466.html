            <p><strong>Chapter 202</strong></p>
<p>The night was dark, as the stars lay hidden behind a cover of clouds. She could not make out the sea that lay in front of her. It was like her future. Nothing but the wind and the sound of waves crashing into the cliffs. She lifted her face to the breeze to cool her aching head. <em>Do I really have anything to go back to in my old world? </em>she thought. She could go back at any time, but was there a point?</p>
<p>The darkness overtook her then. She took a step up on to the balcony wall. Standing teetering on the edge, she ignored the danger that lay one step in front of her. The waves and the rocks beneath her beckoned, as if they were ready to accept her into their embrace.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were a jumble. <em>Let me go back. If I disappear from this world, then I can go back. I need to go back now! I will no longer long for Alex and there will be no more pain.</em></p>
<p>She wobbled on the wall, barely able to keep her balance, when a thought struck her. <em>What if I can’t go back?</em> <em>What if everything, instead, just ends? </em>A wave of fear overtook her. A gust of wind almost toppled her from the rampart and she hurriedly stepped back on to the balcony, crying. Her entire body shook as she held on to the wall with trembling hands. She didn’t want to go back to her world. She wanted to go back to Alex.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Your Highness, we received the news of ma’am’s safe arrival in Mir city,” Gen reported to the duke in his office. He had assumed that Alexcent would want to be the first to know of her safe arrival.</p>
<p>Alexcent simply replied, “Ok.”</p>
<p>“And also, we assigned a servant who can be trusted to take care of her.”</p>
<p>“You’ve done well,” Alexcent answered, still not looking up from his work.</p>
<p>“According to a report, some random stranger seemed to hit on her.” Gen mentioned. The duke looked up at this, and Gen started to feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“And?” Alexcent prodded, showing a hint of concern at this.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, she used the pistol that she had to get away.”</p>
<p>“Pistol?!” Alexcent laughed. “It’s a good thing we taught her. Increase the security in Mir city.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already made the arrangements as the town festival starts soon,” Gen assured him.</p>
<p>“Town festival? Interesting. Is Pian still in the palace?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Yes. He’s still in the palace somewhere. Why are you looking for a wizard?” Gen had no idea what Alexcent was up to.</p>
<p>“Tell Pian to start preparing a transformation potion.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness! That’s a very dangerous potion. There’s immense pain and with your royal bloodline you will…”</p>
<p>Alexcent cut Gen off abruptly. “Tell him to prepare the potion as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” Gen answered unwillingly. He left the office in search of the wizard.</p>
<p>The magic potion Alexcent had asked for changes a person’s appearance, but comes with immense pain. Especially anyone like the duke who comes from strong, royal bloodlines, where the potion’s side effects are even worse.</p>
<p>Even so, the duke needed the potion. He wanted to see her again, and this festival gave him the opportunity.  The pain of not seeing her was worse than the pain the potion would give to him.</p>
<p>Alexcent stood up from his desk and went to the window. Staring blankly at his reflection, he began to sob quietly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Why is it so busy outside?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“Ma’am, the town festival started today,” her servant answered.</p>
<p>“Ah! I’m assuming this is the festival you spoke of a few days ago.”</p>
<p>“Would you like to join in the festivities?” the servant asked.</p>
<p>“Join? Can I?” Amethyst was intrigued.</p>
<p>“Of course. You just have to wear a mask and you can join in whatever events you wish to in the town square. There are many interesting things to be seen.”</p>
<p>“Why a mask?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“It began with some noble family in the capital. They started wearing masks to hide their identities amongst the commoners and the style ended up becoming a trend for everyone who attends.”</p>
<p>This was a golden opportunity for Amethyst, who had avoided public gatherings since her encounter with the stranger on the beach. She would be able to enjoy the festival, and no one would know who she was. She donned the black mask, handed to her by the maid, and placed it over her face. Liking what she saw in the mirror, she left the castle and headed for the city.</p>
<p>The streets were full of people, all wearing fabulous and exotic masks. Amethyst hadn’t realized so many people lived in the city. Or were they mostly tourists? She followed the sounds of music and excited laughter to the central square of the city. There, she was amazed to find dozens of men and women dancing in the open air. Everywhere she looked, the people had smiles on their faces.</p>
