            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 43 – A Doting Husband (2)</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent repeated the whole process when the towel cooled off, and wrapped her feet in a warm towel. Then he would massage her feet hoping the swelling would die down.</p>
<p>“Ash.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”a</p>
<p>“Just now, what did you mean when you said you are not compatible with people who judge others based on their appearances?” As Alexcent asked nonchalantly, Amethyst tilted her head wondering what he was referring to. “In the afternoon, to the clerk at the boutique.”</p>
<p>“Oh! It’s nothing for you to be bothered about. It was just…a small misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>“A small misunderstanding….”</p>
<p>Alexcent did not easily let her change the subject. When it seemed like she wasn’t going to tell him, he increased the strength in his hand as he massaged her legs.</p>
<p>“Aghh! Alec, that hurts!”</p>
<p>“So, tell me.”</p>
<p>“It’s really nothing. Ahhh, slower! Okay!”</p>
<p>As he resumed massaging her gently, Amethyst told him what happened earlier on as she had no other choice. Alexcent’s face stiffened as he listened to her story silently, but as he was someone who barely showed facial expressions, Amethyst didn’t notice.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was a small matter.”</p>
<p>“It is not small.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“I planned every single detail when it comes to Newhenfield. There isn’t a single place where I have not been involved in making. That’s how perfectly I have planned it to be, so I don’t want to miss out on anything no matter how small.”</p>
<p>Amethyst contemplated the matter for a while before opening her mouth to speak up.</p>
<p>“If that’s what you think, then reeducating the clerk might be good. Because for me, I had the title as your wife and received an apology. But I’m sure there are far more cases where they don’t. Also, you might want to consider the parallel scenario.”</p>
<p>“Parallel?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Where the customer says or behaves rudely, requesting for services beyond their obligation, or causing a situation. Clerks are employees who are paid for their services, they are not slaves. Unlike what happened today, I’m sure there are cases where a customer acts out to the employees. Even I’m not familiar with how to deal with such situations. So, wouldn’t it help if there was a manual of some sort to refer to?”</p>
<p>“I see… I will take note. What else?”</p>
<p>“Mmm…The buildings were grand and just beautiful. The streets were clean and-”</p>
<p><em>Wait, is he doing a service monitoring? Am I a survey target?</em></p>
<p>“Hold on, did you intentionally tell Lunia to guide me to Newhenfield? You did, right? No wonder, I thought it was odd the moment you showed up!”</p>
<p>“Maybe I did.”</p>
<p>“Really, you! You-”</p>
<p>“From now on you can shop in the mansion. You can call on the vendors. Save yourself the trouble.”</p>
<p>“Even though I had no intention to shop in the near future, I will!”</p>
<p>Alexcent inserted his fingers in between Amethyst’s toes and turned her feet slowly. Then he massaged her calf and loosened her tense muscles. His hand then crept up and stayed on her thigh. Her cheeks blushed at the pressure of his grasp.</p>
<p>With a strange change in the atmosphere, his red eyes looked at her with a burning gaze and as their eyes met, he raised his upper body and took his face close to her lips.</p>
<p>His forehead met her forehead…</p>
<p>His nose brushed against her nose…</p>
<p>She felt his hot breath on her face…</p>
<p>Amethyst couldn’t resist the intense gaze and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Alexcent gently placed his lips on top of hers. Soon the kiss grew heated as they suck3d on one another’s lips.</p>
<p>His tongue searched her mouth fiercely, while hers str0ked his. As the situation grew more intense, Amethyst tapped on his shoulder. It was a passionate kiss, and her instinct wanted him but she was too tired today. She cleared her throat lightly as he looked at her.</p>
<p>“Umm Alec…today…”</p>
<p>“I know. You must be tired. You should rest.”</p>
<p>She kissed him on the cheek and reclined back on the bed. Alexcent stroked her hair with his large hand. As she felt the soothing strokes, her eyelids felt heavy and soon she fell into darkness.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The minute Alexcent entered his office, he turned to Gen who had been waiting for his arrival.</p>
<p>“Dismiss the boutique I was at today.”</p>
<p>“What? But they still have a long term left as they just signed the contract—”</p>
<p>As Alexcent shot him a cold look, Gen shut his mouth, silently passing him the contracts that needed his review.</p>
<p>“Yes. Understood.”</p>
<p>“And make sure all the shop owners and employees in Newhenfield are aware of today’s happening.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“And on the other hand, we need to find a way to set a protocol to deal with rampant customers, so make a manual and make sure they’re educated.”</p>
<p>Gen looked at him in utter confusion as to what was going on but said nothing.</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>“If there are any key nobles that need exclusive treatment, create a list and manage them separately. Tourism may be important, but I’m not running a charity. It’s a necessity to give the nobles exclusive treatment since they secure our profits. But don’t make it obvious.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir.” He collected the files that had been signed. “Your Highness, the high priest Celios has requested for funds again.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
