            <p><strong>Chapter 129</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent woke up very early. It was his normal routine. He was an early person. At first, he felt confused and wondered where he was. It had been a while since he found someone nestled in his arms, sleeping peacefully. Amethyst.</p>
<p>She looked so vulnerable. He pulled up the covers over her and stroked her scattered hair. He combed through them gently with his fingers, trying to untangle them. A strand caught between his fingers and Amethyst stirred. “Mm… hurts,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he whispered against her ear. She didn’t respond. She must have fallen sleep again. He tucked her in the covers as best as he could and got out of the bed, leaving her to sleep.</p>
<p>“Mm… don’t go,” mumbled Amethyst, perhaps sensing the disappearing warmth.</p>
<p>Alexcent sat back on the edge of the bed. She was talking in her sleep. “Shh, go back to sleep,” he said, stroking her cheek. “I will see you later.” He kissed her on her cheek and picked up the gown. The scratch marks on his back disappeared underneath the gown.</p>
<p>After a while, Amethyst opened her eyes, drowsy from sleep. He was already gone. She wondered if everything had been a dream. She extended her hand out to feel the space beside her. She felt relieved to sense the last lingering remains of his warmth. She smiled to herself.</p>
<p>She pulled his pillow close and hugged it to her. It smelled like him. She breathed in his scent. She then sat up on her bed. “Ro…,” she tried to call. Her throat was sore. <em>Well, I suppose that is expected after how much screaming we did last night. </em>She blushed.</p>
<p>She cleared her throat and tried again. “Roman?”</p>
<p>The door opened and Roman entered. “Yes, Madam,” she said.</p>
<p>“Where is Lunia?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“She has been waiting for you to wake up, Madam,” said Roman.</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Amethyst, “Could you tell her that she can come in.”</p>
<p>She didn’t get out of the bed. She found that she had no energy left to do that. She was completely exhausted despite having slept a while.</p>
<p>“Madam,” said Lunia, as she entered. “How have you been feeling?” Lunia smiled.</p>
<p>Despite the warm smile, Lunia seemed tired. Her dark circles seemed deeper than usual. <em>She must have had a hard trip with the other ladies, </em>thought Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Lunia!” she cried happily, “How was the trip to Newhenfield? Did everything go alright?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it was great!” said Lunia, “The trip was great, all thanks to you, Madam.” Lunia paused and then smirked. “I heard you had an amazing time as well… yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?!” exclaimed Amethyst, unable to stop herself blushing.</p>
<p>“Well, everybody knows you two had a great time,” said Lunia, “The whole mansion heard it, I think.”</p>
<p>If Amethyst could have blushed even more, or could feel any more embarrassed, she would have. Lunia smiled brightly at her. Her smile made Amethyst feel relieved. “I am hoping that it will put her in her place. You did good.” said Lunia. Amethyst didn’t need to ask who she meant.</p>
<p>“The problem is that she is not the kind of person who will be affected so much by such things, though,” said Amethyst. “She is very hard-headed.”</p>
<p>“That’s true,” said Lunia, “Which brings me to the thing I wanted to talk to you about. You have to be prepared for the upcoming ball.”</p>
<p>“Ball?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Lunia, “You need to make things clear once and for all. Set it in the stone, so to speak.” Amethyst smiled awkwardly at her exaggeration.</p>
<p>“Oh. Madam,” said Lunia, “Did you get the duke’s approval for your participation in the hunting match?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I will get it soon,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p><em>I completely forgot about that, </em>thought Amethyst.<em> I forgot everything because of everything to do with Count Glacia. I will ask Alexcent later. </em>She was annoyed that she had to seek permission. Couldn’t she have the freedom to decide on what she wanted to do?</p>
<p>“I heard that you resolved a big issue of national importance,” said Lunia, beaming at her, “The conference might end sooner than expected. So, the next agenda is to prepare for the ball. But before that, since you were interested to take part in the hunting match, you need to be invited specifically by the duke.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Amethyst, “Don’t worry about that.”</p>
<p><em>If it’s the same Alec from last night, I’m sure he will allow it. </em>Amethyst was very confident that it wouldn’t pose a problem at all.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After Alexcent headed to his own room and took a bath, he changed into his uniform and walked to the conference hall. Gen, who had been waiting for him to wake up, walked with him.</p>
<p>“Congratulations,” said Gen.</p>
<p>“What for?” asked Alexcent, turning to Gen while they walked.</p>
<p>“For the battle scars,” said Gen, pointing to the bite mark visible on Alexcent’s neck, along with the scratches. The marks were visible above the collar and Gen continued teasing him despite it.</p>
<p>“You never sustained a single wound even in the war,” he said jokingly.</p>
<p>“Ahh,” said Alexcent, “What can I do? This opponent was too strong. I lost this battle, but I quite like these scars.”</p>
