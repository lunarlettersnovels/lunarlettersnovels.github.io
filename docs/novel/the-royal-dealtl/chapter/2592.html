            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 80</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent did not hesitate in buying the necklace that held the jewel ‘Eye of the Goddess’. Dunph was surprised, shocked even, because Alexcent hadn’t even asked for the price before he decided to buy it.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?” asked Alexcent, noticing the dumbfounded expression of Dunph.</p>
<p>“No, sire,” he stammered, “Nothing at all.”</p>
<p>“Bring this in, when you come,” said Alexcent indicating the necklace.</p>
<p>“Understood, sire,” he said.</p>
<p>Dunph had never, in his wildest dreams, thought that the Eye of the Goddess would be sold. He had thought it impossible because none had the wealth enough to buy it.</p>
<p>“Leave now,” said Alexcent, dismissing the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>“Yes, sire,” he said bowing, “It has been a pleasure to serve you. Thank you for honoring our shop.”</p>
<p>“Wrap all the best things in your shop and bring it to wherever Pon will guide you,” instructed Alexcent as Dunph was leaving.</p>
<p>“All… all of them?” asked Dunph, stunned.</p>
<p>“Is there a problem with it?” asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>“No problem at all, sire!” said Dunph hurriedly, “I will do as commanded.”</p>
<p>Dunph was led by Pon to a reception room, while servants placed the jewel boxes on the table in the middle. He felt extremely blissful at having sold all his best and most precious jewels in a day!</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Is this for me?” asked Amethyst, holding the beautiful necklace in her hands like something delicate and fraglile.</p>
<p>“Of course, my lady” said Dunph, “This particular jewel called the ‘Eye of the Goddess’ hadn’t found its owner yet. I am honored to have met you today.” Amethyst thought the name was most apt. The red jewel reminded her of Alexcent’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I have had the rest placed in your reception room,” he said.</p>
<p>“The rest?!” asked Amethyst incredulously. She had wanted to shop for only a small accessory.</p>
<p>“The good sir bought all of my best jewels,” he said.</p>
<p>“All of them?” asked Amethyst, stunned.</p>
<p>Dunph nodded. Amethyst wondered how much it had cost Alexcent.</p>
<p>“It is my honor to have met you today,” said Dunph, bowing, “I will leave you with your jewels.” Dunph said and left her gazing at the necklace.</p>
<p>“Do you want to try it on, my lady?” asked Lunia.</p>
<p>“Later,” she said and placed the necklace in the box. “I want to finish shopping first.”</p>
<p>Amethyst thought all of it was too much. She had been hoping for a small, nice accessory not the jewels of the earth that she couldn’t carry. She needed a change of venue.</p>
<p>“Where do you want to go next?” asked Lunia.</p>
<p>“The weapon shop,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Why the weapon shop, my lady?” asked Lunia, surprised.</p>
<p>“I thought I could learn how to protect myself after what happened with Dajal,” said Amethyst, “And for that I need to learn to fight. I need a weapon to do so. I have already asked Pon to show me one.”</p>
<p>Amethyst could not tell Lunia the whole truth. She wouldn’t be Alexcent’s wife after a year and would have no knights stationed to guard and protect her. She would have to do so herself. “Oh, I will call the merchant, ma’am,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>He entered at Lunia’s call. “Thank you for having me, Ma’am,” said the man, “I am Jerome, from Zest Weapon Shop.” The man looked more like a knight than merchant. Even with the monocle on his eyes, he looked like he belonged in a fight than a shop. “How may I be of help?”</p>
<p>“I want to buy a sword that I can wield and a gun that I can possess,” said Amethyst. Jerome looked surprised.</p>
<p>“Is there a problem Jerome?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“No, Ma’am,” he said, “Just a little rare. I have only ever sold weapons to women who mostly want to buy them as gifts for their husbands. Forgive me for saying so.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said, “I need to have them so that I can defend myself.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I don’t have suitable weapons right now at my disposal made for your build,” said Jerome, “Would it be alright if you checked the items that you want so that I can have it customized for you?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” said Amethyst, “I didn’t know you provided that.”</p>
<p>“There are, even if rare, some ladies who approach my shop to buy a weapon for themselves,” said Jerome, “I have them customized to suit their build.”</p>
<p>“That is indeed great,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“I will show you the swords first,” said Jerome and led her to the display. Lunia followed her a step behind.</p>
<p>“Perhaps, this…,” said Jerome, as he lifted out a sword and handed it to her.</p>
<p>Amethyst lifted the sword. It was a bit longer than she had expected and a bit heavy but she could lift it well.</p>
<p>“How is it?” asked Jerome.</p>
<p>“It is a bit heavy, but alright,” she said.</p>
<p>“I thought it might work,” said Jerome, “This sword is used by the beginners in fighting.”</p>
<p>“I think I can swing it,” said Amethyst, excitedly. But Jerome stalled her hand.</p>
<p>“Be careful, Ma’am,” he said, “You might hurt your wrist the first time.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“I think we may have to reduce the weight a little to make it lighter to wield,” he said.</p>
<p>“But wouldn’t that make it less effective for a fight?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Sword fighting is more about agility and skill than the weight of it, Ma’am,” said Jerome, “But if you feel hesitant, it won’t pose a problem if it is imbued with magic.”</p>
<p>“That can be done?” she asked, curious.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said Jerome, “We use powdered magic stones and mix it with the steel.”</p>
<p>“That is fascinating!” said Amethyst.</p>
