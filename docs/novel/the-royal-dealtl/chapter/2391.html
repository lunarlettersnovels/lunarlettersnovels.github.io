            <p><strong>Chapter 277</strong></p>
<p>Belice was born with only half power. Unlike Empress Caniel, and all of the previous empresses, Belice didn’t receive the entirety of the Goddess’ blood. Caniel had been afraid that Belice would be looked down upon, and worried that Belice’s position wouldn’t solidify after she became the empress. Caniel tried her best to protect Belice and to make her throne safe to ascend to. Those who dared to question the princess’ ability would be charged with treason and executed.</p>
<p>The power of this decree was amazing. Caniel didn’t let anyone, who looked down on the princess, slide. She never forgave even the smallest mistakes, and this applied to people of all statuses. From the lowest maids who served the princess to the noble families, all were monitored. Whoever didn’t serve the princess in their entirety, or treated her wrong, or were impolite to her; all were all executed. She didn’t allow any rumours or heresy to exist. This was the only way for the empress to protect the princess. It was an unmerciful bloodbath.</p>
<p>After Belice got older, there were people who trembled just by being in her presence. She became a figure of terror, and that fear kept everyone in line. The need for executions began to diminish</p>
<p>Caniel called in her attendee, Harin. “The princess’ palace is in chaos for some reason,” she informed him.</p>
<p>Even though the princess’ palace was right beside the empress’, there was still quite a distance between them. To be able to sense even that smallest amount of chaos seemed to indicate that Caniel had the greatest amount of power in the empire, making her the complete empress.</p>
<p>“Apparently they are busy preparing for a teatime to be hosted by the princess, Your Majesty,” Harin reported.</p>
<p>“Is that today?” Caniel asked.</p>
<p>“Yes. It appears the princess is taking a lot of responsibility, considering it’s the first one she is hosting.” It was the first teatime to be hosted by the princess, after turning fifteen, so it was understandable that it had gotten a little rowdy.</p>
<p>Caniel handed over some signed documents to Harin and said “Adjust my schedule today. I would like to visit the princess once teatime starts.” Caniel figured this would be a great way to raise the princess’ appearance. She wouldn’t be able to make it to all of them, but considering this was Belice’s first, she felt it was necessary to be there.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” Harin understood her intentions and instantly left to adjust the royal’s schedule.</p>
<p>In the palace next door, Belice couldn’t calm down from the excitement, butterflies, and worry about the first teatime she was hosting. She was struggling with all of the details.</p>
<p>“The weather? It’s not going to rain, right?” She said, even as she looked at the sunlight streaming through the window.</p>
<p>“Of course not. It’s a perfect day for teatime,” Karune, her servant, answered.</p>
<p>“Do you think they’re done prepping the tables?”</p>
<p>“Yes, princess.”</p>
<p>“According to my specifications?”</p>
<p>“Of course, princess.”</p>
<p>“Good. Did you check the attendee’s confirmation?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Everyone you invited said they’ll be attending.” Karune was trying hard not to laugh at Belice’s anxiety. They had gone through all of this already. “Princess, you must change into your dress first.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Right.” Belice knew she had been forgetting something.</p>
<p>“Nothing too fancy,” Karune instructed.</p>
<p>“Yes. Understood.” Belice had already chosen her dress, and it was pretty fancy. She couldn’t let her guests down, who were expecting regality.</p>
<p>“If that is all, then I will return shortly.”</p>
<p>“That is, Karune. Good job and thank you.”</p>
<p>Karune bowed and left. The remaining servants took down the dress that Belice pointed out to them. Lifting her arms into the air, the servants began helping her change.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Briden! What are you doing? Why are you not ready?” Count Julia shouted through the closed door.</p>
<p>“I’m not going!” The voice called from inside.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? You accepted the princess’ invitation and now you’re not going? Where is your loyalty?”</p>
<p>Even though he was scolding his daughter, Count Julia knew exactly what her issue was. The discussion of marriage with Marquis Meblen’s son, who Briden was smitten with, was turned down. All because the young princess, Belice, had just turned fifteen.</p>
<p>The princess had become a lady, and instantly she was the topic of discussion amongst the noble families. She would bring power, fame, and riches to the family she marries into. If one could become the husband of the princess, who would one day become the empress, their house would become the most powerful in the entire Empire.</p>
<p>So, amongst the nobles, who had similarly aged sons, there was a stop in marriage discussions in hope they would be chosen for the princess. This included Count Julia, and he hadn’t realized the impact it would have on his daughter.</p>
<p>However, Count Julia saw this as an opportunity. Marquis Meblen’s son would never be chosen by the princess. Their family was too low for her. But Count Julia knew that if Briden and the princess became close, it would raise the honour of his house and then Marquis Mable would be begging for his son to marry Briden.</p>
<p>Briden wouldn’t hear any of this logic right now. She couldn’t see the big picture. So, he had to hide his true intentions and somehow console Briden enough to send her into the palace.</p>
<p>“Briden! Do I have to drag you out!” Count Julia shouted. The door slowly opened and Briden stood sulking at the entry. “Think about your family,” he said to her gently.</p>
<p>“You’re so overbearing!” Briden said.</p>
<p>“Briden!”</p>
<p>“Fine! I’ll go! I’ll go.” She was mad that she had to attend, but she knew that if she didn’t it would bring trouble to the family. She would need to have an unbreakable reason not to go. Sighing, she closed the door on her father and began getting ready to head to the palace.</p>
