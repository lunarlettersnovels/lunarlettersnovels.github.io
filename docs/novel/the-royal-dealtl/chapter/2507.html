            <p><strong>Chapter 161</strong></p>
<p>Alexcent was back into is gloomy mood these few days. He was in a very, very bad mood. A few days ago, Amethyst had told him she hated him in an outburst and started to avoid him. Whenever he tried to make some conversation or ask for her advice, she would always say:</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t know since I’m not <em>that lady</em>.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure some other accomplished lady would be better suited to give you suggestions.”</p>
<p>She always mentioned ‘that lady’ in whatever she said. A few days ago, when returning to the mansion from the palace, he had seen a beautiful flower shop. He had stopped the carriage and gone in. The shop had so many varieties of flowers.</p>
<p>He remembered what she had said when he gifted her an earring. “I’ll be happier if you give me a present you choose on your own next time.</p>
<p>He was unable to fathom why Amethyst was in such a bad mood. But she liked flowers. So, he would do his best. As Gen opened the door to the flower shop, the overhead bell rang, and the owner of the shop rushed to the front to greet Gen and Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Welcome!” said the owner of the shop.</p>
<p>Alexcent was looking at the flowers inside the shop. “Give me this, this and this,” he said indicating three different flowers.</p>
<p>“Ah, may I ask how you would like it to be prepared? A flower basket or a bouquet…,” the flower shop owner was gathering the flowers Alexcent had pointed at.</p>
<p>“Make it a bouquet,” said Alexcent briskly.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said the owner, “I will have it prepared as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Wait, this is nice too. Add this and that,” said Alexcent indicating different flowers.</p>
<p>“The bouquet might appear very big with so many flowers, is that alright?” asked the owner.</p>
<p>Alexcent nodded. “The bigger the better. Add that red flower and the blue ones, too. Ah, the yellow ones as well.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Alexcent had no interest in flowers and had never learnt their names. So he pointed at the ones that looked pretty to him. The owner tried to keep his pace with picking the floers as directed by Alexcent. He was getting greyer by the second.</p>
<p>“And lastly, baby’s breath,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>He didn’t forget to add her favorite flower.</p>
<p>“Of course,” said the owner, “By the way, My Lord, this is meant to be a bouquet, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, why? Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. Please wait a minute. I will prepare it for you. Excuse me one moment.”</p>
<p>The owner cowered away at Alexcent’s fierce gaze and started to pack the flowers. He seemed to be trying his hardest to make the mismatch of flowers aesthetically pleasing as possible. Soon, a bouquet was prepared. It was very large and heavy.</p>
<p>Alexcent looked satisfied. He gestured to Gen to pay the owner and get the bouquet. Gen was standing there in a daze.</p>
<p><em>Should I think highly of the owner for making such an odd-looking bouquet without asking questions under the duke’s gaze, or should I judge him for not holding his ground as a professional of this field and advising the duke against such an outrageous bouquet? </em>Gen thought and sighed. He paid the owner but couldn’t help feeling that the Prince’s taste was lacking in terms of flowers. Of course, he didn’t say it out loud.</p>
<p>Alexcent boarded the carriage and sat carefully near the bouquet so as to not spoil it. The carriage finally started towards the mansion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Alexcent presented her with the bouquet, Amethyst received it with much difficulty. It was large and exotic but looked so mismatched. It had so many brightly colored flowers that looking at the bouquet directly made anyone dizzy.</p>
<p>“Alec…did you pick them yourself?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p><em>Obviously, </em>thought Amethyst,<em> I doubt any florist would willing make a bouquet like this.</em></p>
<p>“Of course.,” he declared proudly, “I picked them all myself.” He looked at her cautiously. “Do you like it?”</p>
<p>Amethyst felt happy and touched but she didn’t quite know what to say to that. It was adorable to see that someone who was deemed perfect had his flaws as well, but still made an effort to do something like this.</p>
<p>She studied each flower. Suddenly, an image of Lady Roelter flashed through her mind. The large exotic flower reminded her of the lady. All fancy and exotic.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if he had given her flowers, </em>thought Amethyst. <em>I am sure he didn’t give her a monstrous bouquet like this. Maybe he gave her a nicely done bouquet to please her. </em>She sighed. She wondered why all her thoughts ended in jealous towards Lady Roelter. She didn’t want to torture herself and Alec like this. But thinking about him making efforts to woo another lady made her hate him to no end.</p>
<p>She hated herself, too for being unable to appreciate and accept him. “Thank you. But I’m sure some other lady would have liked it better.”</p>
<p>Her reply was disheartening to Alexcent. It made him fear engaging her in conversation altogether. Since the duke was in a very bad mood, all the staff walked on thin ice. They feared that he was returning to being the old grumpy version of himself.</p>
