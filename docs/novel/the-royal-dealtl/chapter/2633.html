            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 40 – Waste of Time (1)</strong></p>
<p>The clerk ignored Amethyst’s statement and addressed the lady with the fake smile painted on her face. “Lady Keaton, would you like to look around for a while? We have some new dresses that are very beautiful as well. In the meantime, I will prepare the dress for you.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>The young Lady Keaton looked Amethyst up and down before smirking and walking away. After waiting for her to walk away, the clerk turned around to face Amethyst. “Like I said earlier dear, this is a dress that you cannot afford. Why don’t you give it to the lady instead? There are a lot of dresses on sale on the other side.”</p>
<p>Even though her words were poisonous, the smile never left her face. Amethyst decided to buy the pink dress no matter what, just to prove this clerk wrong.</p>
<p>“I will decide whether I buy it or not. And since I chose this dress first, I will try it first.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear, I wasn’t going to say this, but do you really think with your plain looks you can handle a magnificent dress like this?”</p>
<p>“What…did you just say?!” Lunia gasped infuriatedly.</p>
<p>Just then another employee approached the clerk and whispered something in her ear. The clerk nodded and side-eyed them before walking away with the other employee.</p>
<p>“Tsk! What kind of person is she?” Amethyst bit out.</p>
<p>“Ma’am, please reveal your identity. There is a dire need to reprimand such a person.”</p>
<p>“No, never! There is no need to go to that extent for someone like that. They are not worthy.”</p>
<p>Amethyst’s mood was completely spoiled, and she had half a mind to just let go of the dress and leave this place.</p>
<p>“Really, if you weren’t so pretty, I would never have stepped into this place,” She muttered to the dress.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she noticed that the direction in which the clerk had gone, there was complete silence. She peeked around the corner and saw that every single person in the shop only had eyes for one sight; the man who had just entered. He brushed his silky platinum hair back from his face and his glistening red eyes. His broad frame seemed to fill up the entire boutique with his presence. She was surprised by his sudden appearance and she wasn’t the only one.</p>
<p>The clerk was well aware of who the man was, and she stumbled in her haste to step forward.</p>
<p>“My goodness! Your Highness please may I welcome you to our humble boutique! It is a great honour. I am Madam Brita, the manager of the store. It would be an honour to serve you—”</p>
<p>Much to her pleasure, Alexcent’s eyes searched the shop while the clerk spoke with annoyance etched onto his face. As he looked around, the ladies who mistakenly thought that they had caught his eye, blushed and giggled. When they both finally locked eyes, he walked straight towards her; the woman who had caught his eye, cutting off the clerk without an excuse.</p>
<p>Lunia sensed someone’s presence behind her, she took her eyes away from Amethyst to look around. As she saw Alexcent, she bowed and moved aside.</p>
<p>Alexcent wrapped his arms around Amethyst’s waist and kissed her briefly on the lips. Amethyst was taken aback by his affection. She hadn’t expected him to behave this way in public.</p>
<p>“Are you done with your shopping?”</p>
<p><em>‘Wasn’t this the same person who tried to get himself out of going shopping together just this morning?’</em></p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“I was in the area when I saw your carriage. Are you still far from done?” Alexcent looked around her impatiently.</p>
<p>Lunia glanced at the clerk who had served them earlier. As she saw the clerk unable to close her mouth and staring at the two in shock, Lunia couldn’t help but feel a sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>“You’re just in time, Alec. Out of these two dresses which one do you think is prettier?”</p>
<p>Amethyst looked up at him with large sparkling eyes and took turns in bringing the dresses near her frame, asking him to choose one. Alec realized he was reliving the horrors of the other day and quickly called the clerk over, who finally seemed to come to her senses as she approached them rigidly.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness?”</p>
<p>“Pack everything from here to there,” he waved his hand but then thought of something else. “Better yet, just pack everything here and send it to the palace. Including the ones that my wife is holding.”</p>
<p>The madam looked ready to faint.</p>
<p>“Alec?!” As Amethyst spoke in a surprised tone, Alexcent coolly met her gaze and continued.</p>
<p>“What are you contemplating about? If you like them, just buy them all. What a waste of time to choose between two.”</p>
<p>“You…you—”</p>
<p>“Yes?” He rose an eyebrow, challenging her to speak something against him in public. But she was only impressed by him.</p>
<p>“Nothing, you’re awesome.”</p>
<p>Alexcent was as awesome as the main character in her favourite novel. She showed him a thumbs up and smiled widely.</p>
<p>The clerk seemed deep in shock, as the person she had just looked down on was the wife of the prince. Then shocked again by the fact that the famous prince of blood had just bought the entire shop for his wife. She couldn’t fathom which she found more surprising. Probably both.</p>
<p>“Are you still not done yet?” Alexcent asked in an agitated voice.</p>
<p>The clerk finally came to her senses and started to move hurriedly. Even though she was busy packing, she found the time to discreetly approach Amethyst and whisper to her.</p>
<p>“My Lady, I am so sorry for my rudeness and not having recognized you earlier on. Please don’t hold it against me.”</p>
