            <p><strong>Chapter 269</strong></p>
<p>Before Amethyst could continue, Alexcent ran to her and wrapped her in a massive embrace, his lips pressing against hers with a hunger and intense passion before pulling back.</p>
<p>“A deal? I don’t care what it is, as long as you’re beside me.” He embraced her once more, whispering “My one and only.”</p>
<p>“I love you, Alec.” Amethyst said, breathlessly between kisses. “And I’m sorry. I’m not too late right?”</p>
<p>“Too late? Never.” He said before placing his lips on hers once more.</p>
<p>Amethyst let out a small moan of contentment. She had so much to ask him but, for now, she just wanted to experience his love. Unnoticed by the embracing couple, Pon quietly closed the door from the outside.</p>
<p>“Alec! Wait!” Amethyst was barely able to get out the words as he continued to kiss her. His passion seemed unquenchable, and Amethyst quickly spoke before things gets heated up. “Alec, how would you feel if I was older than you? Would you care?”</p>
<p>“Age? What about it? That is the least of my concerns.” His eyes lowered to her bosom, and he began undoing the ribbons of her dress.</p>
<p>“Alec,” Amethyst continued with concern. “Are you all right if I’m not actually Amethyst? Even if this appearance that you see isn’t who you think it is, would you still be able to love me the way I am?”</p>
<p>“Ash. What I love isn’t just your appearance. It’s what’s inside. I told you before, but your face doesn’t suit me.” Alexcent smirked to show he was teasing her.</p>
<p>“Alec!” She laughed and smacked him on the shoulder. As he seemed to not care about any of her worries, everything that was bothering her seemed meaningless.</p>
<p>“Alec…” She began, interrupting the kissing once more.</p>
<p>“What is it this time? It doesn’t matter if you’re younger than me or older, if you’re Amethyst or not, if you’re from another world and not from here, even if you’re a monster and not human. I don’t care. You, the person standing in front of me, is the most important thing I care about. I just need you, the woman I love.”</p>
<p>Amethyst seemed satisfied so she grabbed him by his collar and pulled him towards her. She kissed him even more passionately than he had. Alexcent smiled and lifted her petite body into his arms.</p>
<p>Alexcent carried Amethyst from the office to her old chambers on the second floor. Even, with her absence, Pon had made sure to keep her room clean and tidy every day. It was as if she had never left. Alexcent carefully laid her on the bed. Just like their first night, he straddled her body and stared down into her eyes. He brushed the side of her face with his palm, gently pushing back a strand of hair.</p>
<p>“Alec. You don’t know how much I’ve dreamed of this. I remembered this feeling every time I closed my eyes. And life felt empty whenever I woke up from the dream. I’m afraid that this might be a dream right now.”</p>
<p>His hands trembled. “I was the same. I thought I might go insane, I wanted you so much.”</p>
<p>She lifted her arms up and wrapped them around his neck. He had longed for her, just as she had longed for him. Amethyst put her mouth against his neck and bit him on the rough skin. Alexcent flinched slightly.</p>
<p>“It hurts, right?” Amethyst asked. Alexcent nodded. “Where I’m from if it hurts it’s not a dream. So, this is not a dream right now.”</p>
<p>“You bit me.” Alexcent said, in shock.</p>
<p>“And you loved it.” Amethyst said, smiling. Then she took him once more in her embrace.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They had not slept a moment that night. Alexcent opened Amethyst’s legs and bit the inside of her thigh. There were already teeth mark in several places, but he didn’t care. The pain had quickly turned into pleasure.</p>
<p>Amethyst had climaxed numerous times, but Alexcent still didn’t seem to be satisfied. “I can’t,” she croaked, her voice hoarse from the moans of passion.</p>
<p>“No way. I’m going to get everything I have missed up to now.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Amethyst asked with exhaustion. Alexcent picked her up and turned her around. Amethyst, knowing well what that position meant, complained, “I can’t do it in that position anymore. I can hardly stay upright any longer.”</p>
<p>Alexcent made her lie down sideways instead. He lifted one of her thighs and kissed the skin of her leg. She moaned as he began to caress her s*x with his thumb, quickly making her wet once more. Amethyst twisted her body to look at him. She could tell that he wanted to go once more. She nodded and he spread her legs wider, penetrating her deeply. Alexcent’s eyes rolled back into his head as he moved in and out of the incredible warmth. Though he had come a number of times, each moment felt new and exhilarating.</p>
<p>Amethyst’s breathing got heavier at Alexcent’s rhythmic pounding. The exhausting pleasure of 0rgasm shook her body once more, but still he worked her passion. His large hand was on her breast, with her n!pple between his thumb and index finger. He would alternate between squeezing hard and caressing softly. Once and a while, he would twist her buds so hard that she would scream in ecstasy.</p>
<p>She slapped at his forearms, wanting him to both stop and go harder. She felt an unbelievable thrill from his aggressiveness. She pulled herself off of him, forced him on to his back and straddled his chest. Now Amethyst was looking down at Alexcent. His blonde hair was wet with sweat.</p>
<p>Her kiss trailed from his forehead, the tip of his nose, and to his lips. She didn’t stop there, continuing to his Adam’s apple, his collarbone, his chest. Her lips brushed his strong abs and then she went further down. Now it was Alexcent’s turn to groan.</p>
<p>Amethyst smiled at him and took him into her mouth. The touch of her hands, the moisture of her mouth, and the heat of her breath brought him to the edge. “Please,” he groaned.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Amethyst said, releasing him from her lips.</p>
<p>Alexcent almost lost his sanity, being brought to the brink and then denied satisfaction. He grabbed her by the arms, hoisting her on top of him and entering her with his throbbing shaft. His groans grew louder and louder as she thrust her hips up and down, as if this would be their last moment to ever be together. With a final wail, they cried out together as his seed erupted within her.</p>
