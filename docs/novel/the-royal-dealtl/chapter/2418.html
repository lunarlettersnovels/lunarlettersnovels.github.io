            <p><strong>Chapter 250</strong></p>
<p>When Amethyst came down from changing, Alexcent was standing in front of the carriage that she used for deliveries. He held out his hand, to assist Amethyst up into the driving seat, then went around to the other side and hoisted himself up.</p>
<p>Taking the reigns in hand, he asked “Where should we go?”</p>
<p>“Downtown. We’ re going shopping today,” Amethyst informed him.</p>
<p>Alexcent tensed up at that information. “I just remembered; I have something urgent to take care of. I’ll call you a public carriage.”</p>
<p>“Gray.” Amethyst was used to Gray’s aversion to shopping.</p>
<p>“Yes?” He answered sheepishly</p>
<p>“Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Without another word, Alexcent began driving the carriage to the shopping district.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The place Amethyst directed them to was a tailor shop that catered to men only. It wasn’t high-end clothing, but all the outfits were made-to-fit and of the latest styles.</p>
<p>“Welcome,” the tailor greeted them with a smile as the entered. “What can I help you with?”</p>
<p>“I am looking to buy some clothes for my friend here,” Amethyst said. “I’m thinking something that looks like a suit, but is comfortable enough to work in. Something clean but stylish.”</p>
<p>“You have keen eyes. That is certainly the trend, nowadays. Please wait for a moment. I’ll bring out a few samples. In the meantime, why don’t you look around.” The tailor disappeared into the back room and Amethyst started browsing the displays.</p>
<p>Alexcent whispered to Amethyst, so the tailor wouldn’t overhear him. “Master, I don’t need clothes.”</p>
<p>Amethyst huffed in frustration. “I told you not to call me that! This is an investment!”</p>
<p>“Investment?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If you hadn’t noticed, there have been more customers at the café since you arrived. Why do you think that is?”</p>
<p>“That’s because mast… no, Carol’s cooking is great?”</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed. “I appreciate the compliment, but no. They come to see you.”</p>
<p>“Me?” Alexcent looked genuinely shocked.</p>
<p>“Yes! So, what should we do? Even though the reason is pure vanity, it has increased my sales. I need to invest in that.” Amethyst smiled brightly, which made Alexcent nervous at what she intended.</p>
<p>“Sorry for the wait.” The tailor appeared from the stock room with an armful of clothing.</p>
<p>“Can he try them on? I need to see how they look on him,” Amethyst asked the tailor.</p>
<p>“Of course. The fitting room is right behind you.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. Really!” Alexcent protested.</p>
<p>Amethyst ignored his pleas. “You heard him, right? Go!”</p>
<p>“Carol…”</p>
<p>Amethyst sat down on a sofa and crossed her arms with defiance. “I’ll wait here.”</p>
<p>Alexcent’s deep sigh filled the store, but both Amethyst and the tailor just stared at him in expectation. With a huff of frustration, Alexcent picked up all of the clothes and entered the changing area.</p>
<p>As Amethyst waited for him to change and come out the tailor handed her a catalogue. “Would you like to look at this?” he asked. “If you place an order, we can deliver the items to you.”</p>
<p>“That’s wonderful. Thank you.” Before Amethyst even had a chance to peruse the catalogue, Alexcent stepped out of the changing area in the first set of clothes.</p>
<p>Amethyst frowned at the shirt. “I don’t like the ruffles. Next!”</p>
<p>Alexcent slumped his shoulders and went back in to change into the next outfit. The second set didn’t have ruffles, but they did have ribbons on the sleeves. He couldn’t wear that. The ribbons would dangle in the drinks as he served them.</p>
<p>“Next!” Amethyst announced.</p>
<p>Alexcent dropped his head this time. He continued changing and every outfit he displayed got a cry of ‘Next!’ from the single-person audience. It wasn’t until the thirteenth outfit that Amethyst split a grin on her tired face.</p>
<p>“I like that! We’ll go with that for now!” she cried happily.</p>
<p>“Wonderful,” the tailor said, also clearly getting sleepy from waiting. He measured Alexcent’s sizes and went into the stock room to get the proper fits. “Will that be everything?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Not quite,” Amethyst replied.</p>
<p>“What?” Alexcent asked in surprise, his eyes widening.</p>
<p>“That’s only one outfit. You still have plenty more to try on, right?” Amethyst smiled cruelly.</p>
<p>“Of course! He hasn’t tried on even half of them,” the tailor realized what was going on and decided to help with the game.</p>
<p>Alexcent’s body was like a model. Each time he came out, wearing something new, the fit accentuated a different aspect of his body. Amethyst was really enjoying the show and actually agreed on several more outfits to add to the order. Amethyst was ecstatic about their trip and couldn’t stop smiling as she placed the bags of clothing in the back of the carriage.</p>
<p>“Then shall we head home?” Alexcent asked.</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Amethyst answered.</p>
<p>“Really? Didn’t we buy enough clothes?” Alexcent asked with a moan.</p>
<p>“Yes, but we need something else. Maybe the most important thing. Dress shoes.”</p>
<p>“I really don’t need dress shoes.” Alexcent was at the point of whining like a school boy.</p>
<p>“Nonsense. Don’t you know that dress shoes complete the fashion?”</p>
<p>“I don’t!”</p>
<p>Amethyst smirked at his temper tantrum. “Let’s go,” she said, then dragged him into the shoe store.</p>
