            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 41 – Waste of Time (2)</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst didn’t say anything and simply smiled, letting the clerk stew in uncertainty. She just watched as she quickly moved onto the dresses and moved around busily, packing the dresses into boxes. The number of boxes piling up increased, and just as the packing was nearly done, Amethyst hooked her arms around Alec and spoke.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, I don’t think I will be needing them all Alec. I just want to purchase the two that I was torn between.”</p>
<p>“Why? Is it not the more dresses, the better with you ladies?”</p>
<p>“I doubt I can carry these magnificent dresses with my plain looks.”</p>
<p>“What did you just say? Who dared to say such a thing to you?”</p>
<p><em>‘Unbelievable! He must have forgotten that he too had said something like that to me before.’</em></p>
<p>Alexcent’s low voice sounded life-threatening and it seemed highly possible that if Amethyst were to point out who it was, that person would be beheaded on the spot. Madam Brita who had been busily packing, came to a stop, and the sound of her gulping could be heard across the room.</p>
<p>“Who would say such a thing to me. I’m just thinking out loud.” Amethyst withdrew her gaze from Alec and approached Madam Brita, who looked ready to blow over by the slightest gust of wind.</p>
<p>“I will only purchase the yellow and pastel pink dress I was looking at earlier.”</p>
<p>The poor clerk could only nod.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry that you went through all the trouble to wrap them up. But I just changed my mind.”</p>
<p>“Not a problem at all, my lady! Please don’t concern yourself. Not a problem!”</p>
<p>“Oh, is that so? What a kind heart.”</p>
<p>“Th-thank you! Please come again. I will personally serve you the best then.”</p>
<p>“Well, I doubt there will be a next time. I find I’m not compatible with people who judge others based on their appearance.”</p>
<p>“That…my lady please forgive me.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me please.”</p>
<p>Leaving the miserable looking Madam Brita behind, Amethyst took Alexcent’s arm and left the boutique.</p>
<p><em>Why would I raise the sales of a shop owned by someone like her? Hmph.</em></p>
<p>Thanks to Alexcent’s unexpected appearance she felt much better with her small revenge. She couldn’t help but feel touched by Alec who had fulfilled her dream of buying ‘everything from here to there.’</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>As they left the boutique, Alexcent led a beaming Amethyst towards the carriage.</p>
<p>“Alec.”</p>
<p>Alexcent felt nervous when she called out his name in a gentle voice, which was ridiculous. He was a prince! He didn’t get nervous.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I’m not done.”</p>
<p>“With what?”</p>
<p>“What do you think. Shopping of course.”</p>
<p>He groaned beneath his breath.</p>
<p>“Come on let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Amethyst.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I still have some work to do and then we have to return back to the palace.”</p>
<p>“Impossible, nuh-uh, no way.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was not about to let him get away. She smiled cheekily and grabbed his strong arms and led him as far away from the carriage. Even though he was more than capable of pulling her back, he decided not to. But he did fuss and complain as Amethyst dragged him as she pleased.</p>
<p>They looked at books in a large bookstore, passed by a small jewelry shop with cute jewelry on display. Rather, she stopped and looked, he would just stop where she stopped.</p>
<p>“Wow! That looks delicious! Alec, look! Doesn’t it look delicious? Let’s go inside.” Amethyst entered a dessert place that was exuding a sweet aroma and found an empty table. A polite server came over to take their order.</p>
<p>“What are you going to have Alec? Let’s order one each and share. This and this, and…<em> oh no</em>, they all look sooo good.”</p>
<p>While Amethyst was absorbed in the menu, a firm voice spoke. “Bring everything on the menu.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.” The server, who was aware of who he was, greeted them politely and left. “Alec! That’s too much. We won’t be able to eat everything.”</p>
<p>“Like I told you before, why waste your time contemplating?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean waste time? There’s so much joy in choosing what you want.”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you to save yourself the trouble and save that time.”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess that’s easy for rich people like you. But for me who earns a living on a daily—”</p>
<p>“Daily what?”</p>
<p>“N-nothing. I was just feeling too happy.” She said, followed by a nervous laugh.</p>
<p>She then quickly closed her mouth, realizing she had nearly made a mistake. A brief awkward moment passed but thankfully the server brought the prepared cake, tarts and pie and lay it out on the table in front of them.</p>
<p>“What may I serve first?”</p>
<p>“The cake!” Amethyst exclaimed excitedly. Then she eagerly took a fork and brought it to her mouth. As the soft texture and sweat taste exploded in her mouth, she savored the taste with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>Next, she took a bite of the pie. The crispness of the pastry amazed her.</p>
<p>“It’s so crispy!”</p>
<p>Whatever she ate, she never fell short of compliments. Fascinated, Alexcent smiled. Then he brushed the crumbs from Amethyst’s mouth who was focused on only the food in front of her.</p>
<p>“Others will think that I don’t feed you.”</p>
<p>“All the desert here is so good that I can eat it even though I’m so full. You should try some too!”</p>
<p>“No. I’m fine, you should just enjoy yourself.”</p>
<p>“What? Why? You’ll regret it later.”</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>They looked at each other for a moment before Alexcent sighed and looked at Amethyst disapprovingly.</p>
<p>“Do you…perhaps not like sweet things?” She asked slowly.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“And what?”</p>
<p>“You keep looking at me like that.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Like you don’t want to be here?” She guessed vaguely but was surprised by his answer.</p>
<p>“Because I don’t.”</p>
<p><em>“Excuse me?” </em>Her voice raised slightly over his.</p>
<p>“It is a waste of time sitting here like this.”</p>
<p><em>“Waste of time?”</em></p>
