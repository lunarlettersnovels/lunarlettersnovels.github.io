            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 77</strong></p>
<p>“Let go!” Alexcent roared.</p>
<p>“Just—” Jen knew a losing battle when he saw one. “Keep your composure. Now is not the time. Only when she calls for help… Then… Then I won’t try and stop you.”</p>
<p>“You know exactly what kind of sick bastard Dajal is!”</p>
<p>Without thinking, Jen blurted out. “But you’re the one who has been overlooking him this entire time!” And with that Officer Jen hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Alexcent froze. “What the…?” Suddenly a cloud of frost rained on his rage. “Is that the same as this?”</p>
<p>“I know you want to give her strength, but… don’t you want to see her reign before that?”</p>
<p>Alexcent stiffened but said nothing. His eyes were fixed on the door, the letter in his hand crumpled to beyond recognition.</p>
<p>“Please, just wait a little bit longer. I’m sure she will think of something.”</p>
<p>“That’s not how aristocratic women work,” Alexcent said slowly. “Since they’re raised in nobility and comfort, they are oblivious to how the world works.”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, I don’t know what you’re worried about,” said Jen, “but please trust me and leave it to her. In the meantime, you can’t let Lady Amethyst’s efforts go to waste.”</p>
<p>Alexcent sighed loudly, trying to calm his raging mind. “I dislike you,” he said, looking down at Jen, “as much as I do Lunia.”</p>
<p>Jen felt some of the tension leave his body. “I can understand me, but why Lunia?”</p>
<p>Alexcent carried on as though he hadn’t heard him. “It’s disgraceful that you know so much and say nothing. I hardly had to blink and here you are, sounding like Lunia.” He scoffed. “You make me sick.”</p>
<p>“That is correct, but Lunia is not serving you right now, she is serving Lady Amethyst.” Jen helpfully reminded.</p>
<p>“I know!” Alexcent snapped.</p>
<p>“That means her master is Lady Amethyst, not you, Sir. It is only natural that she is Lunia’s number one priority. You know what Lunia is like.”</p>
<p>“Which is why she is disgraceful and repulsive, much like yourself.” The duke hissed. He was disgruntled of Jen’s indifference towards his wife’s dangerous stunt. Right now, he was filled with anger, Jen knew he was saying things he didn’t exactly mean.</p>
<p>Jen reined in his urge to retort, agreeing was easier at this moment. “I am aware, Sir. That is why I need your approval of those documents.”</p>
<p>Later, having barely calmed his liege, Jen exited the office, a bunch of papers in hand. The altercation with the duke had left him with thoughts that demanded answers. <em>If that is the case, what is Lady Amethyst thinking?</em> I<em> wonder if it’s right that you are stopped…</em></p>
<p>He shook his head slowly, giving way to the whims in his mind. <em>Dajal, of all people… I thought it would be okay because I didn’t notice his appearance… </em>He just couldn’t get rid of the nervous thoughts that cluttered his head.</p>
<p>Once he’d returned to his own office, he opened his desk drawer and took out a different document. It was Aran Bank’s customer management list. As he stared down at it, more thoughts and questions bombarded him.</p>
<p><em>Should he tell Lady Amethyst? Or take advantage of Lunia…?</em></p>
<p><em>I’d surely hear no end to Alexcent’s nagging, but it’s not like I’m nervous…</em></p>
<p>Jen shook his head violently. <em>Is the duke contagious? How is it that he too was worried about Lady Amethyst?</em></p>
<p><em>Okay, </em>he reasoned with himself, <em>It’s not that I’m nervous. I just need a little bit of help…</em></p>
<p>This was because, the day something really did happen, the first head to roll wouldn’t be Dajal’s but his.</p>
<p>Jen’s body tensed. As much as he tried to convince himself he wasn’t nervous, he was near certain it would be the death of him. He frowned and picked up the document. Before he could get the data he needed from the bank, the thing that he’d been worried about, happened.</p>
<p>Jen recalled the time and brought his hand up and fiddled idly with his neck. Relief that his neck was still intact washed over him. He was more concerned about Amethyst, even though she was only in a contractual marriage.</p>
<p>※</p>
<p>The mansion was busy all morning. Carriages rolled in one after another, and even though the banquet hall was already full, there was a line of carriages full of people still waiting to enter.</p>
<p>Rather than shopping, Amethyst’s goal had been to learn the currency value of the Kingodm of Sehar. If she were to live alone later, she had to somehow know the value of the money. And, she discovered that the best way to do that was buying things. She’d compare her purchases to the value of things where she lived and work out the value of the ‘ar’, the monetary unit here.</p>
<p>“One ar equals… one dollar?” she whispered to herself.</p>
<p>The price of a single apple hovered somewhere around two ars, however, it was said that five apples usually cost around ten dollars. She had to master probability calculations. If she made even the slightest mistake, she’d lose money or get totally ripped off. While Amethyst ran calculations through her head, Lunia, along with several maids, started looking through the dresses.</p>
<p>“How much is this one?”</p>
<p>“Eight thousand ars so… about eight-thousand dollars? For one dress! This is madness! Who the hell would buy this!”</p>
<p>Having not seen each other for a long while, Lunia and the maids were making the best of their time together by chatting excitedly amongst themselves. They paid no attention to Amethyst’s expression of disbelief and awe.</p>
<p>“Madam.” Came the voice of one of the maids. “How about this dress? The soft cream and dark green ribbon will go wonderfully with your complexion, Lady Amethyst. You usually like light clothes.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s what I thought! I think it will go well with the colour of your eyes, Lady Amethyst.” Chipped in a second maid.</p>
<p>After seeing the prices, Lady Amethyst hurriedly shook her head. “No, no… it’s okay.” However, her eyes lingered on the garment before she tore her gaze away.</p>
<p>“Then how about this one? You’ll look stunning in this seductive red, Madam.” Offered a third maid.</p>
<p>“The colour just about matches Master’s eyes,” said another, “If the two of you stand side by side in this dress, it would be perfect.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Amethyst scanned the dress, tempted by their comments.</p>
<p>It was the most beautiful dress she’d seen the entire day. Feathers ran along the chest line, embellished jewels glittering at the waistband. The wide, pleated skirt was reminiscent of a rose. Just as she was considering it, her eye caught sight of the price. Her awe quickly morphed into panic.</p>
<p><em>This one had one more ‘0’ on it than the last dress!</em></p>
