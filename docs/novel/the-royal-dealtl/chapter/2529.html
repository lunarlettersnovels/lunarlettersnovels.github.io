            <p><strong>Chapter 139</strong></p>
<p>“Are you sure you don’t want to take the knights with you?”</p>
<p>“It’s a hassle.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was seeing Alexcent off. He was about to depart for the hunting match.</p>
<p>“But…” began Amethyst.</p>
<p>“It’s fine,” said Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Are you only taking Gen with you?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“It’s convenient for me that way,” said he.</p>
<p>Amethyst stared at him for a while. He claimed that taking knights with him was a hassle. Unlike the other nobles, only Skad household seemed to have very less guards. Alexcent was making the journey with Gen alone.</p>
<p>“Then travel safely,” said Amethyst with a smile, “Don’t get hurt or anything.”</p>
<p>Alexcent stared at her, puzzled about that smile.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“That smile,” said Alexcent, “It worries me. It almost looks like you are planning something.”</p>
<p>“Is it a crime for me to offer you a smile and wish you a safe trip?” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“No,” said Alexcent, unconvinced, “I will be back soon. Don’t cause trouble while I am gone.”</p>
<p>“Well, no promises here,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Ash,” said Alexcent, wearily.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay!” said Amethyst, “Now go. Everyone must be waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” said Alexcent, stroking her cheek, “I am sure nothing will go amiss but… take care of yourself.”</p>
<p><em>If you are that worried, why won’t you let me come with you? </em>Amethyst grumbled inwardly. She nodded, otherwise Alexcent would never move from the spot. Finally, he got on his horse. He smiled at her and sent his horse into a gallop. Gen and Alexcent rode away.</p>
<p>“Now that the naggy one is finally gone,” said Amethyst, “We can get started.”</p>
<p>“Madam,” said Lunia, worried, “Are you sure about this?”</p>
<p>“Of course!” said Amethyst, “Lunia, don’t you think about backing out at the last minute! Who was the one who told me to come up with a good plan to keep the ladies entertained?”</p>
<p>“I…,” Lunia sighed, “Alright. I will go and gather the ladies.”</p>
<p>“Great!” said Amethyst, “I will go get ready as well.”</p>
<p>Lunia nodded and hastened to prepare everything. Amethyst made her way back to the mansion with Roman. A few moments after, the ladies were all gathered at the entrance.</p>
<p>“Are you all ready?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Of course, Lady Skad!” intoned the ladies</p>
<p>“I am so excited,” said one of the ladies, “My goodness! Camping!”</p>
<p>“My sentiments exactly!” said the other, “If it wasn’t for Lady Skad, we would have just been locked here doing nothing.”</p>
<p>“You have no idea how hard it was for me to keep it a secret!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days ago, everyone had been surprised when Amethyst shared her plans during a secret meeting.</p>
<p>“Camping?!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Lady Skad, and how does one do that?” Countess Onslow asked with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“We put up a tent in the mountains or the fields, cook for ourselves, sing and dance. We salvage and live off what we find. That’s camping!”</p>
<p>“Without any maids?”</p>
<p>“Exactly!” said Amethyst, “Where’s the fun in letting the maids do everything?! We can cook our own soup, grill our own meat…we split up the work and share the load.”</p>
<p>“Well that is true,” said Baroness Renove, “I have only ever received services from the maids. I think it will be fun to try to do things on our own for a change.”</p>
<p>“Baroness Renove, it will be so fun,” said Amethyst, “At night, we can build a bonfire and gather around drinking tea, talking, singing and watching the stars.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the normally quiet and timid Baroness Zephyr joined in enthusiastically. “It sounds so romantic! Watching the stars!” she exclaimed, “Lady Skad, when do we prepare?”</p>
<p>“I will have everything arranged,” said Amethyst, “All you have to do is pack comfortable attires. Don’t pack dresses. Mighty uncomfortable in the woods.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“I really love this year’s annual festival!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Alexcent disapproved of her going to the hunting match, he had said nothing about camping. So, she wasn’t really breaking her word or going against him. She was simply skirting the loopholes. After all, attending to the noble ladies was solely her responsibility. So, Alec cannot object to this either.</p>
<p>Amethyst, ever so cunningly, prepared for the camping trip in secret with help from Lunia and Roman. Once Alec and the other nobles were gone, she gathered the ladies. They were ready for their own camping trip!</p>
<p>“No!” exclaimed Pon, who blocked their way. They were unexpectedly ambushed in their departures. “Please, madam,” he said to Amethyst, “Please don’t do this!”</p>
<p>“Move aside, Pon,” said Amethyst with a sigh.</p>
<p>“No, you mustn’t do this!” said Pon, desperately, “It is very dangerous. How could you expect the ladies to sleep outside without anyone attending to them? Without servants or guards! Please reconsider.”</p>
<p>“It will be fine, Pon,” said Amethyst, “I will take Roman and Lunia with us. Are we good now?”</p>
<p>“Madam,” said Pon in disbelief, “That is not what I mean. If the duke finds out…”</p>
<p>“Pon!” interrupted Amethyst, “It is my responsibility to keep the ladies engaged while the others are away for their hunting match. As the Lady of the Household, I don’t think I need to seek approval for this.” Pon lowered his head. “Now, move aside.”</p>
<p>“Madam, please,” pleaded Pon, “The woods might be full of wild animals. It is physically unsafe for ladies to venture out.”</p>
<p>“How insolent!” thundered Countess Onslow, “How dare a servant try to stop Lady Skad? Isn’t this an example of mutiny?”</p>
<p>“It seems so, Countess Onslow,” Countess Citri chimed in, “Servants seem to have no respect for the Lady Skad.”</p>
<p>Pon was stunned and speechless as he watched the timid and shy ladies that he had served for years turn assertive and side with the Lady Skad. “No, my lady,” stammered Pon, “I am simply concerned about your safety. The woods are dangerous.”</p>
