            <p><strong>Chapter 273</strong></p>
<p>“Duke Alexcent Frostin Skad.” Alexcent’s name was announced as he entered the Empress’ ball alone. The guests stared as he walked, whispering to each other.</p>
<p>“See. The rumour of the Duchess being spotted was false,” one guest said.</p>
<p>“You’re right. Why else would the duke attend the ball by himself? Especially one that is hosted by the Empress,” another guest whispered.</p>
<p>“The Duchess really was…” a third guest began before being hushed by her partner.</p>
<p>Alexcent heard the whispering amongst the crowd, but he didn’t care about anything they said. He knew the truth and that was all that mattered.</p>
<p>But one person would not be satisfied until he knew the truth about the Duchess. Count Lohikin. When he believed that he had lost his daughter, he relinquished his title of Count to his son, then headed directly to the Skad mansion to find out the truth.</p>
<p>Count Lohikin couldn’t believe his daughter would leave without telling him anything, especially if she was just studying abroad. But he wasn’t allowed a meeting with Duke Skad. He went back to the castle gates every day and was always turned away. Then, suddenly, he was told that the duke was no longer at the palace. That was when he heard the rumours. Duke Skad had gone into hiding after murdering the Duchess.</p>
<p>Count Lohikin began searching for his daughter, with the obsession of a madman. Since she had been said to be studying abroad, he checked with all of the academies he could think of. None of the schools had ever admitted his daughter. In Count Lohikin’s mind, the rumours were formulating into the truth.</p>
<p>Count Lohikin began to grow thin. He would sit in front of the Skad mansion and refuse to move. It didn’t matter if he was drenched in cold rain, or pounded with heat until he almost fainted, he never left. When that didn’t work, he took back his title from his son so he could attend this one ball and finally meet the man himself.</p>
<p>Count Lohikin thought this was his chance. If he couldn’t meet the duke one on one, then he would confront the man in front of all the other nobles.</p>
<p>Martin, his son, had insisted that the Count didn’t look well. Martin wanted to go in his place and confront the Duke to get answers about his sister. Martin had become quite the man, but Count Lohikin had insisted on being the one to do it, for the sake of the family. He didn’t want the blame landing on his son. Everyone knew full well what Duke Skad could do to a person he had a vengeance against.</p>
<p>Count Lohikin had prepared for the ball, making sure everything was just right. When the Duke Skad entered the hall, he couldn’t take his eyes off of him. Following the Duke, the entrance of the Empress was announced. Everyone in the hall bowed as her name was announced. Belice saw Alexcent standing alone, and looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>“May the glory of the Great Empire of Sehar and blessing of Our Majesty the Empress be one!” Everyone in the hall shouted this greeting. Belice took her eyes away from Alexcent and smiled.</p>
<p>“Everyone, please rise,” Belice announced. “I’m very happy that you are brightening up my ball today with your presence. Please, enjoy the festivities. Let the music begin.” Everyone clapped and the orchestra began to play.</p>
<p>Belice approached Alexcent. “What, are you alone?”</p>
<p>“When was I not?” Alexcent replied. “I’m not playing your little game.”</p>
<p>“Game. This ball was the chance to extinguish all those nasty rumours.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care about the rumours. They were all wrong in the first place. She has no reason to be to here. Especially with people, like that old man, who are looking like they want to kill me. It’s safer for her to stay away.”</p>
<p>Belice turned her head to where Alexcent was looking. There was an older man glaring at them from across the dance floor.</p>
<p>“Of course he thinks he lost his daughter. It’s understandable. But she’s back again. I mean…” Belice seemed to be lost for words.</p>
<p>“Not exactly Count Lohikin’s daughter.” Alexcent put emphasis in his words.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s good. What about her duties as a duchess?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Alexent, she’s your life partner.”</p>
<p>It was when the siblings were whispering in an inaudible voice when an angry Count Rohkin stood before them and greeted them.</p>
<p>“I offer my greetings to Her Majesty, the Empress.”</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time. Count Lohikin.” Belice returned the gesture and threw an amicable smile to the worried father.</p>
<p>“We haven’t spoken in a while, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve heard that you’ve been honored by your great son.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You did a great job raising the lad. Wouldn’t it be better if there were more young talents in the empire?</p>
<p>“I see. I am glad that the hard work I do for the empire, in the embodiment of my son, is appreciated. If so, please grant me a request.” Now, Count Lohikin was no longer addressing the empress—his eyes set firmly on the man beside Belice.</p>
<p>Sensing the aggression in the count’s voice, Alexcent raised his brows. This was no place and time to talk business, however, Alexcent respects the man and let him continue.</p>
<p>“Sure. It’s a happy day after all, Count Lohikin.”</p>
<p>There was a subtle tremor in Count Lohikin’s voice as he uttered, “Give me back my daughter’s body.” Instantly, his words drew the attention of the people around one person. Alexcent. Did the duke killed his wife?</p>
<p>“The body of your daughter. What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, no one believes my daughter is studying abroad. Also, no one is saying that my daughter is alive.”</p>
<p>“Count Lohikin.” Belice looked embarrassed; her eyes swiveled between the two men as she tried to pacify the count.</p>
<p>Alexcent was not perturbed. It’s true that Count Lohikin’s daughter has died. Although Alexcent could not provide a body, he was willing to inform the man of his daughter’s passing even if that would mean ending things with the Lohikins.</p>
<p>But as soon as he was about to reply on behalf of Belice, a servant had shouted.</p>
<p>“The Duchess of Emesis Skad has arrived.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s gaze immediately focused on the woman coming into the banquet hall at the sound of a single word.</p>
