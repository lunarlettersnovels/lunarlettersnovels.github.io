            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 48</strong></p>
<p>As she took in the assembled entourage, she recognized the maids that tended to her every day. And then there were those she saw on rotation in the evening. They all stood upright and in a row.</p>
<p>“There’s quite a lot.”</p>
<p>“Normally the manpower averages around this much, Madam.” Pon politely filled her in.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p><em>Well, I suppose the main mansion is pretty large, so to clean it they must require many. </em>Amethyst slowly observed each of them from head to toe. <em>As expected….! They are different from the maid I met earlier on.</em></p>
<p>She paid close attention to the sleeves of the maids. <em>It’s the same. The uniform is the same but… Why are the clothes on this maid and the maid before so different?</em></p>
<p>The maid she had met earlier had extremely frayed sleeves. The hem of her skirt seemed to have been patched up several times as well. Whereas the clothes of the maids that worked in the main mansion appeared brand new. To think that there would be such a big difference even in the same clothes.</p>
<p>All the maids in front of her were the same as the first one she had inspected. After a while, she said, “Thank you, everyone. You are all busy, you may return to your duties now.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” The maids chorused.</p>
<p>They tilted their heads and looked at one other as they didn’t know the reason the new mistress had summoned them. Even though they were curious, none put much thought into it as the lady of the house had always acted in a rather peculiar manner, unlike a noble lady.</p>
<p>“Pon.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Are you the one in charge of the employees in the main mansion?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That is correct, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Then what about the side mansion?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I am not in charge of them. The ones outside of the main mansion are being managed by Dajal. I’m afraid it is too much for me to manage on my own,” he truthfully replied.</p>
<p>“I suppose that is true. Even those within are so many. Sorry, did you say Dajal?”</p>
<p>It sounded like a name she had heard before, but she couldn’t place a finger on it.</p>
<p>“Yes. He used to manage this place even before the duke became the master and has served generations of the Skad family.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then how many years has it been since you’ve started working here? Did you come here with Alec as he became the duke?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve served His Highness since he was young. We moved after he received the title of Duke, it must be 7~8 years now.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm … I see. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“My pleasure. Please call on me if you need anything else,” Pon sincerely said.</p>
<p>“Yes. I will.”</p>
<p>Amethyst was lost in her thoughts as she made her way back to her bedroom. Since Pon had moved in with Alexcent, and Dajal was in-charge of the affairs outside of the main mansion, it meant the butler was not involved or aware.</p>
<p><em>I didn’t see the maid I saw earlier amongst the others working in the main mansion. So I suppose she is a maid that works outside of the main mansion. I suppose her clothes are a big proof. None of the maids in the mansion were wearing clothes of such a poor state.</em></p>
<p><em>But that maid just now…</em></p>
<p>It had been frayed to the extent that it was hard to believe that they were the same livery. Even her hand had been rough and full of scars, whereas those in the mansion, although their hands weren’t saved from the work, were not as bad as hers.</p>
<p><em>Something… smells fishy.</em></p>
<p><em>I wonder why I have an instinct for these things. I guess I must have watched too much CSI.</em></p>
<p>As Amethyst entered her bedroom her head was caught in her chain of thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Dajal … Dajal, huh … his name already sounds fishy.</em></p>
<p><em>Sigh, but I promised not to get involved.</em></p>
<p><em>I shall not get involved!</em></p>
<p><em>But that maid … ah, she worries me.</em></p>
<p>Thinking back to the group of knights that had sexually harassed the maid, she was reminded of her first job and the very first team-lead.</p>
<p>At the very start of her work life, her first boss was the worst person ever. He would use his authority and title to bully female employees and was the kind you never wanted to meet ever again. He was especially cruel towards her who was new to the work atmosphere and taking her first steps.</p>
<p><em>Dammit … I am going overboard. But my curiosity is just driving me crazy!</em></p>
<p>In her bedroom, Amethyst walked around in circles then finally went out. Just as she exited her room she ran into Lunia.</p>
<p>“Madam, where are you going?” she asked politely.</p>
