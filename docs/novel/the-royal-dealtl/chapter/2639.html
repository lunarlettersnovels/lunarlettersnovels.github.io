            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 34 – A First (1) | 19</strong></p>
<p>His long and thick finger pen3trated her.</p>
<p>“Ah! Tha-”</p>
<p>Amethyst flushed scarlet as she felt his presence inside of her and found herself instinctively tightening the muscles of her inner thighs. He leaned down, surveyed the delirious look in her eyes, and whispered in her ear with a sly smile.</p>
<p>“How want0n of you to react like that already.”</p>
<p>“It’s not-! Ah…like that-”</p>
<p><em>‘How could he call me a want0n when I’ve lived like a saint all my life! This is my absolute first time, after all! If I derive any pleasure out of it, I’m rightly entitled to it</em>.’</p>
<p>She had never experienced this before. Neither in this life nor in her previous one. The kind of relationship she was accustomed to, involved minimal physical exchanges that were nothing but brief. Even those were a rarity once the children were born.</p>
<p>However, she had never once complained.</p>
<p>She had every intention of avoiding contact with the relationship that had given her nothing but heartache and hurt. For that reason, she often pretended to be deep asleep when he returned and alternatively would sleep with the kids often.</p>
<p>However, right then, it felt nothing like that.</p>
<p>Everything in her was alive and aware for the first time, and she didn’t think she had much chance against his guileless love. The sweet and genuine kisses, and physical interaction of the loving kind, was a new experience for her.</p>
<p>She closed her two eyes, soaking in the blissful sensations as her face turned pink with pleasure.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you’re thinking about something else right now. I better try harder.”</p>
<p>His finger reached even deeper and moved roughly inside her, causing a warm fluid to flow down her inner thigh.</p>
<p>Mortified, she covered her flushed face with her hands. His lips centred at her bre@sts, paused mid-action. He pushed himself up and spread her th!ghs apart with his large hands.</p>
<p>“Don’t look. It’s so embarrassing.”</p>
<p>As Amethyst stuttered in embarrassment, Alexcent placed his lips on her inner thigh and licked at the warm fluid.</p>
<p>“Ha…hmm…oh please.” She moaned in pleasure, her words slowly drawled out and her voice loud.</p>
<p>‘<em>Ah, this is driving me crazy…I feel like I am going to explode.</em>’</p>
<p>As his breath tickled her thighs, he felt like it was burning her up. She wriggled her toes in exhilaration.</p>
<p>Amethyst, unable to bear it any longer, lifted the hand covering her face, and gripped the bed sheet, trembling in pleasure. Subconsciously, she matched the pace of his breathing.</p>
<p>“Ha….so sweet. It’s like a drug, driving me crazy.”</p>
<p>He lifted his head and smiled, discarding the gown he had been wearing, on to the floor.</p>
<p><em>Oh my god.</em></p>
<p>His wide shoulders and prominent collar bone. The toned muscles forming his tight ab, and…</p>
<p>Amethyst, unable to tear her eyes away from Alexcent’s n@ked body, caught herself and lowered her gaze in surprise.</p>
<p>“Alec, wait….”</p>
<p>Feeling almost dizzy with nervousness, she tried to avoid the unavoidable. He, however, was far too excited to even consider slowing down, and showed no mercy. He took hold of her ankles and pulled her in towards him, immediately inserting himself deeply inside her.</p>
<p>He was way too impatient to give her a chance to reject him. He let out a loud m0an as he felt himself engulfed by warm heat and its fluid.</p>
<p>Amethyst felt like she had been struck by lightning as she felt him moving inside of her, and felt a strong wave of pain. She cried out as she felt her skin being torn.</p>
<p>“Please, it hurts….stop” She begged as she almost sobbed.</p>
<p><em>This isn’t my first time, but for Amethyst’s body, it was different. Oh no! I can no longer distinguish who I mean by myself anymore</em>.</p>
<p>Alexcent, intoxicated by her sweet floral scent, came to a halt as he smelled blood in the air and looked down at her in surprise.</p>
<p>“Wait….was this your first time?!”</p>
<p>She looked up at him with tears in her eyes. Alexcent swore under his breath, before lifting her up and placing her on top of his thighs. He kissed her softly and hugged her as he patted her back soothingly.</p>
<p>Slowly her sobbing died down.</p>
<p>“I am sorry. Are you alright now?”</p>
<p>Amethyst nodded with flushed cheeks, unable to look into his eyes. She was embraced by him for a long time; she sensed that he didn’t seem to have any plans of letting her go.</p>
<p>As soon as she calmed down, he immediately tried to touch her again. Alexcent carefully lay her back on the bed, and very slowly felt her deeply again.</p>
<p>This time, it was soft and gentle with no hints of roughness like the previous time.</p>
<p>He carefully scrutinized every expression of hers as he continued. He kissed her briefly on her lips to reassure her. As he slowly and gently carried on, her pain quickly changed to pleasure and she found herself m0aning out loud.</p>
<p>“Hmmm. Ahhh, ahhh.”</p>
<p>He entered her deeply and started to move his hips slowly against hers. Her m0ans matched the pace of his movement.</p>
<p>His large hands pinched her n!pples, and his lips traced every inch of skin on her body. Their sweat covered bodies collided with each other as l3wd sounds echoed in the entire bedroom.</p>
<p>A short while later, succumbing to her pleasure and reaching her cl!max, Amethyst let out a cry and let herself go, as Alec too let go and lay on top of her.</p>
