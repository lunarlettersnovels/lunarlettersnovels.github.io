            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 6 – A Doting Father (1)</strong></p>
<p>That night, Amethyst was requested by Count Lohikin for a private audience. And it was not long ‘till she found herself knocking at his door.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>As she entered she looked at the room, smell of old wood, smoke, and a faint floral scent from the flowers that emanated from the vase on the table wafted up her nostrils. She took a seat at the plush chair in front of his desk, across from him.</p>
<p>He was her father, but she had no idea what to expect from him, which made her nervous. Her own father, the one she knew, had never been affectionate. Grim and cold, he was the typical patriarchal figure, deep-rooted in his opinions, refusing to tolerate anything other than what they believe to be right.</p>
<p><em>‘I won’t be surprised if the Count is exactly like that. I really expect no miracles from men.’</em></p>
<p>“I have something to tell you.”</p>
<p>Count Lohikin simply looked at his daughter who appeared far from her usual self.</p>
<p>Somehow, she could feel the warmth in his gaze and felt herself subconsciously relaxing. ‘<em>So he did care for </em>Amethyst<em>.’</em></p>
<p>“Father, like I said this morning, I have no desire to marry. I’d like to be clear on that matter. I hope you will decline the marriage proposal to marry into the family of the Marquis of Crenson.”</p>
<p>Count Lohikin’s eyebrows shot up in surprise but he otherwise remained calm. She couldn’t tell if he were displeased with her resistance or impressed.</p>
<p>“But this is completely different from what you said yesterday. Do you realise that?”</p>
<p><em>‘Oh god. Right, yesterday… Just what had </em>Amethyst <em>done the day before?’</em></p>
<p><em>‘But hold on, there was no need for me to forcefully bring up something I don’t know anything about. I can just bypass that!’</em></p>
<p>“Yes. I’m sorry. I’m sure this puts father in a difficult position. But I am most certain that I want to decline this marriage.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Count Lohikin silently stroked his beard, apparently deep in thought.</p>
<p>“Actually…I understand to some extent why you caused a scene. I’m sure you felt impatient after hearing the news of your friend Marai’s engagement.”</p>
<p><em>‘Marai? Who is that? Anyway, I really don’t care at all whether she gets married or not, as long as it isn’t me.’</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Please God, don’t let it be me.</strong></em></p>
<p>“Honestly, I felt a little upset when you caused a scene…” Count Lohikin couldn’t stop the chuckle that escaped his lips as he recalled his precious daughter’s stunt just the day before. “Perhaps this is for the better. If that is how you feel, then so be it. I only expect one thing. That is your happiness.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Amethyst was speechless with delight.</p>
<p><em>‘Hallelujah!’</em></p>
<p>He was an ideal father, the kind that often appeared in morning dramas as the heroine’s father, always considerate of his daughter’s wishes.</p>
<p><em>‘Well, well, well…Who knew fathers like that could exist? Now, I have one like that of my own!’</em></p>
<p>She was convinced this new life of hers was a gift from God, a compensation for all the miseries she had faced in her past life.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll talk to Marquis Crenson.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, father.” Amethyst grinned at him in gratitude. However, to her surprise, the count started to frown. Did her reaction somehow made Lohikin upset?</p>
<p>“They say when daughters grow up, they don’t like to associate with their fathers as much, so I guess that’s what we are going through now. My little girl seems to be keeping her distance from me more and more…” Count Lohikin said forlornly, looking at his eldest child with affection.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah, they must have gotten along well. I’m not surprised.’</em></p>
<p>“No. That’s not true.”</p>
<p>“Even this morning you forgot your morning greeting…and you don’t smile much these days…”</p>
<p><em>‘Morning greeting? Oh…Was he referring to the kiss on the cheek I saw Merrild and Matin do, this morning? Oh my. Their relationship must have been more than just good. She was definitely on better terms with her father than I had expected.’</em></p>
<p>To think that this cool-headed middle-aged man was in low spirits because of his daughter’s lack of greeting. Amethyst felt a pang of guilt for causing that.</p>
<p>“I’ll try not to forget it tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Looking at Amethyst’s smile, the count looked convinced, “Alright. Is there anything else you want to say?”</p>
<p>“Ah! I have a favour to ask you, father.”</p>
<p>“A favour?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I was wondering if I could get a tutor.”</p>
<p>“A tutor?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Can’t I?”</p>
<p>“Well it’s not difficult to get you one, but you’ve already graduated from the academy.”</p>
<p><em>‘Oops. Mistake no. 3’</em></p>
<p><em>‘Does that mean I’ve already graduated from school? But I still have so much I need to learn about this world. If I keep asking Yellie she’s going to think I’ve gone mad.’</em></p>
<p>“Well…I want to learn things I didn’t learn while I was at the academy.”</p>
<p>“For example?”</p>
<p>Wherever you go, what you learn in school is about the same. I’m sure the same applies to this world; I must have studied only academic subjects.</p>
<p>After all, in my past life, schools didn’t teach me about how to survive when one steps put of society.</p>
<p>“…I want to learn more about the world.”</p>
<p>“What?!” A bolstering laughter filled the room.” Really, you are still an oddball!”</p>
<p><em>‘W…Was I?’</em></p>
<p>As Count Lohikin laughed out loudly, Amethyst couldn’t help but laugh along.</p>
<p>“Alright. I will look into it. Will a cultural tutor do?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it. Is there anything else you need?”</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>“Alright. I will be up a little longer as I have things I need to finish some official documents. You go ahead and go to bed.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Don’t stay up too late.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Good night.”</p>
<p>As she turned to leave, Count Lohikin coughed, looking at Amethyst expectantly.</p>
<p>“Ahem, ahem.”</p>
<p><em>‘Hmm, what was this? What’s with those expectant eyes? Could it be…?</em></p>
<p><em>‘Ah’.</em> Amethyst smiled as she stood up from her seat and carefully pecked Count Lohikin’s cheek.</p>
<p>“Good night.”</p>
<p>For Amethyst it felt awkward but the Count seemed satisfied and happy.</p>
