            <p><strong>Chapter 168</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst couldn’t believe it. “Just because I’m Lady Skad, to think I would receive such a thing. That’s amazing!”</p>
<p>“Madam, that is common tradition.”</p>
<p>“Too many things are common tradition, that’s the problem.” Amethyst never knew what was expected of her.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. We’ll make sure the preparations are thoroughly organized.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Then I’ll leave it to you, Lunia.”</p>
<p>“The welcoming ceremony will be more important than the appointment ceremony.”</p>
<p>“Welcome ceremony?” How much more was there?</p>
<p>“The welcoming ceremony is managed by you, Madam, in honor of the new knights.”</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying that I need to prepare the events of the welcoming ceremony?” Amethyst knew she wouldn’t have the first clue what to do.</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s right.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you could organize it exactly like the year before. I don’t know anything about this event.” Amethyst was at a loss.</p>
<p>“Exactly like the year before?” Lunia was beginning to understand that Amethyst wanted to minimize her efforts again.</p>
<p>“That won’t do?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not impossible. Didn’t you form any friendships with the knights when you practiced your swordsmanship? I think it would be best if you put in some effort, that’s all.” Lunia’s words made sense. They were the knights whom she spent time with since she came to the mansion. Amethyst had learnt her swordsmanship with their help, so now it was her turn to return the favour.</p>
<p>“Where will the ceremony be held?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Since all the knights are attending, it should be in the larger banquet hall.”</p>
<p>“All the knights?” Amethyst’s eyes widened. There were a lot of knights. “What’s the total number?”</p>
<p>“The Skad household knights consist of ten units. The number of people in each unit depends on the group number. The first unit consists of ten knights, while the second unit consists of twenty and so on,” Lunia explained.</p>
<p>“So, then the tenth unit has 100 knights?”</p>
<p>“Right now, it’s 95. The soldiers that harassed the maids have been dismissed,” Lunia looked enraged when she brought that fact up.</p>
<p>“There are relatively fewer first knights. Does that mean they are considered the most elite unit?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“You can think of it similar to a tournament bracket,” Lunia said. “New knights start in the tenth unit and progress up the ranks step by step, according to their abilities. There are lead knights in each unit, while Lord Hilder is the lead of all units. Including the new knights, there are 571 soldiers in total.”</p>
<p>Even though that sounded like a lot, Amethyst thought about the size of the mansion they had to protect.</p>
<p>Lunia continued. “The knight’s skills are outstanding. Our household probably has the most elite soldiers. Even lower-level knights here are worth a hundred soldiers from other households. They can’t come close to the knights of other noble families.”</p>
<p><em>Sir Buer, the commander of the first Division, does not seem like he’s worth a hundred soldiers, </em>Amethyst thought. <em>I guess I shouldn’t judge him based on appearance. After all, if Buer is the first division commander he must be really skilled.</em></p>
<p>“I’m assuming we should prepare a feast for the dinner?” Amethyst started thinking of possibilities. “Let’s prepare a lot of greasy, meat dishes.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that your personal craving?” Lunia was smirking.</p>
<p>“No!” Amethyst protested.</p>
<p>“Please don’t be upset, it’s a common stereotype to think that knights only like meat.”</p>
<p>“Then we should go vegan?” That didn’t sound right to Amethyst.</p>
<p>Lunia pondered for a moment before replying. “I guess we should prepare mostly meat dishes.”</p>
<p>“Told you.” Amethyst smirked back. “For the decorations, we should use the vendor Floria. She is really good.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I’ll get some quotes from Floria.”</p>
<p>“Is there anything I should be thinking about?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“Since you’re already on friendly terms with the knight, you might want to pay attention to the seating arrangements.”</p>
<p>“Seating arrangements?” Amethyst couldn’t believe how much there was to consider when planning a party.</p>
<p>“Just like royal families,” Lunia explained, “Ranks are very important amongst knights. Which means the seating arrangement is very important.”</p>
<p>“Can we go with round table seating?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“Sorry?!”</p>
<p>“It must be uncomfortable being so hierarchical. Must we do that while eating? Just place everyone around circular tables so we can all eat as equals.”</p>
<p>“We could, but if you make the unit leads eat with their men, there could be issues,” Lunia said.</p>
<p>“How was it done last year?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“Along the long table, at the front, the leads of each unit sit according to their ranks. Then the newly appointed knights take their seats at the tables in front. This shows honour to who is in charge.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t we try having myself, Alec, the unit leads, and the new knights at the long table; while the rest sit freely at round tables. If that doesn’t work, we can change the location and come up with a better seating plan.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Amethyst spent the rest day in Lunia’s company going over every other minor detail of this very important event</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day of the ceremony arrived, and Amethyst was preparing herself to welcome the guests. Since she had to wear formal attire, Lunia had instructed for Amethyst’s corset to be laced three times tighter than usual.</p>
<p>“Lunia, I feel like I’m going to vomit my gut….” Amethyst was in serious pain.</p>
<p>“Please stay still. And don’t say such things in front of the knights.”</p>
<p>Amethyst groaned loudly as the straps were pulled even tighter.</p>
<p>“Miss Lunia! Madam seems to be suffering so much. Shall I stop?” Roman, who was tightening the corset from behind, asked worriedly.</p>
