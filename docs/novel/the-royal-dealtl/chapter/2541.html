            <p><strong>Chapter 127</strong></p>
<p>“Your Excellency! The tyranny of Count Fendence is getting worse every day,” complained Baron Piamon, “Not too long ago, he nearly ripped off half of our earnings! At this rate our household will not be able to take it much further. This means they are looking down on the Skad household. We must show them who we are.”</p>
<p>“Ahem,” Count Renove cleared his throat, “Baron Piamon, what do you mean we have to show them who we are? Do you mean that we should start a war?”</p>
<p>“Count Renove, if need be, we must go to war!”</p>
<p>“Well…that is really extreme.”</p>
<p>Baron Piamon continued to barrel on with his complaints. He was determined to hear a response from the duke regarding his plight. “Your Excellency! If war is not an option…then please support us with your knights! We should at least intimidate them.”</p>
<p>“You foolish man, that is the same thing! If you send out the duke’s knights, then it’s the same as declaring war against another noble household!”</p>
<p>“Then at least share a possible solution!”</p>
<p>Ever since the start of the annual festival, from conference meetings to consultations, Baron Piamon had only complained about this one thing. It was starting to annoy Alexcent. Momentarily, he indulged in the idea of beheading the lot of them.</p>
<p>Even as Count Renove and Count Houres calmed Baron Piamon and tried to talk about other things, Alexcent’s annoyance with him didn’t end. He reminded himself that he needed them on his side for the safety and stability of the throne. The thought of having to deal with these nitwits saddened him more.</p>
<p>Then, he felt a presence outside the office. Someone was shuffling outside the door. He guessed one of them was Pon, he faintly heard the voice of the other…</p>
<p><em>It can’t be! </em>He thought. There was a knock at the door. He allowed them to come in. He had been so bored with all this. As the door opened, his heart dropped a beat. The person he had wanted to see the most. <em>For whom did she dress up so prettily, </em>he mused.</p>
<p>Count Glacia, Count Renove, Count Houres and Baron Piamon, would assume that for Amethyst, this was the usual attire to receive guests as the Lady of the Household. But Alexcent knew. He knew she had taken time and effort to get dolled up which she didn’t normally do. She despised tight dresses and heels. But she looked like a goddess in his eyes, right at that instant.</p>
<p>Her lips were voluptuous and red, tempting him to bite it. <em>Why do you do this to me? Why are you seducing me like this? </em>As much as he tried to still his mind, his body reacted differently. He could feel himself becoming hard. He longed to hear her gasping. Her moans would contrast drastically to the annoying whines he had had to put up with.</p>
<p><em>This is just driving me crazy, </em>he thought, <em>this is the first time I have held myself back from her for the longest time. It has been so many days. I wish she would leave fast. I can’t take this anymore.</em></p>
<p>But Baron Piamon invited her to stay longer and she obliged. And she wouldn’t sit next to him! She accepted a seat between Baron Piamon and Count Houres. <em>Does this mean she no longer wishes to stay close to me?</em></p>
<p>He pretended not to be affected and stayed silent. He felt something indescribable. He didn’t want her to be here right now, because she affected him so much. But at the same time, he longed for her so much. And she wouldn’t even sit next to him! He felt enraged, and he felt annoyed at her for torturing him like this.</p>
<p><em>Fine, </em>he thought, <em>let’s see how far you go. </em>With massive effort he suppressed his emotions. But when Baron Piamon offered her alcohol, he reacted instinctively. He didn’t want her to drink and fall sick like last time, but as she sipped it, he felt helpless. As he watched her sip the drink, he wished her lips were on his, instead.</p>
<p>He tried hard not to focus on that. He tried to calm himself. He breathed in deeply. He gazed at her flushed cheeks. Every night, he had imagined her in his arms, these past few days. Being away from her was agonizing. He wanted to look at that flushed face and make it blush. He frowned.</p>
<p>She pulled her head back and let her hair flow. His jaws were clenched. He longed to stroke that soft hair. He wanted to feel their strands between his fingers. He tried hard to calm himself. It was so hard to stay calm and rational and not give into his instinct, which would be to sweep Amethyst off her feet and take her to bed.</p>
<p>He sighed. He wanted to plant kisses on that pale, exposed neck and shoulders. He wanted to paint them all with reddish marks from his ministrations. The sight of her was tempting him beyond rationality. <em>I wonder if I could…. </em>He wished she was as bothered as him about this, but she seemed to have eyes only for Baron Piamon. He glared at the baron, who had managed to ensnare her attention. He wanted her eyes on him, not the baron!</p>
<p><em>Shall I just throw his glass in his face? </em>Alexcent pondered for a while. <em>It will break something or the other, but it would hardly kill him. </em>He twirled the glass in his hands and took another drink. <em>Should I or should I not? </em>He contemplated.</p>
