            <p><strong>Chapter 133</strong></p>
<p>As Amethyst entered the hall full of golden decorations, all eyes focused on her. There had been murmurs that the duke had showed up early without Lady Skad by his side. And now people whispered in low voices behind their masks seeing her now. There was silence as she walked down the room, her boots echoing off the floor. The eyes of the people followed her every step.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was tensed. It was obvious that she was in the duke’s own clothes. The vest and the huge shirt were testament to that. It was clear that she was from house Skad. The gleaming golden emblem was proof of that. Nobody had the audacity to wear the duke’s clothes and badge except the bold Lady Skad.</p>
<p>Amethyst felt self-conscious but she didn’t stop her stride. She walked confidently. She walked towards the tall man, with a glass in his hand, who stood by a woman in a red dress. She could tell it was him at one glance. His platinum blond hair shone in the light and his red eyes glittered under the mask. He was in his uniform. It set her hear pounding.</p>
<p><em>That man is surely not good for my heart, </em>she thought. <em>How can someone be so beautiful and affect me so? It is just too unreal.</em></p>
<p>Even with his mask, his charm wasn’t diminished. Perhaps the mask made people bolder because there were more ladies than usual flocking around him. There was one woman whom she didn’t want to see. The black-haired lady in a red dress who was standing too close to him. None other than Count Glacia.</p>
<p>Perhaps Alexcent sensed her presence or the murmurs and whispers got to him, because he turned and looked at her walking to him, completely bewitched. His red eyes met her green ones and he swore out loud.</p>
<p>“What is the meaning of this?” he asked.</p>
<p>Amethyst stopped just a few paces from him, ignoring his question. Her face was covered in a mask but everything else marked her. His shirt, his vest, his badge. It sent a message to everyone on who she was. Nothing could be clearer than this. It was a message, a statement.</p>
<p>Gen was glad to see her. He had been ardently albeit politely trying to fend off those crowding around Alexcent. And he was failing but now that she was here, everyone only had eyes for her. She did half his work without even lifting a finger. Gen was grateful.</p>
<p>Amethyst took a step forward. She stood and looked at Alexcent, eye to eye. Then she took a dramatic bow, one hand behind her back and another offered to Alexcent.</p>
<p>“Good evening,” she said, “I am just a fella passing by. May I have the honor of this dance with you, my beautiful lady?”</p>
<p>There was no way in hell that he didn’t recognize her. But with Alexcent, you never knew what he would do. Her heart started thumping against her chest. She looked up and met his eye. His red eyes looked at her questioningly… suspiciously.</p>
<p>Those around him wondered how he would respond to being called a ‘beautiful lady’. Alexcent wasn’t much known for politeness and patience.</p>
<p>“Alright,” he declared and placed his glass on a tray.</p>
<p>“Thank you!” said Amethyst, chuckling. Alexcent accepted her hand and she led him to the center which served the purpose of the dance floor. Eyes turned towards the pair heading there.</p>
<p>When they reached the center, Amethyst placed her hands on his waist and pulled him towards her. She led the dance and Alexcent obliged. Everyone was stunned and watched in awe as the pair danced.</p>
<p>“I wonder what you are up to,” whispered Alexcent in her ear.</p>
<p>“I am not ‘up to’ anything,” said Amethyst. “I just want to enjoy the ball.”</p>
<p>Alexcent wrapped his hands around her waist and dipped her into a dive. “I highly doubt that,” he said as he helped her upright again. He then raised her and swung her in an arch and set her down again.</p>
<p>“Really!” she said with a smirk, “I never do anything out of line.”</p>
<p>Alexcent burst out laughing at that. “Fine,” said Amethyst, “If you insist, I will tell you. I want something.”</p>
<p>“Anything,” he declared.</p>
<p>“I want to be invited to the hunting match,” she said as Alexcent twirled her around. He made a turn and faced him again. “Don’t cut me off again, I—”</p>
<p>Alexcent grabbed her by the waist and raised her up into the air. “Alec!” she said, “Let me down!”</p>
<p>“You called me a ‘beautiful lady’,” he said, “Let me show you my beauty.”</p>
<p>“Alec!” she said, “Are you really going to keep being this stubborn?’</p>
<p>“Maybe?” he said with a smirk, looking up at her.</p>
<p>“Alec!” she glared at him. He let her down on the floor. She stomped her booted foot on his toe.</p>
<p>“Ow!” he cried.</p>
<p>“Oh, my” twirled Amethyst, “I seem to be not very well-versed in dancing.”</p>
<p>Amethyst stuck out her tongue. He pulled her to him, and they swayed in rhythm to the music. He held her so tightly that she felt nearly suffocated. The dance looked more like a fight as people watched dazedly. Amethyst tried to push him, but he wasn’t letting go. So, she kneed him between his legs.</p>
<p>“Agh!” cried Alexcent as he let go.</p>
<p>Amethyst escaped his arms and maintained a distance. “I thought I was going to be suffocated to death!”</p>
<p>Alexcent laughed. “Come on, Ash,” he said, “I would never kill you. Did you really have to knee me there?”</p>
<p>He pulled her in, and she obliged. She leaned on his chest as they swayed to the music. “So, let me go to the hunting match.”</p>
<p>He stiffened. People were just a little far away to hear their whispered conversation, but they were in awe of Amethyst. Thus, went their comments:</p>
<p>“Really,” said a lady, “Lady Skad truly is amazing.”</p>
<p>“Yes!” said the other, “The ball was never this much fun before.”</p>
<p>“I am sure a masked ball was her idea.”</p>
<p>“I like how we are all practically strangers here because we can’t really be sure who is behind the mask.”</p>
<p>“Did you see the duke laughing?” said yet another, “I don’t think I have ever seen him laugh like that!”</p>
<p>“Lady Skad can truly achieve impossible feats.”</p>
<p>Compliments flowed generously from everyone except the lady in the red dress, who was unable to join them in allocating praise so freely. She couldn’t even smile.</p>
<p>“No,” whispered Alexcent. His tone of voice was final, inviting no arguments.</p>
<p>“Really?’ asked Amethyst looking up from his chest. She made the most pitiful face.</p>
<p>Alexcent sighed. “Really,” he said firmly.</p>
<p><em>Is he a wall or something? He never seems to budge. </em>Amethyst sighed in defeat. She backed away a few paces and created a little bit of distance between them. They looked at each other, neither one wanting to budge. None willing to change their minds.</p>
<p>Amethyst took his hand gallantly and placed a kiss at the back. “Hope you have a wonderful evening, My Lady,” she said. Then she turned around and left the ballroom.</p>
