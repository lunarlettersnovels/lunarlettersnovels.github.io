            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 32 – The Big Day (1)</strong></p>
<p>Slowly, he leaned down and gently pressed his lips to hers, water dripped down his hair and onto her forehead. She raised her hand to run it through his damp hair, brushing it back from his face, and drawing him closer. As the kiss deepened, they both let out a moan.</p>
<p>His arm supported them against the door, as he pushed her against it. Even as he breathed heavily, he didn’t let her go, pulling her even closer than before. His mind was filled with thoughts of them entwined for the whole night.</p>
<p>At the sound of the approaching footsteps, he reluctantly broke off their kiss but couldn’t tear his gaze from her. Amethyst was breathing heavily, her cheeks flushed a deep red. He observed as the lust-induced haze lifted from her eyes, replaced by a cold glint. Without as much as a ‘good night,’ she turned around and disappeared into her room.</p>
<p>She was running away embarrassed by a mere kiss. <em>Was she naïve or acting naïve? </em>There was no doubt she was attractive.</p>
<p>His eyes shone with a mischievous glint, a satisfied smile graced his lips as Alexcent left for his own bedroom.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>As soon as she entered her room, Amethyst hurriedly shut the door and leaned against it. Her heart was pounding like crazy, her breathing shallow.</p>
<p><em>‘What was that?!’</em></p>
<p>She had tried to be careful, but he was relentlessly charming and so damn attractive. He was like a spider’s web; the more you tried to get out, the more you got stuck. She fanned her flushed cheeks with her hands and tried to calm her throbbing heart.</p>
<p>He was a man that enchanted people, a man she mustn’t let herself fall.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of Amethyst’s growing anxiety, her wedding day had arrived. Why didn’t the earth just stop moving till she prepared herself?</p>
<p>Since the early hours of the morning, she had started getting ready for the big day with the help of the maids. She looked at her reflection and couldn’t believe it was actually her. She did look like a prince’s bride.</p>
<p><em>The clothes might have played an important role in that,</em> she told herself.</p>
<p>She wore the dress that she had picked with Alexcent and a long veil that covered her face. Due to her obstructed vision, she was assisted by her maids to enter the garden that was decorated for the wedding.</p>
<p>It was a perfect wedding.</p>
<p>Everything was just as she had dreamed of, like a scene from a movie. As she had wished, wisteria trees formed a tunnel for her to walk through, and the lilac petals showered down every time the wind blew, making it a spectacle to see. Bouquets of pastel hydrangeas on every table made it even more glamorous.</p>
<p>Alexcent wore a black suit that usually made him appear cold and difficult for anyone to approach. But today, when she saw him at the venue, he just looked handsome and gentlemanly. It was probably because he was smiling at her. His black suit highlighted his platinum hair. His scarlet eyes held determination and resolve, which was more than she could say for herself because she was shaking in her boots.</p>
<p><em>‘Why am I so nervous? It’s not even my first wedding, or even a real wedding.’</em></p>
<p>Amethyst couldn’t help but feel grateful that her veil was covering her face. Otherwise, her flushed and tense face would have been exposed.</p>
<p>“Look at you! You <em>do</em> look as beautiful as Cinderella, or better yet as Princess Pyeonggang.”</p>
<p>“Alec!” She whisper-shouted at him for his teasing. Even on a day like this, he was teasing her. But thankfully it had helped to calm down.</p>
<p>Alexcent suppressed a laugh and offered her his hand, which she gladly accepted.</p>
<p>The two started walking towards the temple where their marriage would be blessed. To their left were Empress Belice and Duke Roden, and to the right was her family. Besides them, only a few close relatives of the Lohikins were present, making the wedding hall appear spacious. Many noble families and relatives of the Skad Household were waiting in a separately arranged estate for the after-party to celebrate the new couple.</p>
<p>As per Amethyst’s standards, it was a grand wedding, but as per Alexcent’s it was a small wedding. Despite the many weeks of preparation and hard work, the ceremony quickly came to an end. The priest officiated the marriage vows, and they recited the marriage vows kneeling, then signed their names on the marriage document. Finally, Alexcent lifted her veil and kissed her chastely.</p>
<p>With that, the wedding came to an end. For Alexcent, who hated long boring weddings, it was a relief.</p>
<p>Up next was the after-party. All eyes were focused on the newly wedded bride and groom. The highlight of the party was, of course, the dance led by the couple. Everyone who had been invited was unable to hide their excitement. They would finally be able to see the famous Prince Skad and his dancing skills. Even <em>he</em> would not be able to avoid dancing with his new bride.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Amethyst was tense for the very reason. She pulled his sleeve and whispered quietly.</p>
<p>“Alexcent, I-” She cleared her throat to control the tremor in her voice. “I don’t know how to dance. What should we do? I’m scared I’ll ruin everything.”</p>
<p>She looked like she was about to cry. Alexcent kissed her on her cheeks and whispered back to her.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. All you have to do is look into my eyes and follow my lead.”</p>
