            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 49</strong></p>
<p>“Mm, that is, just somewhere— ”</p>
<p>“Where, Madam?” She reiterated.</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>Seeing Amethyst’s reluctance to divulge, Lunia was piqued and she badgered on. “Madam? You lay all your work on me and now where are you headed?”</p>
<p>“Well, I just wanted to check on the dormitory of the maids who work in the side mansion.”</p>
<p>Surprised by the unexpected reply, Lunia asked, “Why do you want to go there?”</p>
<p>“I just have something to enquire…”</p>
<p>“Then let me escort you. I will guide you there.” This was the only way to quell her curiosity she reckoned.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you busy Lunia?”</p>
<p>“No. Today I am not.”</p>
<p>“Then okay. Let’s go together. But please keep it a secret.” Amethyst promptly requested.</p>
<p>“A secret?” Lunia was puzzled.</p>
<p>“Yes. I just want to enquire something discreetly.”</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>Lunia was amused by how her mistress was acting all mysterious. She couldn’t help the smile on her face and soon the two broke into a hearty laugh and were on their way.</p>
<p>Amethyst was able to carry out this secret mission as she had always enjoyed being alone. Her maids did not pester her unless she seeked them out, and they must have gotten used to her as they no longer followed her around and stood guard. So she was able to roam around more freely than she could back home in the count’s house. As such, she enjoyed taking strolls wherever she pleased.</p>
<p>Back at the count’s, Yellie had followed her like a shadow and pestered incessantly. This was one of the reasons she had left her behind. She had Lunia with her now.</p>
<p>At the moment, she was able to exit the main mansion unnoticed and head towards the side mansion.</p>
<p>“Madam, it’s here.”</p>
<p><em>Oh, my godness!</em></p>
<p>The other building that was far off from the main mansion looked like a haunted house. Lunia too seemed surprised, but carefully opened the door for her. For the first time, Amethyst felt relieved to have been in someone’s company as she entered the building.</p>
<p>Once inside, she met a few maids who were resting.</p>
<p>“My goodness! Madam?! What brings you to a place like this…!”</p>
<p>“I hope I am not disturbing your rest?” Amethyst said with a smile.</p>
<p>“What?! Oh no, not all!”</p>
<p>The maids quickly stood up and bowed. “What brings you all the way here Madam?”</p>
<p>“May I take a look around?”</p>
<p>The maids seemed taken aback by her question.</p>
<p>“It will only be a while.” Amethyst added, noticing their hesitation.</p>
<p>“You need not ask for our permission Madam.” The maids bowed in response to Lunia’s words.</p>
<p>“Even so— ”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam. Please don’t mind us and take your time to look around,” One of the maids hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“All right then thank you, please pardon my intrusion.” Amethyst gestured to the maids who were still bowing to stand comfortably and took a look around.</p>
<p>The wallpapers were tearing off the wall and smudged. There were several cracks where wind was blowing in from making the entire building cold. The furniture being used by the maids were either broken or damaged, nothing was whole. It was a much poorer environment than she had imagined.</p>
<p>Amethyst’s expression hardened.</p>
<p>“May I open the drawer?”</p>
<p>One of the maids nodded.</p>
<p>Amethyst was able to open the drawer albeit with Lunia’s help. She found clothes that appeared to be their uniforms but even these were not in a good state. They were full of patchwork and yellow stained sleeves. In her past life, she had washed and ironed collared shirts every day, so she was well aware of how old these clothes must have been to be this way. She couldn’t help but sigh out loud.</p>
<p>She left the creaking drawer behind and looked around at the bedroom. A deep frown etched her face. She looked around before approaching the maids again.</p>
<p>“Let me see your hands,” said she.</p>
<p>“Sorry?” The maid was dumbfounded by the request.</p>
<p>“Quickly.”</p>
<p>At her words, the maid wasted no time and held her hands up while awash with embarrassment.</p>
<p>As expected, even this maid’s hands were covered in scars.<em> What was going on?! Was the work in the mansion this rough and hard? It couldn’t be … If so then the state of the maids in the main mansion should have been similar.</em></p>
<p><em>‘Everything from here to there … no, in fact, send everything to the mansion. Including the ones that my wife is holding.’</em></p>
<p>Momentarily, Alexcent’s words popped up in her head. Thinking back to his behaviour in Newhenfiled, he was not someone who would let something like this be. This only meant neither Pon nor Alexcent was aware of this.</p>
<p><em>So, is Dajal the root cause of the problem?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst turned her gaze back to the maids.</p>
<p>Lunia too must have been surprised by the state of their living quarters as she questioned aloud. “What happened here?”</p>
<p>“— ”</p>
<p>“From what I know, I believe the cost for maintenance, utilities, accommodation is paid every month…so why!”</p>
<p>“Every month?” Amethyst raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam. On the first day of every month, from what I know, they are sent the money for maintenance, the upkeep and accommodation of the maids, and other miscellaneous things they may need.”</p>
<p>At Lunia’s words, Amethyst turned to look at the maids. The maids whose eyes met with the lady of the house could only look down and keep silent.</p>
<p>Then the youngest looking maid braved it. “— We weren’t even aware that there was money sent every month.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
