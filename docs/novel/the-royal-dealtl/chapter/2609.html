        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 64</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst was raging mad at the man in front of her and, more importantly, at herself. She tried her best but didn’t have the strength to handle Dajal’s strong, healthy body in her debilitating condition. She now realized how weak she really was… And how dangerous a situation she had fallen into.</p>
<p>No one was around. No one could save her.</p>
<p>She was only able to guess what other nauseating things he’d do to her in the future, and that stimulated the fear within even more. What she had seen on the news was happening to her right this moment. Her fingertips were shaking, and she could barely breathe. Tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>Dajal, who was staring at the woman frozen with fear in front of him, was approaching closely with a licentious, sinister smile. Stuck in a corner, Amethyst was a sitting duck with nowhere to go. She got goosebumps looking at his face drawing closer and closer.</p>
<p><em>Scary man!!!</em></p>
<p>At the sight of an Amethyst trapped without an escape route and helpless, Dajal stuck out his tongue, looking like a snake that just found its prey.</p>
<p><em>Slither, slither…</em></p>
<p>She felt disgusted. She turned her head to avoid his eyes, but the man grabbed her jaw again and uttered, “Now it’s time to get a taste of you. I have to punish you for making me move around so much like this. What’ll be good, eh? What do you like?”</p>
<p>For a moment, things that would happen next unfolded in her head: Blue and yellow bruises on her shoulders, wrists, forearms, and abdomen; deep, red flesh seen under her torn collar that dyed the maid’s black robe a thick red.</p>
<p><em>Dammit!</em></p>
<p>She nearly came close to fainting.</p>
<p><em>No, get your head together!</em></p>
<p>“I’m begging you… Someone, please help me! Argghh!!”</p>
<p>“It’s not bad being stuck in a body that’s as limp as a corpse.”</p>
<p>During Amethyst’s last-ditch effort, Dajal put more strength in his grip and slid his tongue up her cheek. As her breathing tightened, pale veins popped out and her face turned bright yellow.</p>
<p>At this rate, she’d lose consciousness soon. <em>No…!</em></p>
<p><em>Scream! Scream out- save me!</em></p>
<p>“Sa-sa… save me!!”</p>
<p>After the scream, her hand which had been scratching at Dajal’s hand gripping her chin fell. The frustration of being unable to breathe and the fear of what was to come distracted her. Her red eyes with the small veins soon hid behind her eyelids.</p>
<p><em>Oh, Alec!</em></p>
<p><em>Will his face cross my mind…</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Bang!</strong></em></p>
<p>Suddenly,  the door broke open with a roaring sound. Two armed men dressed in all-gray burst through in an instant; one of them pointed a knife tip at Dajal’s neck.</p>
<p>A red blood drop formed at the blade tip resting on the creep’s neck.</p>
<p>“Take your hands off the lady!”</p>
<p>“Wh-what?!! What does that… Ugh!” Dajal tried to speak.</p>
<p>The knife was pressed harder on his neck, blood flowed down to the handle. He slowly took his hands off of the girl, raising them both in the air.</p>
<p>Amethyst then fell to the ground gasping for air. When her strangled voice finally cleared up, she gasped and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>The other armed man helped her up and asked, “Are you all right, Madam?”</p>
<p>“Ha! Do I look like I’m all right right now?”</p>
<p>“N-n-no, Madam. We apologize for the delay.”</p>
<p>Dajal had no idea what was going on right now.</p>
<p><em>How could she, who was nothing but a maid… be a duchess?? Even worse, a duchess pretending to be a maid???</em></p>
<p><em>F*ck! I’m f*cked now! Rotten b*tch! How could that sneaky b*tch do this!?’ </em>Dajal frantically searched around for a way to escape.</p>
<p>Amethyst, rubbing her stinging throat, took a deep breath and asked, “I’m all right now. But the important thing is… who are you two?”</p>
<p>“We are the bodyguards here to protect you, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Protect me?!” Amethyst was taken aback.</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>“Since when?”</p>
<p>“Since the moment you first arrived at the duke’s mansion, Madam.”</p>
<p><em>Damn… She didn’t even know that. How could knights be protecting her without her knowing? </em>Without having to think twice over it, she already knew who had taken such measures. <em>Alec!</em> <em>I thank you for saving me… Thanks to you, I can breathe again!</em></p>
<p>However, she frowned when his face momentarily flashed in her mind.</p>
<p>Not long after, another knight stepped over the pile of wood left by the broken door and said, “I’ve found Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Both Amethyst and Dajal stiffened up at the knight’s words. Today, one of them was going to be living corpse. No… Well, she hadn’t died at least but wasn’t relieved nonetheless.<br>
Not yet.</p>
<p>She hadn’t found any concrete evidence yet, but she’d try to expose the misdeeds as much as she could. She managed to pull herself together. She was quivering with fear that Dajal still hadn’t left. Even so, this wasn’t the time when she could sit down and cry.</p>
<p>She slowly flattened out the wrinkles on her dress, gathering her strength, and said, “Let’s go, to where His Highness is.”<br>
She put the incident from just now behind her and took a step towards the unknown. She didn’t know what she was thinking when she decided to go to his office. However, when she came to her senses in the end, she was already there.</p>
<p>Alexcent was leaning against a thick mahogany desk in front of her.  He seemed to be emanating a murderous warning to all those in the room. That cold gaze that was threatening to slice down at any moment, made it clear that even a single speck of dust was unacceptable.</p>
<p>Amethyst finally lost it. At this moment, her thoughts were inexplicably away from normal. <em>How could that seething rage, overflowing through every pore of his body, seem so sexy? How the heck can I find this image beautiful…?</em></p>
<p>The man was staring intently at her as if he were going to kill her.</p>
<p>Amethyst, whose hair stood on end as she looked at the man that couldn’t even be approached easily,  fell in love with him without even realizing it. However, she buried that thought the moment she glanced over to the side.</p>
