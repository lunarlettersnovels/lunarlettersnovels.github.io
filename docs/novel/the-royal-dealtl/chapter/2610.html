            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 63</strong></p>
<p>There’s no way that Alexcent, who owned several banks, wouldn’t notice it. This made it clear that there was something going on in Aran Bank.</p>
<p>“It’s not a bad thing that I know.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’re going to have to see~”</p>
<p>She snatched away the ledger that Dajal held in his hand.</p>
<p><em><strong>Flap, flap!</strong></em></p>
<p>She flipped through the pages one at a time.</p>
<p>“Hmmm… I see… This is it.” Amethyst muttered with an intentional strange nuance, she didn’t miss the sweat pouring down Dajal’s forehead.</p>
<p><em>If she were to tell Alec to look at this, how would he react?</em> Looking at the restless and sulking Dajal, she had an impulsive urge but in the end, held it in.</p>
<p>“Looks good. You’ve done a perfect job at managing.”</p>
<p>“Tha-tha-thank you.”</p>
<p>“For what? I ought to thank you for doing such a thorough job.”</p>
<p>“No, not at all! That’s too much.”</p>
<p>He was a dimwit embezzling money. Amethyst couldn’t tell if he was complimenting her or cursing. The shame of distinguishing a person only by appearance; she couldn’t stand that cowering fool.</p>
<p>“If you’re finished, let’s go,” Alexcent said, turning to look at Lunia.</p>
<p>The gaze was so sharp that it made Lunia hold her breath. The prince’s eyes seemed to give off a warning of some sort. With his eyes still on the chamber-maid, he slid his hand around Amethyst’s waist and pulled her in.</p>
<p>When they stepped off into the hallway towards the bedroom, Amethyst insinuated…</p>
<p>“Is the ground in this wing really weak?”</p>
<p>“It seems so.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about the fact that the ground is weak?” she queried.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, just asking… I heard it’s dangerous.”</p>
<p><em>What did he mean by ‘why’? Because he had never seen a building collapse before?</em></p>
<p><em>But if the torn-down place that Dajal mention didn’t exist… Then was this place a rip-off? Was he like this every time?</em></p>
<p><em>If so, Alexcent had trust in him!</em></p>
<p>“You don’t need to worry about a thing. Even though you look at him like that, he’s a useful guy.” Alec broke her train of thought.</p>
<p>“Is that so? If you say so, that’s a relief.” Amethyst just smiled mournfully at him who had said Dajal was useful.</p>
<p>It was clear that he really trusted him. She wondered if he were smiling inside.</p>
<p>Alexcent kissed her temple and said, “By the way, it’s an honor. You coming out to meet me at the door.”</p>
<p>“That’s… only for today!”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⤩</p>
<p>Amethyst was in the middle of cleaning Dajal’s residence today, too. Perhaps Lunia’s lie had slipped through the cracks because the man didn’t ask about yesterday. However, his persistent glare that seemed like he had a goal was unavoidable.</p>
<p>Dajal still sat on the sofa wearing only a gown, looking at Amethyst with a subtle look of desire.</p>
<p><em>Oh… my arm hurts,</em> she thought. <em>The place is clean, so why does he keep telling me to wipe what I’ve already wiped down?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst was constantly moving in Dajal’s dirty, sludgy eyes. He had been continuously watching her, almost surveilling, from when she entered the house. The windows were still firmly shut, and she was sweating from mopping so much; her breathing was getting rougher and arms sorer.</p>
<p>When the uncomfortable sweating and dirty air really pissed her off, she unknowingly let out a groan,</p>
<p>“Uggghhhhh…!”</p>
<p><em>Dammit! I need to be more careful. He might hear me.</em></p>
<p>While mopping, she carefully went in Dajal’s direction, but when she turned slightly to look, he was gone.</p>
<p><em>Where did he go?!!</em></p>
<p>At that moment, a dark shadow appeared in front of her.</p>
<p><em>Shit! How did that happen?</em></p>
<p>“Oh, it must be pretty hot. Your face is flushed like you’ve worked yourself up.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m okay.”</p>
<p>“Your clothes are looking a little soggy right now~”</p>
<p>When Dajal’s hand reached the ribbon collar wrapped around her neck, goosebumps spread all over her body.</p>
<p>“It’s al… right.”</p>
<p>“How can you be all right when your face is burning from breathing in this hot air?”</p>
<p>His hand then came above the ribbon and grazed Amethyst’s red cheek.</p>
<p>She lifted her arm to try to pull her arm back, but the shaky arm wouldn’t move.</p>
<p>‘…!’</p>
<p><em>Dammit, that’s it! My arm won’t move. Is this what the bastard has been after this whole time?! Swoop in on me after rendering my arm useless. What now? It’s clear that if I stay here any longer it could get dangerous. Should I run away…?</em></p>
<p>But Dajal’s hand was already heading to her chest.</p>
<p><em>Don’t do that!</em></p>
<p>“This… Please don’t do this.”</p>
<p>“Haha, haha, haha! How can all of you say the same thing over and over again?”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Dajal gripped Amethyst’s chin in his rough hand.</p>
<p>“Aaarrgghh!”</p>
<p>“Listen up. What’s gonna happen if you disobey me? You saw it, too!! Also, this place is kind of secluded, so no matter how much you scream no one’s gonna hear you.”</p>
<p>He pulled Amethyst’s face closer as he puckered his lips. With all her might, she wrested herself, barely managing to break away from his grip. Then, she ran as fast as she could to the entrance, grabbed the door handle, and shook it frantically. But the door wouldn’t budge… somehow it was locked tightly and wouldn’t open.</p>
<p>Dajal just stood there staring, amused.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee, that’s useless. Well, hello there! You’re cute when you’re all up in a fuss.”</p>
<p>“~ You’re crazy!”</p>
<p>“Whoa, that’s quite a foul mouth you got there. That turns me on even more. But there’s no next time.” He sniggered.</p>
<p>Amethyst hurriedly scurried toward the window. She was about to open it and scream out loudly… but when she grabbed it, all it did was wiggle and rattle; just like the door, it was somehow locked. And when she went to check the window sill, she was shocked to find nail after nail after nail hammered in.</p>
<p><em>I was too complacent.</em></p>
<p>Now she had no choice but to wait for someone to come here to find her, the duchess.</p>
<p><em>But who the hell would come all the way here looking for her? A duchess who enjoyed just being alone…</em></p>
<p>But still, she had to buy herself some time… At least until Alec returned to the mansion.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! Isn’t it time for you to give up now? You’re running my patience.”</p>
<p>“Fuck off! See what happens when you lay a hand on me again.”</p>
<p>“I said I liked you; that doesn’t give you the right to talk to me so recklessly. I said I’d let it slide only once. Now you’re pissing me off.”</p>
