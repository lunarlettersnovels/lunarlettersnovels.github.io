            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 82</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst was so determined that she had went to the knights’ training field. She had promised herself that she wanted to learn to wield a sword, and she would do it. She needed to learn to defend herself after what had happened in the past. She found Hill a little further away from the knights who were training. He was taking a break.</p>
<p>“Sir Hill,” she said happily, “How have you been? I have been looking for you all over.”</p>
<p>“Madam,” acknowledged Hill. “I am very well, thank you. How may I be of help?”</p>
<p>“I want to learn to wield a sword,” she said eagerly, “I was hoping you could teach me.”</p>
<p>Hill looked at her, shocked. “What?!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I mean, I thought I should learn to defend myself,” she continued, “Seeing what happened that time. And who would be best suited for the job than you?” She added hesitantly, with a mock smile.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t that what you brought upon yourself?” asked Hill. She was surprised at the retort. Hill was always so polite. But it was true, if she had thought things through and not rushed like she did, things would have ended differently.</p>
<p>“All the more reason to learn then,” said Amethyst enthusiastically. “I should learn to protect myself in any case.”</p>
<p>Hill’s stare was intense and she tried not to flinch. “You only need to do one thing for protection, my lady,” he said firmly, “Repeat after me.”</p>
<p>“What?” she asked, confused.</p>
<p>“’Save me’, that’s all you have to say,” said Hill.</p>
<p>“Save me?” she asked, confused more than before. <em>Was he mocking her?</em></p>
<p>The knights who had saved Amethyst before now circled her. Some of them who had been training appeared near her, hands on their swords. Others just stared at what was happening. Amethyst was wide-eyed.</p>
<p>“Do you see?” asked Hill, “You just need to utter those words. These knights will always be near you, out of sight.”</p>
<p>“But what if I can’t speak?” she argued.</p>
<p>Hill extended a hand lightning fast and grabbed her wrist. The space was cacophonous with the sound of sword being drawn from their sheath. The knights in grey glared at Hill, their sword inches from his chest. Hill let go of her hand and took a step back.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to worry, my lady,” said Hill, “They would have run me through, had they not known me. If I meant any harm to you, my head would be rolling on the floor and I would be dead. The Master has already taken all precautions for your safety.”</p>
<p>Amethyst really wanted to learn. Perhaps she had this protection now, since she was a Duchess. But she needed to learn in order to protect herself when she was no longer here. Besides, it would always be a handy skill and would give her a sense of comfort when faced with danger.</p>
<p>“Then will you teach me if I order you?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Madam,” said Hill, “It doesn’t work that way.”</p>
<p>“Why?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“You are a lady,” he said, “A small wound on you would mean death for us. These men would kill anyone who so much as brushed against you.”</p>
<p>“I will tell them not to,” said Amethyst, “Please.”</p>
<p>Hill looked like he was cornered, not knowing what to respond. He helplessly glanced at the Commander of the First Division, Buer, who was a few steps away to hear their conversation.</p>
<p>Buer stepped forward. “Madam, we do not have a sword suited for your build,” he said, “Using a sword that is unsuitable could harm your wrist.”</p>
<p>“That’s correct!” said Hill, relieved.</p>
<p>“I had one made especially for me,” said Amethyst, “It will be delivered soon. Will you teach me then?”</p>
<p>Buer tried to dissuade her with other reasons, but she would hear none of it. Hill looked defeated.</p>
<p>Alexcent walked towards them, understanding the situation. The knights were reluctant to teach her sword fighting, understandably so, since she was a woman of power only second to the Emperor. If she got hurt, it would mean their deaths.</p>
<p>“Amethyst,” he called.</p>
<p>Amethyst turned around. She beamed at him like he was the best thing she could have asked for at that moment. “Alec!” she said happily, “You came at the perfect time. Can’t you encourage them to teach me how to use a sword? Please! You told me there was nothing I couldn’t do here.”</p>
<p>Alexcent remembered the night she had asked what she could even do in a place like this. He had told her that there was nothing she couldn’t do here, before she had fallen asleep. <em>She meant this? </em>Alexcent thought she would never stop surprising him. He was amused. The knights, though, looked at him pleadingly.</p>
<p>“I will teach you,” he said.</p>
<p>“You?” she narrowed her eyes. “You are always busy with your work. Why can’t you ask any of them to teach me?” The knights shook their heads at Alexcent when she wasn’t looking.</p>
<p>“It alright,” he assured her, “I can spare a few hours to teach you to use a sword.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Her suspicion was gone, only to be replaced by a rapturous smile that seemed like the sun shining through the clouds. Alexcent’s heart thumped.</p>
<p>“It’s a promise,” he said, smiling, “But only if you wake up early in the morning.”</p>
<p>“What?” she said incredulously, “That means you will never teach me.”</p>
<p>“Just don’t stay too late at night,” he said laughing, “You will be alright.”</p>
<p>“And whose fault is that?” said Amethyst, blushing. She turned to the knights. “Thank you, that will be all.”</p>
<p>Amethyst walked with him away from the training area. She thought she heard the knights’ relieved sighs as she walked away.</p>
