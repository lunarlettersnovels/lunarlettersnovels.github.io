<p><strong>Chapter 255</strong></p>
<p>They wandered through the market stall, taking in all of the crafts, flower displays, and food vendors. In one spot, a crowd had gathered to listen to a singer. Amethyst and Alexcent enjoyed the music for a few moments then continued on to the fountain in the middle of the downtown square. Even here, a show was happening with jets of water shooting into the air in an incredible display of timing. They produced shimmering rainbows that fascinated Amethyst. She turned to Alexcent, to exclaim her enjoyment, and realized he had disappeared. She was so engrossed with the display; she hadn’t even seen him leave. Scanning the crowd, she eventually spotted him coming through the people. He had an item concealed behind his back.</p>
<p>As he approached, she asked, “Where did you go? You should have at least told me you were going somewhere!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if I caused you panic.”</p>
<p>“What if you got lost! You are such a handful.” Amethyst realized once again that she was scolding him like a child.</p>
<p>Alexcent smiled and handed her a bouquet of flowers. Amethyst took hold of them, breathing in the sweet scent.</p>
<p>“I saw you admiring them.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Amethyst said, smiling.</p>
<p>“Do you like them?”</p>
<p>“What? Of course. Who doesn’t like flowers?” Alexcent seemed satisfied. “Next time tell me when you’re going somewhere. Shall we head back now? The delivery should be arriving soon</p>
<p>Alexcent led Amethyst back to the carriage, satisfied that his present went over well.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As Amethyst unpacked her deliveries, she looked up to see a beautiful sunset painting the sky with pinks and reds. It was certainly a more pleasant view than the grey clouds that had covered the heavens yesterday.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop for a little bit,” Amethyst told Alexcent.</p>
<p>“If you’re tired, I can finish up,” he mentioned</p>
<p>“No. I just thought we could watch the sunset. The sky is so pretty. Isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It sure is,” Alexcent agreed.</p>
<p>Amethyst grabbed a couple of cups and a pitcher of tea from behind the counter. “Can you bring two chairs out to the terrace?” she asked Alexcent.</p>
<p>Amethyst followed Alexcent outside and set the tea down on a small table as he set up the chairs. They sat down and Amethyst poured the tea, handing a cup to Alexcent.</p>
<p>The river twinkled like jewels under the rainbow sky. Yellows and purples mixed with the reds and pinks over the mountain tops. They sat for some time in silence, enjoying the view.</p>
<p>Amethyst suddenly said, “I never had time to look up and enjoy the beauty of nature before.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Alexcent wasn’t sure what she meant.</p>
<p>“I mean in the world I lived in before.”</p>
<p>Alexcent looked up in surprise. Maybe she shouldn’t have mentioned another world. She didn’t know why, but at the moment she didn’t want to lie anymore.</p>
<p>“You mean the place you lived in before?” Alexcent said, correcting her.</p>
<p>“Umm…sure, same thing.”</p>
<p>“What was it like?” Alexcent was wondering if she was going to tell him about the time that they were together. He wanted to know what she still thought of the Alexcent she used to know. After all, she had run away just as he confessed his love.</p>
<p>“It was hell.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?” Alexcent had not suspected that answer.</p>
<p>“No, that’s not it. What I meant was I think I was always lonely.” Alexcent clenched his fists as Amethyst continued. “I think I always felt pathetic, so I couldn’t love myself. I didn’t know how important I was. That might be why I clung onto love of other people. I wanted to be loved by my parents, to be a good daughter, so I lived according to my parents’ will, rather than mine.”</p>
<p>Alexcent began to relax. He realized she wasn’t speaking of her time with him. He could understand her position. He had wanted to be loved by the previous emperor.</p>
<p>Amethyst continued. “I did what my parents told me to do and didn’t do what they didn’t want me to do. But nothing changed when I got older. I didn’t want to be disliked, so I did what everyone else expected me to do. I went to school, got a job, and married.”</p>
<p>Alexcent perked up at the word marriage. Was she about to discuss him? “How was your married life?” he asked.</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed. “Honestly, I’m not sure. I married not knowing anything. My husband was indifferent about me.”</p>
<p>Alexcent’s throat seized. “In what regards?” he asked, unsure if he wanted to hear the answer.</p>
<p>“In almost every matter.” Amethyst said.</p>
<p><em>That’s not true</em>, Alexcent thought. <em>I was indifferent in certain matters, but not all of them</em>. He lowered his head in guilt.</p>
<p>Amethyst looked at him, confused by his disappointed face, but continued. “I had a child.”</p>
<p><em>Wait, what? A child? We never had a child.</em> Now Alexcent was completely confused. There had never been a period long enough where she could have had a child without him knowing. Not unless it was before their life together. Alexcent realized that the story she was reciting was not about him. He listened intently to what she was saying, hoping to learn more about her.</p>
<p>“So, I always felt frustrated. Always agitated and lonely. I was always thinking about the pain when I looked at the children. Thinking I might not be a good mom. That they were going to suffer because they were born to me. I was scared. I realized later that the fear only had to do with me, that I might not be myself anymore. That I would live as someone’s daughter, someone’s wife, and someone’s mother, instead of myself. I think I was afraid I’d only be remembered by those labels.” Amethyst paused. “To be honest, I’m not sure anymore.”</p>
<p>Amethyst smiled before she revealed the next part. He would probably think she was insane. But, for once, she needed to let it all out. “I know you won’t believe me, but I come from another world. I don’t know how I came to be here. I don’t know if there’s a purpose for me being here at all, but I do know that this world is not my home.”</p>
