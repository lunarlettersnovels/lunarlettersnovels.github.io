            <p><strong>Chapter 290</strong></p>
<p>Belice rejected all of Michen’s requests to meet, after the incident involving the kiss. Michen was getting frustrated, being told day after day that her schedule was full. He decided to wait outside of her office for when the parliament session let out. It was there that he met Alexcent, exiting the room.</p>
<p>“Her Highness?” Michen asked.</p>
<p>Alexcent didn’t like Michen’s use of the familiar title but didn’t correct him. Michen, after all, was a man of principle and despite all that had happened, Alexcent happened to like him. He just motioned with his head and said, “She’s inside.”</p>
<p>Michen turned to go into the office and Alexcent grabbed his arm. “What?” Michen asked.</p>
<p>“Is this one of the candidates you suggested?” Alexcent asked, shoving a document into Michen’s face.</p>
<p>“It is. What about it?”</p>
<p>“Her Majesty has decided.”</p>
<p>Michen felt sick to his stomach. He threw off Alexcent’s hand and barged into the office. “Your Highness!” he called, seeing Belice.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I gave you permission to enter. That is extremely rude of you, Michen,” Belice said.</p>
<p>“Your Highness,” Michen greeted her, bowing. He then looked at Karune. “I would like a private meeting with you.”</p>
<p>“I refuse. I have no reason to meet you in private anymore.” Belice turned away from Michen and passed a document she had just signed to Karune. “Please proceed,” she told Karune, who bowed and left.</p>
<p>“Have you chosen?” Michen asked, upset that some servants still remained. He did not want to have this conversation in front of them.</p>
<p>“Chosen what?” Belice asked.</p>
<p>“The Prince Consort. Please, delay the decision,” Michen pleaded.</p>
<p>“Why? Aren’t the candidates you went through, thoroughly vetted?”</p>
<p>“There’s a candidate that I missed.”</p>
<p>“A candidate missing? I don’t care, whoever that is.”</p>
<p>“Even if the candidate is me?” Michen was terrified at what her reaction would be.</p>
<p>Belice looked up; her eyes wide in shock. She quickly dismissed the rest of the servants from the room. and stared at Michen. Michen slowly walked over and stood in front of Belice.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have the chance to tell you the other day, as an urgent matter came up. Though, I thought I had shown you clearly how I felt.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” Belice said, her breath caught in her throat.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll just have to show you again.” Michen leaned his hand on the desk, lowered his body, and kissed Belice. She tried to rise but he was blocking her with his body. Belice had promised herself that she was going give up on him. That she would forget him. But instead, she melted into his embrace as their tongues entwined and their breathing got heavier.</p>
<p>Michen whispered quietly into her ear. “Belice.” She looked into his eyes. “I’m not sending you to anyone else.”</p>
<p>Tears began to well in Belice’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Belice, please.” Michen’s voice was shaking. “Choose me.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Belice whispered. “You already have someone you love.”</p>
<p>“Someone I love?” Michen didn’t know who she was referring too.</p>
<p>“You ran to her after kissing me that day.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my God. Belice, Loyalterre is my sister. My stepsister.”</p>
<p>“What?” Belice felt like she was going to faint.</p>
<p>“She was born a bastard and wasn’t acknowledged by the previous Duke. Soon her status will be restored. I thought Alexcent told you. Well, damn it.” Michen felt like he had been played. “It’s a lie that you’ve chosen someone, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Belice said, smiling slyly. Michen felt he had been wronged, but one look from Belice made his heart melt.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, you’re the only one for me. Please accept my love. Of course, if you don’t, I’ll have no choice but to…” Michen let the thought trail off.</p>
<p>“You’ll have no choice but to what?” Belice asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll just have to get rid of whoever it is.” Michen smiled to show that he was only joking. “I’m not losing you to anyone.”</p>
<p>Belice blushed. “But you’re the leader of the nobles. There hasn’t been a case where the head of the nobles becomes a Prince Consort.”</p>
<p>“Loyalterre has been going to the Skad mansion. I think she is learning from Alexcent. I might be able to pass my title to her eventually, once she is ready.”</p>
<p>“I can wait. I will not let anyone by my side until then.” Belice fell back into his arms.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I can wait,” Michen said, leaning his head against Belice’s shoulder. “I want you to be mine, so that no one else can even consider having you. People say I’m a fair person, but I can’t be fair when it comes to you.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s announce it for now. That you’re mine,” Belice said.</p>
<p>Michen smiled, his body filling with joy. He kissed her again, a kiss sweeter than all the others.</p>
