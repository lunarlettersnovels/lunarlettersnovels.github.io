            <p><strong>Chapter 155</strong></p>
<p>She would take off her shoes and socks and patter bare feet down the cement floor, jumping into puddles. The rain felt so nice and freeing and later she would catch a cold.</p>
<p><em>Mum would always scold me for getting sick, </em>she thought, with a bittersweet smile. The memory was nostalgic. She looked around the garden. It was as empty as the aisles near her home. She liked the silence disturbed only by the pattering of the rain. She felt part of the garden, the earth. The smell of the wet soil and foliage felt wonderful. She closed her eyes, taking it all in.</p>
<p>After a while, she realized that the rain wasn’t hitting her at all. She opened her eyes and found Alexcent by her side. He pulled her closer to him as he shielded her from the rain. He had brought an umbrella with him.</p>
<p>“What are you doing standing about in the rain?” he said, “What if you catch a cold?” Alexcent had left for the palace as he had been delayed by the festival. He seemed to have just gotten back.</p>
<p>“Did you just get back?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I was about to head back…,” said Amethyst, “why did you come out?”</p>
<p>“I heard you left without an umbrella, so I came looking for you.”</p>
<p>“I was just walking back but it rained so suddenly,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“What were you thinking about?” asked Alexcent. “You had a sad smile on your face.”</p>
<p>“Just some memory from when I was young,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>“When you were young?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I’m curious,” said Alexcent, “Tell me everything.”</p>
<p>She smiled. It didn’t seem uncomfortable to share about her childhood with Alexcent. “When I was young,” she began, “On the days it rained like this, I would run around barefoot in the neighborhood.”</p>
<p>“Barefoot?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I liked running barefoot in the rain,” she said, “I would run around and play in the rain. I would be soaked through. My mum would scold me if I caught a cold. I was just reminded of that…”</p>
<p><em>I really sound like a crazy, </em>thought Amethyst after she said it. <em>Maybe I shouldn’t have shared too much.</em></p>
<p>She cautiously looked up at him, gauging his reaction. She was worried what he might think of her.</p>
<p>“Are you saying you want to run barefoot right now?” he asked, amused.</p>
<p>“No!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I guess Countess Lohikin didn’t scold you enough,” he said with a smirk.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Aethyst, confused.</p>
<p>“Seeing how you are getting soaked in the rain even when you are all grown up,” he said, “She didn’t scold you enough. You might catch a cold.” He took her hand in his. “See? Your hands are freezing! We should go back, and you need to eat something warm. That should warm you up.</p>
<p><em>Something warm on a rainy day… </em>Amethyst realized something at his words and grabbed his hands. “You’re right!” said Amethyst, “Alec, let’s go and cook something warm and yummy.”</p>
<p>“Of course.” said Alexcent and followed her seeing her so enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Walking side by side with Alexcent in the rain made Amethyst feel very warm inside. She felt a sense of peace. Whenever she was with him, nothing else seemed to matter. It felt like the clouds in her mind were finally clearing and her mood brightened. Once they reached the mansion, she headed to the kitchen straight away instead of her bedroom to change. Alexcent followed her.</p>
<p>“May I interrupt for a minute?” she asked the cook and the maids in the kitchen.</p>
<p>“My Lord, My Lady!” exclaimed the staff, “What brings you here?! You should have called us if you needed something.”</p>
<p>“What I need right now is this whole kitchen,” said Amethyst with a warm smile.</p>
<p>“Sorry, My Lady?” asked the cook, confused.</p>
<p>“Are you all very busy at the moment?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Not really.”</p>
<p>“Then is it alright if we borrow the kitchen for a while?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>Alexcent leaned back on the wall. “You should first go back and change,” he nagged, “What if you catch a cold? Why did you come here all wet?”</p>
<p>“You are the one who said we should have something warm,” said Amethyst, “If you are going to stand there and nag at me, go back to your room first.”</p>
<p>Alexcent grumbled at that. Amethyst chuckled. “I need some ingredients,” said Amethyst to the cook, “Where can I find them?”</p>
<p>“Ah, please follow me,” said the cook, “I will show you the pantry.”</p>
<p>Amethyst followed the cook into the pantry which was well-stocked with all kinds of ingredients. She gathered an armful of the ingredients she needed and returned to the kitchen to cook.</p>
<p>“Alec, if you aren’t going to go back,” said Amethyst, “Then go wash your hands and lend me a hand.”</p>
<p>“Madam, please allow us!” exclaimed the staff not able to bear the though of the duke helping out in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed. “It’s perfectly fine,” she said, “We will handle things here. So, please take go and rest for a while. Or you can even leave for a few hours.”</p>
<p>“Sorry?”</p>
<p>“That would be best,” said Amethst, “I know you will be too nervous and fretful and unable to rest with the duke here, right?”</p>
<p>“No, madam!” said the cook.</p>
<p>“Hurry and go!” said Amethyst, “Before the duke stops you!”</p>
<p>“Will you be alright?” asked the cook.</p>
<p>“Of course!” said Amethyst, bidding them farewell.</p>
<p>The cook looked at Alexcent nervously. He gave a brisk nod. The cook must have felt relieved because he visibly relaxed and made his way out of the kitchen. Alexcent then went to the sink to wash his hands.</p>
<p>“If you are done washing hands,” said Amethyst, “Peel the potatoes.” She handed him a bowl of potatoes.</p>
<p>She boiled some water and added some ingredients to make the broth and left it to simmer on the fire. She took some flour, mixed it with water and kneaded it into a dough.</p>
<p><em>On rainy days, warm soup is best, </em>decided Amethyst. <em>I want to make noodles but it’s difficult. </em>She looked over at Alexcent peeling the potatoes with an intense look on his face. She burst out laughing. His hands were so large, and he was struggling to peel the potatoes because it kept slipping from his hands.</p>
<p>“Alec,” she chuckled, “If you are done with the potatoes, come over here and help me with the dough.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” he said.</p>
<p>“Go wash your hands once again,” she instructed.</p>
<p>“Alright,” he said and made his way to the sink.</p>
<p>It was surprising to see how obedient he was in the kitchen. <em>Maybe I should always have conversation with him in the kitchen, </em>mused Amethyst.</p>
