            <p><strong>Chapter 294</strong></p>
<p>An invitation with the Empress’ seal on it arrived for Amethyst. It was an invitation to visit Belice before the annual festival. Lunia accompanied Amethyst as they travelled to the palace. As they pulled up, Amethyst still couldn’t get used to the fanciness of the Bellicean Palace.</p>
<p>“Amethyst!” Belice said, greeting them with a smile at the front door.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty,” Amethyst greeted her friend, as she and Lunia curtseyed.</p>
<p>“Please, don’t be so formal between us,” Belice said, motioning for them to rise. “Come sit. I’ve been waiting for you. Alexcent is quite boring.”</p>
<p>Amethyst laughed. “How are things with you and Duke Roden? Let’s all meet next time. I haven’t seen him since the wedding. I would love to have a chance to get to know him better.”</p>
<p>“We’re well. But there is some concern. Sir Roden received a message not too long ago, from Loyalterre. It’s nothing, overly serious. Duke Roden had planned to give his title over to Loyalterre. That’s why Loyalterre went to study abroad, to become prepared for her duties. But, Loyalterre said in the message that she discovered something else she wants to do. She wants to be an explorer, so she said she won’t be coming back for a while.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice that she discovered what she wants to do with her life,” Amethyst said.</p>
<p>“That’s true. But Michen and Loyalterre are all that are left of the Roden family. If Loyalterre doesn’t succeed as head of the family, then MIchen won’t be able to pass down his title to anyone.”</p>
<p>“Is that a problem?” Amethyst asked. “Is Duke Roden sick?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s not like that. I guess you wouldn’t know. The Prince Consort of the Empress, my husband, can’t be the head of a family.”</p>
<p>“But Duke Roden is the leader of the nobles,” Amethyst pointed out.</p>
<p>“That’s right. So, we have only announced that we’re courting and were waiting until Loyalterre is able to succeed the title to get married. But now that plan has been delayed.” Belice looked troubled.</p>
<p>“What did Alec say?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“Alexcent? As expected, he said to change the law. It’s funny how he wants me to change a law that doesn’t even exist.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean the law doesn’t exist?” Amethyst asked.</p>
<p>“It’s an established tradition. Like an unwritten rule,” Belice explained. “Well, that’s if Duke Roden was a normal master of a family. But he’s the leader of the nobles. There are many enemies who are after his position. There will be a lot of chaos because of this. On a different topic, do you know who Count Zaizen is, by any chance?”</p>
<p>“Count Zaizen? Not at all. Who is that person? How would I know him?” It was certainly a name that Amethyst had never heard before.</p>
<p>“I have no idea, but the man seems to be spreading rumors that you and him were lovers. It’s even circulating in the palace.”</p>
<p>“What?!” Amethyst was so surprised by this news that she didn’t know how to react. <em>Did Amethyst have another lover before I was brought over?</em> she wondered. <em>If she did, what should I do?</em></p>
<p>“Amethyst? Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes…No! I don’t think I had a lover before I came, but now I’m not sure.” <em>Wait!</em> The thoughts were coming fast and furious. <em>If I had a previous lover, why hasn’t he come forward to me when the news of the marriage spread?</em></p>
<p>There was no way that a previous lover would do nothing when the Empire was all excited about the news of her engagement to Alexcent. And, even though it was Alexcent, the man would have at least sent a letter. But there was none of that, and now he was spreading rumours of their supposed tryst.</p>
<p>“It’s not true,” Amethyst said, almost certain.</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Probably. There’s no way I could suddenly have an unknown lover. He didn’t try to contact me at all while I lived in the Count’s place before meeting Alexcent. And Amethyst’s journals had no indication she was seeing someone.”</p>
<p>“I see. Honestly, I didn’t believe it. The only reason why I’m telling you is because if Alexcent knows about this, something will be done.” Belice looked at her with a warning.</p>
<p>Belice rubbed her chin in thought. “…getting rid of the Count very quietly.” It wasn’t even surprising.</p>
<p>“Yes… he definitely would.”</p>
<p>Belice sighed. “I know he is my brother but I don’t really condone this.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, thank you for telling me.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. As an Empress, I can’t let anyone become God’s guardian just because of their big mouth. Even thought I don’t like him; he is still my subject and I have a duty to protect them.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Belice found it strange that Alexcent hadn’t told her anything about it. <em>He probably thought it didn’t concern me.</em></p>
<p>Amethyst’s head was full of thoughts.</p>
<p>“I think we should cut out tea time here.” Belice chuckled.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Your Majesty. Of course.”</p>
<p>“I had a good time. You were great help. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, too.”</p>
<p>“Please visit anytime. You know you are always welcome here.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>After bidding farewell, Amethyst left the drawing room. Lunia waited for her at the front door.</p>
<p>“Lunia.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Madam.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear any rumors about me?”</p>
<p>Lunia hesitated.</p>
<p>“You did.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“That means, there’s no way Alec wouldn’t know about it…”</p>
<p>“He probably knows…”</p>
<p>Amethyst sighed. “I need to go back fast.”</p>
<p>Lunia escorted Amethyst out of the palace and ended up face to face with an unfamiliar man.</p>
<p>“Amethyst!” he called.</p>
<p>The man smiled slyly and stepped closer to Amethyst. “My, you’ve gotten much prettier. I almost walked passed you.”</p>
<p>Lunia unsheathed her sword and pointed it at the man’s throat forcing him to step back. “How dare you be so rude to the Duchess? Step back.”</p>
