            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 91 – Two Rascals</strong></p>
<p>“Well, isn’t today another amazing day…”</p>
<p>“You bet so…”</p>
<p>A few feet away, Leyrian and Buer were hiding from sight, watching Alexcent and Amethyst at their supposed ‘sword practice’.</p>
<p>“By the way, when do you think those two will be over?” Leyrian said as they watched the couple wrapped in each other’s arms.</p>
<p>“Hopefully soon.”</p>
<p>“Not by the looks of it. Shall we make a bet?”</p>
<p>“On what?”</p>
<p>“Whether it will be over soon or not.”</p>
<p>At Leyrian’s words, Buer thought for a moment and said, “Then I bet it won’t end at all.”</p>
<p>“There isn’t an option like that!”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Buer hit Leyrian on the chest with his elbow, jokingly.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Hm…Alec,” she said between kisses. “You should be teaching me.”</p>
<p>Alexcent pulled away. “Tell me,” he said softly, “Why are you so eager to learn swordsmanship and shooting?”</p>
<p>“Because in a year, or maybe a few months, I will no longer be the Duchess,” she said feeling drunk on his kiss that she had said aloud what was only in her thoughts.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” said Alexcent sharply.</p>
<p>His steely voice brought her back to attention. “What do I mean?” said Amethyst, “Alexcent, we are under a contract marriage. When the contract is over, I will no longer be a Duchess. I need to learn to protect myself! I can’t spend my life depending on others for safety.”</p>
<p>“I see,” he said bitterly. Then he went silent. It was true, but truth can be difficult to digest.</p>
<p><em>Well, it’s out in the open now, </em>thought Amethyst, trying to gauge Alexcent’s reaction. He seemed distant and aloof. She had expected this to develop into a scene but seeing Alexcent taking the news so silently unsettled her.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said after a long silence, “That’s it for today’s lesson.” He turned and walked away. Amethyst lifted the sword that had fallen to the ground.</p>
<p>“Alec!” she called. He turned and their eyes met for a brief moment. “Your sword,” she said holding it forward.</p>
<p>“I told you,” he said in a steely tone, “You can keep it.” He then left the field.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Amethyst spent the afternoon resting in her bedroom. She lay down and tried to make herself not think too much on the coldness in Alexcent’s tone when she had told him about her reasons for her eagerness to learn swordsmanship and shooting.</p>
<p>His cold tone of voice pierced at her heart. No matter what she did, it bothered her. Her mind was in a state of disarray. <em>What is up with him? </em>She wondered. Usually, the heroine in the novels moved to the next level when they died or went into another body. She had thought she was trapped in space and would someday be able to go back. She also pondered if she went back, would she appear at the same moment she had disappeared from another world? She wanted to live a free life. She was so sure that it was only a matter of time till she could go back. So, she had agreed to Alexcent’s conditional proposal, despite not wanting to marry. <em>He knows about the one-year deadline, so why does he have to act so bitter?</em></p>
<p>She sighed and traced the embroidery across her blanket. <em>I can’t take this anymore! Maybe if I move a bit, or do something, it will help me calm down. Alec does have a knack for making people nervous and disturbed!</em></p>
<p>She got up from the bed and changed into something comfortable. She picked Alexcent’s sword and headed outside. She walked to the field. She could see that the training was over and only a few knights were loitering in the field.</p>
<p>Leyrian noticed Amethyst walking towards the field with sword in hand. He approached her. “Forgive me, Ma’am, but why are you here at this hour,” he said, “Didn’t the training end this morning?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I am just here to practice what I learnt today,” said Amethyst, then frowned, “Wait, how do you know I was training this morning?”</p>
<p>“Well, I had heard that you always train in the morning with his Lordship,” he said hurriedly. “I, too, train in the mornings.”</p>
<p>But Amethyst saw his nervous reaction and sort of guessed what was happening. “That early?” she asked, narrowing her eyes.</p>
<p>Buer approached her too, sweating after his training. “I see,” she said, “And I would be right in assuming Sir Buer would have been present too?”</p>
<p>They both looked guilty as sin. “Madam,” he said apologetically, “We didn’t mean to peek.”</p>
<p>“Peek?!” asked Amethyst, aghast, “What did you see?</p>
<p>“We are so sorry, Madam,” said Leyrian.</p>
<p>The way they looked, Amethyst could have forgiven them until she noticed Buer elbowing Leyrian on the ribs.</p>
