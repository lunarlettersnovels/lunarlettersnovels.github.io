            <p><strong>Chapter 297</strong></p>
<p>She stamped it and placed a kiss at the front so that the shape of her lips was imprinted at the front. Now, the daunting task of delivering it. She didn’t want to do it herself. It was too embarrassing!</p>
<p>She wished she could dig a hole and bury herself in the ground forever. At last, she gathered her courage and headed to his office. He was always either at the bedroom or his office. She pushed the door quietly and entered. Thankfully, the office was empty.</p>
<p>Her heart pounded. She examined his desk. Finally, she put the letter in between a pile of documents. Her heart raced. She wasn’t doing anything wrong so why was she feeling so nervous? She wiped her sweaty palm on her skirt and left the office.</p>
<p>She hid the rest of the letters in places he usually visited.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Alexcent went to his office late at night. Gen had begged him to sign some urgent documents.  He let out a sigh and sat at his desk. He picked up a pen to sign the document. He had no mood. He placed the pen down an opened the drawers. He took out an envelope.</p>
<p>There were a few envelopes that hadn’t been open. There was one envelope that looked especially old.</p>
<p>He knew.</p>
<p>He knew that those letters had not been written by Amethyst. Not the Amethyst he knew, at least. So, why did he feel like sh*t anyway? He glared at the envelopes.</p>
<p>Alexcent picked up the old and work envelope and took a letter out of it. It was the apology letter that Amethyst had written to him. He carried it with him always. He had read it so many times that the edges of the paper had turned old and brittle. This was the real letter she had wrote to him.</p>
<p>The letter he had and the others had a slight difference in handwriting. At a glance, they looked the same but as he examined it closely, he could see the difference in how Amethyst slanted her ‘T’ and dotted her ‘i’.</p>
<p>Nobody could fake a handwriting to that extent. So, he knew his Amethyst hadn’t written them. Even then, his jealousy remained. He turned his eyes towards the mountain of documents. He picked the topmost and found an envelope nestled between the files.</p>
<p>He was excited. His eyes twinkled. He saw the dried flower at the front and the imprint of her lips.</p>
<p>[Love you always.</p>
<p>Forever yours,<br>
Amethyst]</p>
<p>His felt warmth at this unexpected gift. He tried to calm his fluttering heart. He stood up and left the office. He walked as fast as he could and halted in front of the door to her bedroom. He turned the knob quietly. He saw her sleeping form, shining in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Alexcent walked towards her. She looked so peaceful while she slept. He finally felt peace. He leaned down and placed a kiss on her forehead. “Amethyst,” he whispered. “I love you.”</p>
<p>The moonlight shone on them like a blessing. He noticed that he found several letters after that day. One in the shower booth, another in his dressing room’s cabinet, yet another in his uniform jacket, and a sly one in the carriage he always used. They were like little treasures.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Gen dragged his tired self into the office. He resolved to be done with the documents once and for all. Amethyst had told him not to worry but he worried. He hoped Alexcent had found the letters by now. He couldn’t take it anymore.</p>
<p>“My Lord,” he said as he knocked. He heard no response. He assumed the lord was busy so he carefully opened the door and staggered inside. “My Lord?”</p>
<p>The office was empty. Gen blinked. The documents hadn’t been signed. He saw the pen on the desk, as though someone had lifted it up and placed it down again. He also saw the yellowish envelopes on the desk.</p>
<p>The person who should have signed the documents yesterday night wasn’t here at all. “Just kill me please!” shouted Gen in frustration. He was going to be tortured this way forever.</p>
<p><strong>Extroversion 4. The return of the annual festival</strong></p>
<p>The Empire’s congress ended and the period of annual festival returned. It was the first since the Duchess disappeared two and a half years ago.</p>
<p>Amethyst waited with Alexcent at the front gate for the familiar carriages. She couldn’t hide her excitement.</p>
<p>Count and Countess Onslow were the first to arrive. Amethyst ran forward and embraced Countess Onslow. “Countess Onslow!”</p>
<p>“Oh my, Duchess. It’s been a long time.”</p>
<p>“I really missed you.”</p>
<p>“Me too.” Countess Onslow smiled warmly at her.</p>
<p>Count and Countess Citri were next. Besides, Countess Citri’s belly which had grown in size, the couple were same as ever. They seemed even more fond of each other than before.</p>
<p>Amethyst jumped joyfully. “Countess Citri, congratulations!”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Countess Citri blushed.</p>
<p>“Are you alright? Was the journey difficult in your condition?” asked Amethyst in concern.</p>
<p>“I insisted that we stay behind this time, but she wouldn’t listen! She wanted to see you desperately,” said Count Citri. “We left early so we could take out time and not rush.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Of course! I missed you so much. Also, I am stable for now. So, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Alright. But please promise me that you will take care of yourself.”</p>
<p>“Of course!” Countess Citri stayed by Amethyst side. She was like a loving, elder sister.</p>
<p>After that, Renove couple, Houres couple, and Zephyre couple came out of their respective carriages and greeted Amethyst. Baron Piamon was next. He greeted both Alexcent and Amethyst amiably. He was still single.</p>
<p>Last was Count Glacia. A young man exited the carriage first and escorted Count Glacia out. Everyone was surprised at the sight except Alexcent.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while. Duke Skad, Duchess,” the man greeted them.</p>
