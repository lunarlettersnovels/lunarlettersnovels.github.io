            <p><strong>Chapter 119 – The Dance of Birds (1)</strong></p>
<p>Buer’s words were persuasive. Amethyst found herself wanting to see Count Glacia fight and learn whatever she could manage.</p>
<p>“Then, please accept my request,” said Count Glacia, respectfully.</p>
<p>Alexcent let out a sigh. “Watch carefully,” he said to Amethyst, “It might help you.” Amethyst didn’t know what to say, so she just nodded.</p>
<p>“May I borrow your sword?” asked Alexcent extending a hand to her.</p>
<p>“My sword?” she asked, surprised. “It’s too light. Compared to yours, it’s probably weaker.”</p>
<p>Alexcent leaned down and touched his forehead to hers. Amethyst blushed, aware of the eyes on them. She thought he might kiss her and tried to drive those thoughts away.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” he said, “I won’t break it.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant…,” she said. She wanted to say that the sword was too weak for someone like him so he might get hurt instead for not being able to use his full potential. But she looked up to see him smirking and stopped herself saying anything after that. Alexcent caressed her hair, took the sword from her hands and took his stance.</p>
<p>“Please step this way,” said Leyrian, escorting Amethyst over to the side with the others.</p>
<p>The upcoming match attracted a lot of other knights and they gathered together to watch. Amethyst sat down with them to observe.</p>
<p>Count Glacia bowed respectfully then took her stance. Alexcent simply nodded once.</p>
<p><strong>Clang-!</strong></p>
<p>There was a blur and the sound of the two swords clashing. Buer was right. Count Glacia’s swordsmanship was beautiful. She was very agile and fast. She was practically a blur swinging her sword to thrust and to parry. The sword looked more like a whip in her hand than a blade. The attacks were never ending. Her braided hair flew around her like a tail.</p>
<p>“Watch carefully,” said Leyrian beside her, “Buer might lack in emotional quotient, but he has a very good grasp when assessing fights and swords. It will help you.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” she said.</p>
<p>Leyrian was trying to make small talk to keep her engaged but she could see the focus with which he watched the match. His eyes did not waver from the front, taking in every move. And she could understand why. The two people locked in the duel seemed to be dancing. Alexcent was on the defensive while Count Glacia was playing on the offense.</p>
<p>Amethyst worried a little. She wondered if it was because of her sword that he was reduced to defending himself more than attacking. She clenched her fist in anticipation.</p>
<p>“Maybe the sword is too weak for him,” she murmured.</p>
<p>“I doubt it,” said Leyrian.</p>
<p>“What?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I think he is on the defensive in consideration for you,” he said, “He is showing you Count Glacia’s moves so you can learn. A good swordsman isn’t determined by the type of sword.”</p>
<p>That made sense. <em>I think too much, </em>she thought. The match continued. Count Glacia’s breathing came more rapidly. The pair countered andattacked in sync as though they had done this a million time before. It looked more like a conversation, like a dance but with swords as they lightly floated around one another in perfect combination.</p>
<p>It reminded Amethyst of the mating dance of the birds.</p>
<p>She found herself unable to look away. Before long, they no longer looked like two people fighting but one. They were in perfect sync. Like black and white flowing into one. Inseparable from each other. It was beautiful.</p>
<p>Then an unbidden thought rose in her mind. <em>Maybe this is it. Maybe in the novel, Amethyst is only meant to link these two protagonists together.</em> She was unfamiliar with the original novel, so she didn’t know what function the original Amethyst fulfilled.</p>
<p><em>What if Count Glacia is the female lead? And I am just a tool to make them come together, </em>Amethyst wondered. <em>What if those two are meant to be together and I am just a nuisance, after all? Am I the one getting in their way?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst’s eyes flashed. She saw gold and black light. The sound of the clashing swords rose to a crescendo. Her head felt like it would split, and she felt nauseous and dizzy. Amethyst turned pale. Before she knew, she was running from the field. Someone was calling her from behind, but she ignored it and ran and ran until he reached her bedroom and shut the door loudly. Her breath came is gasps and her eyes burned.</p>
<p>“Madam?” said Lunia in surprise. “Are you alright?” she rushed towards Amethyst. “You look very pale.”</p>
<p>Amethyst grabbed Lunia’s hand to steady herself. She was panting so hard that she was unable to speak.</p>
<p>“Madam?” said Lunia again.</p>
<p>“I…I’m okay,” managed Amethyst, “Just need… a minute.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Lunia and stroked Amethyst’ back, trying to soothe her.</p>
<p>Once she could breathe normally, Amethyst said, “Sorry, I am fine now.”</p>
<p>“That’s a relief,” said Lunia, sitting her down on the bed. “What happened?”</p>
<p>She didn’t know what to tell Lunia and she didn’t want to speak of the things she had thought. “Well, I forgot about the time and I recalled that we needed to go shopping today. So, I ran back.”</p>
<p>“It’s not late at all,” said Lunia, handing her a glass of water. “I think it would be better if we cancel for today.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Amethyst, “Why?”</p>
<p>“You don’t look well,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“I am absolutely fine,” insisted Amethyst, “We can’t cancel now. All the ladies are looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>“Even so, your health is more important,” said Lunia.</p>
<p>“Then I will rest a little,” said Amethyst, “Could you take the ladies? Show them around and help with their shopping?”</p>
<p>“Will you be okay by yourself?” asked Lunia, concerned. “I can stay by your side.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. Roman will be here,” said Amethyst, “Can’t disappoint the ladies.”</p>
<p>Lunia sighed. “Understood,” she said.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Amethyst. “What if they ask about me?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” said Lunia, “I will handle it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much,” said Amethyst.</p>
<p>Roman stumbled into the room with a very shocked expression. “Madam,” said Roman looking terrified, “The duke!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“He is heading this way to your room,” said Roman, visibly pale, “He looks furious!”</p>
