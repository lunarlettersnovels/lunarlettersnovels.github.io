            <p><strong>Chapter 279</strong></p>
<p>Young Lady Raspy quickly spoke up, hoping to change the atmosphere. “To choose just anyone for the princess. Lady Julia, you shouldn’t joke like that.” She laughed nervously.</p>
<p>“Of course, the elegant princess should marry someone that fits her station,” one of the other girls spoke up.</p>
<p>“Yes! Lady Julia must be so worried about the princess. That is why she is giving her advice,” a third girl said.</p>
<p>Everyone was trying their best to stay on Belice’s good side. Belice turned her head and nodded at the young ladies.</p>
<p>“I agree. I’m very thankful that young Lady Julia is looking out for me.” Belice was inwardly upset at Briden’s attitude, but she had no intention of letting Briden ruin her first teatime.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the girls, Harin had escorted the empress outside to join in the festivities. They stopped just behind some bushes to quietly listen in to the conversation. The empress’ face didn’t just become stern, but it looked like she was ready to commit an atrocious crime.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, I’ll immediately evict the young Lady Julia from the grounds.” Harin said, turning to deal with the girl. Caniel stopped him.</p>
<p>“No. We can’t ruin the princess’ teatime.”</p>
<p>“But Your Majesty,” Harin pleaded.</p>
<p>“The moment that young lady leaves the palace grounds, arrest her. My empathy will remain up to that point.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.” Harin bowed.</p>
<p>“You can announce me now,” Caniel ordered.</p>
<p>Harin raised his voice and announced the empress’ arrival. Belice and the other young ladies stood up in surprise and greeted the empress as she joined them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The news of the second daughter of Count Julia being arrested quickly spread through the empire, but in the palace everything was quiet.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Prince Alexcent will soon be arriving in the capital,” Harin reported to Caniel, who was busy working in her office.</p>
<p>“Really? Faster than I thought.” Caniel looked over the report that Harin handed her. “According to this, he annihilated Widburgen. I’m not surprised. He’s just like me.”</p>
<p>Caniel knew her son was strong and merciless, as she was. <em>If only he had been born a girl</em>, she thought. Last night, Belice had come to her chamber begging for forgiveness on behalf of Lady Julia. Caniel’s head hurt from that thought.</p>
<p>“Spare no expense on the victory greeting of the army when they return,” Caniel informed Harin before returning to her work</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty,” Harin replied, bowing deeply and exiting the chamber.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>That afternoon the army, led by Alexcent, arrived at the capital. The citizens lined the streets and cheered at their glorious return.</p>
<p>Alexcent went straight to the empress upon entering the palace, the dust of battle still clinging to his clothes.</p>
<p>“Where is Her Majesty?” Alexcent asked Harin.</p>
<p>“She is in her office,” Harin informed him.</p>
<p>“Please request an audience with her for me immediately.”</p>
<p>“You must be tired from a long journey, you should…”</p>
<p>“Now,” Alexcent demanded with a fury. Harin quickly ran to inform the empress of Alexcent’s request.</p>
<p>Alexcent turned to another servant and gave him an order. “Please send this boy to my chambers. Allow him to have a bath and find him some fresh clothing to wear.”</p>
<p>The servant looked over the boy with dark violet hair. He looked young and a bit shaggy. The servant seemed to be confused about the presence of this strange child, who had returned with the prince from the war, but he wasn’t one to argue so he asked the boy to follow him and led him off to the prince’s chambers.</p>
<p>Alexcent walked down the long hallway to the empress’ office, after Harin returned and said he was welcome to meet with his mother. Alexcent entered the office, bowing and giving the traditional greeting. “Greeting to Her Almighty Majesty. Alexcent Frostin has returned to serve you. Have you been well?”</p>
<p>“Skip the formal greetings.” Caniel said, waving her hand in annoyance. “You have done well on the battlefield.” She was cold and uninviting.</p>
<p>“It was a simple victory,” Alexcent informed her.</p>
<p>“Are you injured?” Caniel asked.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Caniel stood up and put down the document she had been studying. “All right, let’s go for a walk.”</p>
<p>Caniel and Alexcent headed out of the office and out to the gardens of the palace. Caniel remained silent until they were amongst the trees.</p>
<p>“You’ve grown again,” she acknowledged. Alexcent only offered a grunt in response.</p>
<p>The two of them followed the path that headed to the Great Temple, situated at the far end of the gardens. Before they even got near, the power of the World Tree could be felt. Caniel stopped and turned to the servants that had been following.</p>
<p>“Everyone is dismissed,” she commanded.</p>
<p>The servants bowed and headed back to the palace, leaving her and Alexcent alone. Caniel turned to him and caressed his cheek, feeling the warmth of his face. Tenderness was not something she could show in front of others.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you weren’t hurt?” she asked again.</p>
<p>“No,” Alexcent assured her.</p>
<p>“That’s good. I knew you wouldn’t get hurt, but the concerned mind of a mother never disappears.”</p>
<p>Alexcent liked how his mother worried over him, but of course he could never show it. Caniel looked at him and smiled. Then she entwined her arm with his and they continued walking.</p>
<p>“I think it should be all right for you to stop leading the battles in the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Alec would not back down from his duty.</p>
<p>“Even though it wasn’t our Empire, Widburgen is a strong country. If you were able to annihilate that kingdom, the message should be a fair warning to any other countries that oppose us. This is a necessary precaution. Your power is steadily getting stronger, and my power is steadily getting weaker.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that!” Alec said, unable to face the truth.</p>
<p>“You’re still like the little boy I remember. You always hold on to things that are inevitable. You just can’t let go.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty!”</p>
<p>“I told you to call me mother when it is only the two of us.”</p>
<p>“Mother,” Alexcent corrected. Caniel smiled and caressed his hand. They entered the temple and stood in front of the World Tree.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to have someone you have to protect. Also lonely. Even though I know this to be the case, I have a difficult task I must ask of you.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine with whatever you command.”</p>
<p>Caniel sighed at Alexcent’s words. He never developed an opinion of his own.</p>
<p>“You always say you’re fine,” Caniel said. Alexcent lowered his eyes without refuting her.</p>
<p>“Power doesn’t have to come from strength alone.” Caniel tapped her temples and continued. “Sometimes knowledge triumphs over power. Go and learn about politics with Belice.”</p>
<p>“As you wish, mother.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have much time left,” Caniel continued. “Belice lacks the strength to be an empress yet. I only have you to trust. I’m sorry to burden you with such a heavy duty.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I know duty better than anyone.”</p>
<p>Caniel smiled warmly. “My son,” she said, lovingly. Alexcent blushed at her devotion. “Promise me one thing, that you’ll protect Belice. That you’ll give everything you have to keep your sister safe. Can you swear it on the World Tree?”</p>
<p>Alexcent looked at the World Tree, with its white trunk and leaves that shone gold in the sunlight. “I swear on the World Tree. I’ll protect Belice with all my might.”</p>
<p>“Even if Belice does something terrible to you in the far future, always forgive her. She has a kind heart, unlike us.”</p>
<p>“Of course.” The rest of the time they had together, they simply enjoyed the walk through the park.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Belice heard Alexcent come back and quickly went to the prince’s chambers.</p>
<p>“Alexcent!” she shouted happily as she ran into his room. He lay on his bed, resting from his walk in the gardens.</p>
<p>“Hi.” Unlike Belice, who was overjoyed, Alexcent acted like he had been there the whole time.</p>
<p>“That’s all you can say after not seeing each other for almost a year and a half?” Belice said, incredulously.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while,” Alexcent replied, his face remaining stone.</p>
<p>“Alexcent!” Belice glared at him. “Well, it actually would be weird for you to greet me happily.” She laughed and sat down on the bed next to him.</p>
<p>“Did you get hurt?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“It took a while this time,” Belice pointed out.</p>
<p>“Did it?”</p>
<p>“It only took you a year, last time.”</p>
<p>“They did cause me some trouble.”</p>
<p>Belice stretched out her hands, palms up.</p>
<p>“What?” Alexcent asked.</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘what’? Where’s my gift?” Belice demanded.</p>
<p>“Do you think I was on a vacation?” Alexcent asked.</p>
<p>“You always bring back something! Do you really have nothing?”</p>
