            <p><strong>Chapter 106 – It Is Not a Shame (1)</strong></p>
<p>As Alexcent and Amethyst entered the banquet hall, the seated guests rose as one to greet them. The preparation had been made exactly like the previous year, so everything seemed to be going smoothly. The only difference was that Amethyst sat next to Alexcent at the head of the table.</p>
<p>Count Glacia naturally sat on a chair on Alexcent’s other side, followed by Count Citri, Baron Hours and his wife, then Baron Zephry and his wife. On the opposite side, along Amethyst’ side sat Count Onslow, Baroness Renove.</p>
<p>As expected, Count Glacia was decked and bedecked in a beautiful dress and glittering jewels. Her luscious, long hair added to her elegance. Count Glacia knew her strengths. She appeared confident, elegant and in poise.</p>
<p>Amethyst let out a sigh. Her thoughts were interrupted by Alexcent’s voice.</p>
<p>“Thank you all for making the long trip here,” he said, “I hope you have all rested. Even if you haven’t, that is indeed too bad. Let’s begin!”</p>
<p>The guests laughed at his joke and the feast began. The servants served the meal and tended to their respective nobles. Amethyst, who was seeing this for the first time, admired their efficiency.<em> So, this is what nobles enjoy, </em>she thought, <em>it’s like dining in a five-star hotel!</em></p>
<p>The nobles engaged in conversation among themselves and Amethyst directed a glance towards Alexcent. He was keenly focusing on his food, avoiding her gaze. He didn’t seem to be interested in conversations going around him either.</p>
<p>Amethyst rather wished that he would engage her in a conversation, she hardly knew anybody else. They were all his family! And he sat there, determined on his food, and not even acknowledging her. It was as though she was a prop placed on a chair next to him and nothing else.</p>
<p>Amethyst turned her gaze back to her plate in front of her, in which the servant has served an appetizer for her. It was a salad with fresh greens and fruits. Amethyst sighed and pushed the plate to the side. It was an indication to the servant to remove the plate.</p>
<p>“Eat it,” said a low voice from beside her.</p>
<p>She turned to see Alexcent with his hand on his chin. He pushed the plate in front of her. He knew she disliked the dish and yet… Amethyst scowled. She couldn’t refuse and make a scene here, in front of all the guests. <em>He had been ignoring me fine till now, </em>she thought vehemently, <em>it seems he doesn’t want to pass a chance of making me miserable today.</em></p>
<p>She played around with the fork and poked at a fruit and placed it in her mouth. Since yesterday, she had only gotten cold shoulder from him. And today, she gets only two curt words ‘let’s go’ and ‘eat it’ respectively. <em>How annoying.</em> <em>He doesn’t want to speak to me and yet he wants to order me around! </em>She felt her anger flare. <em>Ignoring me when it is convenient to him, ordering me when it suits him! </em>She put the fork down and pushed the plate aside.</p>
<p>She didn’t look at him, only looked forward. She felt his gaze on her, but she ignored him and pretended to be interested in the conversation of the other nobles. And unlike his stupid aloof countenance, she didn’t forget to smile at her guests sweetly.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Count Citri. You recently succeeded in the title.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. After my father abdicated, I was surprised to succeed to it.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, what do you mean surprised. We are all well aware of your great business talent.”</p>
<p>“I am flattered, Baroness Hours.”</p>
<p>“Oh how humble.”</p>
<p>Countess Onslow looked at Countess Citri as she continued.</p>
<p>“You must be under quite a pressure, having become a Countess at such a young age. Count Citris’ business is of a rather large scale.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Really it was so sudden….I seek your guidance Countess Maria. I have a lot to learn.”</p>
<p>“Please, any time. I will help you to the best of my abilities.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your kind words.”</p>
<p>Count Glacia who had been listening in added on.</p>
<p>“Well talking about pressure, I doubt if anyone can match up to her Ladyship? So please don’t worry. Countess Citri.”</p>
<p>At the mention of Amethyst, all eyes turned to her. They expected her to comment, it seemed. <em>What should I even say?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst thought a while and calmly replied, “It really depends on how you think of it. It’s a difference in perspective. If you think of it as something that pressures you then it will. If not, there is no need to stress yourself out so much. In that sense I believe Countess Citri will do a wonderful job.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Lady Skad,” said Countess Citri, amiably.</p>
<p>“Oh, please, it’s nothing,” said Amethyst, warmly, “I must apologize for wishing you late, but nonetheless, congratulations!”</p>
<p>Countess Citri beamed. It made Amethyst feel like she had said the right thing. “Truly, Lady Skad,” said Countess Citri, “You are great!”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” added Count Glacia, “The festival is prepared so greatly as well. I heard that one of your staff was fired so it must have been very challenging for you to do everything on your own. It is very impressive.”</p>
<p>“Oh, are you acquainted with the previous staff, Dajal?” asked Amethyst.</p>
<p>“Not very well, I am afraid,” said Count Glacia, “I simply noticed his absence because he was always present everywhere.”</p>
<p>Amethyst realized that they were waiting for an explanation. A long-term staff being fired was very unusual in such a big household. She was already in a bad mood and the silent question made her distressed.</p>
<p>“Dajal was dismissed because of his crimes worthy of much brutal punishments,” said Amethyst, “Since the management of the mansion falls under my jurisdiction as the lady of the house, I felt the need to act upon it.”</p>
