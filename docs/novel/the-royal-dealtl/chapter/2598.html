            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 75</strong></p>
<p>Amethyst was doubtless there would be a phase of trial and error. She’d gauged about a year for her plans to come to fruition. And then, when she wasn’t around, things would run smoothly without her influence.</p>
<p>She rested her hands on the table, her thoughts spinning themselves through her head. She had to get Alec to promise that he would never again neglect his people. He had an obligation to protect them.</p>
<p>She slumped to imitate Alec’s posture when he was in his own office.</p>
<p>She had always held dear the saying, ‘Those that do not work, deserve no food.’ And she had worked, so it was time for her food. It was time for her reward.</p>
<p>Then her thoughts turned to the time when she had taken a break from work to care for her newborn. Her life had changed then. The Americano coffee she used to buy from her favorite coffee shop had turned into instant coffee, which she stopped drinking anyway. Her chocolates and macarons changed to diapers and milk powders. Even though she didn’t have much money left to spend on herself, she still found it selfish and wasteful to indulge in her own pleasures. She saved everything she had, reminding herself that a good cup of coffee was a pack of diapers for a few days. She made sure her children only had the best, ate only the best food, spared no expense on them while neglecting her own happiness.</p>
<p>Whenever the money had run out, she’d felt awful asking her husband for more.</p>
<p>She was a mother; it was obligation to raise her children.</p>
<p>She a housewife; it was her responsibility to do the housework.</p>
<p>Even though raising a child and keeping a home was already a colossal task, she had lived in a society where being a housewife was seen as being free and jobless.</p>
<p>Or perhaps the ideas had come from watching her own mother while she’d been growing up, perhaps it had been the stereotypical mother roles portrayed in the dramas she’d watched on TV that she’d reinforced into her subconsciousness.</p>
<p>After she’d married, she’d been shaped to fit the moulds of mother and wife which was why she’d splurged on the luxuries in the mansion. But things were going to change.</p>
<p>Amethyst knew she wasn’t the perfect idea of what a Lady of the House should be, but she contented herself with the knowledge that she had done enough to deserve her reward.</p>
<p>“Well,” she said to herself, “my reward isn’t exactly grand. I am too humble with myself,” she tapped her fingers against the desk then stood.</p>
<p>She deserved her reward, she just had to go and fetch it.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Give it to me.” Amethyst demanded as she barged into Alec’s office.</p>
<p>Alexcent sat up in his chair, then relaxed once he realized it was her, “What?”</p>
<p>“What do you think?” She snapped, “The money Darla has been stealing all this time. You said it’s all in that grand Aran Bank.”</p>
<p>Alec met her glare and acid words calmly, “What do you plan to use all that money on?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean use?” Amethyst spat, “It belongs to the employees and will be rightfully returned to them. Give it back.”</p>
<p>“I see,” Alec muttered, “How would you like it then? Check? Cash? Gold?”</p>
<p>Amethyst was mute with fury. How could he be so brazen? How could he be so… detestable. Yes, he was detestable. Then again, he was someone who could turn a blind eye to all the corruption at Aran Bank.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do thing,” she snapped, “The money will be used to repair the damaged facilities and paid back to the employees from which it was stolen. All you have to do is put it somewhere in your legally operated bank. Lunia is going to help Roman with that. Just give them the account.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” Alec replied, his tone cool and level.</p>
<p>“And another thing. Now that you are in the position of duke, I want you to comply with all the moral obligations that come with it,” Amethyst said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?” he said with feigned innocence.</p>
<p>“Don’t you ever be a bystander when others are being debased and harassed. Don’t you ever turn a blind eye to those that choose to remain silent,” she seethed, “You will protect them. Don’t forget it is your duty to protect them.”</p>
<p>“…I will,” Alec replied, but his words were hollow and emotionless.</p>
<p>With that said, Alexcent lifted his pen and continued with his paperwork.</p>
<p><em>That’s it? Is that all he has to say? </em>she thought as the rage ebbed within her.</p>
<p>She supposed he had no real reason to say anything more, he was under no obligation to.</p>
<p><em>Is it too much for me to wish he would tell me more? Like why he owes Aran Bank? How much black money goes in and out of that place? How is he involved in such a business? For how long will be own that cursed place…?</em></p>
<p>Amethyst wanted to voice the questions that burned within her, but she couldn’t bring herself to voice them. She had no right to ask.</p>
<p>She felt her heart constrict painfully. She couldn’t understand why, which was what made her so angry. Instead of saying anything, she turned and left.</p>
