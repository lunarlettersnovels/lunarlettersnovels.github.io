            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 31 – Split in Half (2)</strong></p>
<p>“Pardon madam?” Pon looked at her like she had grown two heads.</p>
<p>“All of it. The bed, personal space, dressing room and even the bathroom. Please split in in half.”</p>
<p>“Why-?”</p>
<p>Pon seemed taken aback by the unexpected request and asked.</p>
<p><em>‘Why? Well that’s because we are in a contract marriage</em>.’ Amethyst couldn’t bring herself to explain so simply replied briefly.</p>
<p>“This has already been agreed with Alec-. No, the duke. I don’t need to explain why.”</p>
<p>“Ah…I see. Then how shall I split it in half?” Pon asked in a depressed tone as his hard work was requested to be split.</p>
<p>“Where did the duke sleep before?”</p>
<p>“He used his own personal bedroom across the hall.”</p>
<p>“All this while?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He prioritizes efficiency.”</p>
<p>“Well, then the duke will continue using that room. I will use this room except the duke’s personal space. Since I need the bathroom, reception area and dressing room.</p>
<p>“Uh. Yes.”</p>
<p>Pon wondered briefly if the lady was a gold-digger as he accepted her command.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>That evening. As any other day, Pon greeted Alexcent who had just returned from the palace.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, sir.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I have something to inform you….”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I informed Madam that the renovation for the bedroom had been completed.”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s finished earlier than expected.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Well, she wishes to use it alone and says it had already been discussed and agreed with you.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Alone?” He tilted his head momentarily, then seemed to remember something and replied dryly. “Ahhh, yes alright. Do as she wants. I will just stay in my previous room.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>Pon was about to leave and not disturb Alexcent any further.</p>
<p>“By the way, Pon.”</p>
<p>“So Ahem… late in the night…”</p>
<p>Pon wondered what his master was about to say and being so hesitant about it. Suddenly he felt afraid and tensed as he replied.</p>
<p>“Yes sir, please go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Can you make the maids guard around my office corridor?”</p>
<p>“Sorry?! But there are already the shadows that guard the mansion? Is something troubling you?”</p>
<p>“No but-. Just do as I say.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand. But it will be too hard for one to do all night, so I will place them on rotation to guard the corridor.”</p>
<p>“Don’t make it too obvious, just make sure they act naturally.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>Previously he had asked for all the remaining maids to be removed as their presence disturbed him, but Pon supposed with the new addition to the family, it was good that he was making sure he covered all grounds. Since it was only right for the employees to serve the master of the house, Pon made arrangements as such.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><em>‘Perhaps it was due to the late night talks with Alec. Or was it the rapidly approaching wedding?’</em></p>
<p>Amethyst walked around her bed, unable to lie down. She crossed her arm and rubbed her arm. She felt anxious.</p>
<p>Today after seeing the couple bedroom, her future of a married life felt imminent and real. Earlier, it had simply felt like a hypothetical situation. Something that was happening to another person. She couldn’t sleep from the nervousness and anxiety.</p>
<p>At times like this, she couldn’t help but think of him.</p>
<p><em>‘Yes, when I’m with him I feel at ease. I don’t feel anxious or nervous when I am bickering with him, in fact I don’t think of anything else.’</em></p>
<p>As her train of thoughts eventually came to an inconclusive end, Amethyst opened her bedroom door and made her way down.</p>
<p>Knock knock.</p>
<p>She entered the room as she knocked. But to her surprise and disappointment, his seat was empty.</p>
<p><em>‘He must have gone off for a while seeing how the lights were still on. What should I do? Should I go back?’</em></p>
<p>Unlike her thoughts, she found herself lingering on. As she contemplated what to do next, he opened the door and came in.</p>
<p>He must have taken a shower; unlike his usual self, his neatly combed hair was wet and tangled, and he had a gown on top of his unbuttoned shirt.</p>
<p>The droplets at the end of his hair shined along with his platinum hair.</p>
<p>“I see you haven’t fallen asleep yet.”</p>
<p>“I thought you would be busy today…”Seeing a new side to him made her trail off.</p>
<p>“Ahh, I got sweaty today. So what story are you here to tell me today?”</p>
<p>“Story?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you always distracted me with a story.”</p>
<p>“Not today. I just….Pon showed me the new bedroom today, and I said I would use it on my own…so I was going to tell you to continue using your current one….”</p>
<p>Amethyst stumbled on her words and made up an excuse.</p>
<p>“Alright. I get it.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to work late today as well?”</p>
<p>“No. I’m going to rest early today.”</p>
<p>Amethyst simply stared at him blankly not sure of what to say. He too didn’t avoid her gaze.</p>
<p><em>Thump-Thump.</em></p>
<p>Unlike her consciousness, her heart thumped loudly.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. I’ll walk you back.” Alexcent broke the silence. Amethyst simply nodded in reply.</p>
<p>As they left the office, Alexcent grabbed a hold of Amethyst’s hand. She looked up at him, taken aback by his sudden action, to which Alexcent replied by pointing in front with his chin. She saw two maids walking towards them from the other end of the corridor.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh. It’s because of the maids.’</em></p>
<p>Somehow because he held her hand. All the anxiety she had felt before seemed to disappear. She let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Even after the maids disappeared, Amethyst did not let go of his hand. Just like that the two of them walked hand in hand along the corridor in silence.</p>
<p>Like two lovers who didn’t want to say goodbye as they reached the end of the road, they stared at the door of her bedroom for a while. As if they didn’t want this night to end.</p>
<p><em>Thump- Thump</em></p>
<p>Her heart beat fiercely. And the hands that had been holding hers loosened its grip and wrapped her cheeks. Her eyes met the clear and intense eyes that seemed to be burning. And it was coming nearer towards her face.</p>
