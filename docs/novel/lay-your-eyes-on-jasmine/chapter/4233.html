            <h3>Chapter 63.2</h3>
<p>Jasmine sighed and glanced at the high-ranking nobles who were pretending to converse. Word would spread fast. She only hoped her Father wouldn’t hear about today’s incident.</p>
<p>“You are with some elders. Then I’ll leave now, Duke.”</p>
<p>“No, I was about to leave anyway.”</p>
<p>Didn’t you just come in? Jasmine blinked, but Richard was already walking quickly towards his companions, asking for their understanding.</p>
<p>The head of the imperial judiciary, who had been watching the two with interest, chuckled heartily and waved his cane.</p>
<p>“We old folks will play together. Hurry on, Duke.”</p>
<p>If it had come to this, it would have been embarrassing for Jasmine to refuse as well.</p>
<p>She awkwardly smiled and lightly greeted the nobles, who seemed somewhat pleased for some reason, before walking towards the door that Richard was now holding. It felt like being surrounded from all sides.</p>
<p>Jasmine passed by Richard, managing her complicated thoughts. Richard glanced over. Normally, he would have offered his arm immediately, but because of the pleasant weather, she simply looked up at the blue sky for a moment.</p>
<p>The clear color was appealing, but it felt suffocating at the same time. A carriage approached them.</p>
<p>Jasmine instinctively turned towards Richard to receive the escort, but for some reason, Richard stood still with a vacant expression on his face.</p>
<p>Like a spider who, momentarily entranced by the scent, missed catching its prey.</p>
<p>Jasmine called out to him hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Duke?”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Only then did Richard regain his composure, clenching and unclenching his fists in panic. Soon, he stood beside her with a nonchalant face.</p>
<p>She glanced at his extended palm for a moment, then placed hers on top of his and gracefully climbed into the wagon. Richard slowly rubbed his warm fingertips, which held her brief touch, and then boarded the wagon shortly.</p>
<p>The carriage was spacious enough yet felt narrow at the same time, at least to Jasmine. She exhaled softly, turning her gaze towards the window.</p>
<p>In truth, there was nowhere else to look but outside, not to face Richard, sitting across from her. However, he seemed to have different thoughts.</p>
<p>“It would be wise to increase your guards.”</p>
<p>Richard’s tongue touched his dry lips as he met Jasmine’s violet eyes.</p>
<p>“You were nearly in danger earlier.”</p>
<p>“It was uncomfortable but nothing serious. It was a public place, and I don’t think he’s foolish enough to forget who he was.”</p>
<p>At Jasmine’s seemingly calm words, the listener’s brow furrowed.</p>
<p>“He has already forgotten his duty and lost his reason. It’s unacceptable for a mere upstart, with no title, to threaten a member of the Great Duke’s family.”</p>
<p>Jasmine had no rebuttal to his stern remark. She, too, now knew that there were more people in the world who acted irrationally and recklessly, regardless of reason or sensibility.</p>
<p>This time, she was certainly rash in many ways.</p>
<p>They shouldn’t have formed such a frivolous relationship in the first place. She couldn’t even date people properly.</p>
<p>She sighed deeply. Of course, being bitten by a mad dog was the fault of the mad dog, not the one bitten, but there was no need to experience it in the first place.</p>
<p>“I knew you were emotional, but I didn’t expect this.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never had such an incident before, thankfully.”</p>
<p>“It hasn’t even been a few days since we met…”</p>
<p>Jasmine muttered to herself softly. But in Richard’s keen ears, her words rang clear.</p>
<p>Huh? Jasmine blinked. It seemed like she heard a faint creaking sound somewhere. Raising her head, Richard just remained expressionless and silent. Then, he faintly smiled.</p>
<p>“You’re still fearless, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>His tone was gentle but as cold as ever. Jasmine felt uncomfortable under his penetrating gaze.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, wasn’t it inappropriate for them to have such a conversation?</p>
<p>Even such a scene felt awkward. Everything kept feeling awkward. She was embarrassed. Of all days, she had to meet him when she was ending things so abruptly, and she didn’t feel good about it.</p>
<p>Richard, observing Jasmine’s expression, softened his tone somewhat.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to blame you. Unreasonable violence is entirely the fault of the perpetrator, not something the victim should bear.”</p>
<p>No, I just don’t like it because it’s you who saw it. Jasmine muttered and turned her head towards the window.</p>
<p>“Right. You wouldn’t know he’s a wounded man just by looking at him.”</p>
<p>It was an offhand remark, but upon saying it, it felt bone-chilling. However, it was said already. The silence grew thicker, but Jasmine stubbornly remained silent.</p>
<p>She just wanted to stay there until they parted ways without saying a word.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>I wish he hadn’t called me in that tone.</p>
<p>“Have you been well lately?”</p>
<p>Don’t ask me how I’m doing. It’s not the time.</p>
<p>“I… have thought about you a lot, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’re acting yourself.”</p>
