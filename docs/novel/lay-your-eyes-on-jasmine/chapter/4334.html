            <p><strong>Chapter 13.1</strong></p>
<p>The last time they had seen each other was a month ago, and it felt as if they had just spoken yesterday. But now, the conversation felt somewhat surreal.</p>
<p>Moreover, they hadn’t parted on good terms, and Richard knew she wouldn’t treat him with the same kindness anymore. He felt a tinge of bitterness about it, but he never thought Jasmine would get over her emotions so quickly. It was only natural, but for some reason, it felt strange.</p>
<p>Could one month be enough for those intense, passionate emotions to fade away? Richard had wondered vaguely whether his affection for Lily, as deep as it was, could be any less than Jasmine’s.</p>
<p>Unlike him, who feared risking his friendship with Lily, Jasmine had been honest and straightforward about her feelings. Maybe that’s why it bothered him more. Richard briefly felt a connection with Jasmine despite their different backgrounds.</p>
<p>Maybe growing up showered with love made one this way. It allowed people to be open and expressive with their feelings. Her pure and clear eyes, which always revealed her emotions, didn’t bother him. Her occasional anger and straightforwardness hadn’t been annoying either.</p>
<p>He had felt a bit overwhelmed, but he couldn’t find any anger in him now. Richard chided himself for being too harsh on that day. Did he need to make such a big deal out of Jasmine having a few drinks? If she indeed had been an awful person, it would have been different, but she wasn’t.</p>
<p>He should have just accepted it, but that lingering unease remained with him ever since.</p>
<p>She seemed to have moved on and was doing well now… Even though that guy seemed less than ideal for her, he appeared sincere.</p>
<p>Maybe it was for the best.</p>
<p>“Well… that’s a relief.”</p>
<p>Richard shook his head, dismissing his conflicting emotions and blaming it on fatigue. He then left without a sound.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>“Our estate is known for its wine production.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>
<p>Jasmine sat in the carriage, occasionally looking outside and responding to Charles’s conversation.</p>
<p>Their dating pattern was quite consistent. Charles was the one who talked more, while Jasmine mainly listened. Jasmine was usually lively with friends or family, laughing, chatting, and joining in the conversation. However, strangely, her speech had diminished when she was with him. It wasn’t that she remained silent; she just spoke less than usual.</p>
<p>Charles had a strong urge to share more about himself, and Jasmine wanted to maintain the traditional dating dynamics where gentlemen led the conversation, so this pattern had developed.</p>
<p>But it felt somewhat… unsatisfying.</p>
<p>Nodding and only listening wasn’t as enjoyable as she had expected. Maybe good people weren’t necessarily a good match for each other. She knew he was a nice person, but that seemed to be it.</p>
<p>Sighing inwardly, Jasmine felt a pang of regret about today’s picnic. Usually, they would spend their time in town cafes and return home when they wanted. It was comfortable, but today, they had to stay together for longer.</p>
<p>She found it tiresome, especially when they didn’t share much in common or had much to talk about.</p>
<p><em>‘Ugh, dating is truly exhausting, both mentally and physically. Why do people even bother with this?’</em></p>
<p>It had been exciting at first, but now it felt more like a chore. Jasmine wanted to go home.</p>
<p>She wished she could be with her mother, the Duchess, for a tea time and have a proper conversation. Or maybe play card and puzzle games with her brothers and enjoy sweet cakes. She longed to be home.</p>
<p>“Um, Jasmine?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>They recently decided to address each other by first name instead of using formal titles like “Lady.” He had asked for permission cautiously as if it were a significant change, but Jasmine, known for her broad-mindedness, readily agreed.</p>
<p>To her, what was the big deal about using names? Whenever she attended social events in the capital, her friends would address her by first name.</p>
<p>“Did I talk too much, by any chance?” Charles nervously asked.</p>
<p>“What? No.”</p>
<p>It was just like usual. Jasmine blinked slowly, and he scratched the back of his head.</p>
<p>“I hope you didn’t feel pressured to go on this outing…”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Had she given it away? Feeling a bit guilty, Jasmine put on her cordial smile. “Well, it’s a good opportunity to get some fresh air. Don’t worry about it,” she said.</p>
<p>“Oh, okay.”</p>
<p>Charles appeared somewhat relieved and touched. While they smiled at each other, Jasmine couldn’t help but wish that time would pass quickly.</p>
<p>Maybe that place he called the “estate” would be as breathtaking as he claimed. If their estate produced unique wine, Jasmine thought it would be nice to receive some as a gift. After all, it had been a while since she went on an outing like this, and she wanted a generous souvenir to show her friends.</p>
<p>With positive thoughts swirling in her mind, Jasmine once again pulled the curtain aside and looked out of the window. Charles continued with his travel guide duties.</p>
<p>“In truth, our region is not widely known as a tourist destination. It’s a small, secluded place that only a select few are familiar with. For instance, His Highness Prince Jilian’s private villa is situated near the forest, and he often comes here for hunting or to host parties with his friends. He sometimes seeks out our estate’s wine…”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
