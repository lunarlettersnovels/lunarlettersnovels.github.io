            <h3>Chapter 96.1</h3>
<p>“What love?”</p>
<p>Jasmine burst into laughter as she spoke, and Richard grumbled in displeasure. The snowman was so perfectly round and serious-looking that young Richard would startle every morning when he saw it in the garden.</p>
<p>He couldn’t just get rid of it, so the artificial snowman continued to stare into Richard’s room until the weather warmed up.</p>
<p>Their parents probably found the siblings’ antics cute and endearing, but Richard found it absurd and annoying. It was so ridiculous that he didn’t even feel like getting angrier.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he would catch Risha looking at him with a proud expression, which made him feel a surge of emotion, but he would quickly lose his energy before acting on it. Such incidents were a constant in his childhood. Now, it just made him laugh in disbelief.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s hilarious. When I saw you earlier, I thought siblings are all the same. You two seem to get along well.”</p>
<p>“Why say such harsh things?”</p>
<p>Usually, it would be a joke, but this time Richard was genuinely serious. This made Jasmine giggle even more.</p>
<p>At that moment.</p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>For an instant, she felt as if someone was staring at her intensely. Before she could look in that direction, Richard’s voice caught her attention, and she turned her head. Maybe it was just her imagination. She dismissed it casually.</p>
<p>“If there’s any siblings who really get along, it would be you and your brothers, Jasmine. Honestly, I’ve always thought it was nice to see.”</p>
<p>“My brothers are just overly dramatic and silly.”</p>
<p>Jasmine muttered, suddenly indifferent at the mention of her brothers. Even as she said that, she knew well that her brothers were particularly kind and gentle, always giving in to their youngest sister.</p>
<p>Despite their large frames, her brothers were gentle enough to let a wildcat-like little sister pull their hair while they yelped “ouch, ouch” without resisting. They would just bear because she was their little sister.</p>
<p>Feeling a sudden wave of guilt and affection for her brothers, Jasmine fiddled with her ear.</p>
<p>“I was immature, but I was lucky to be the youngest. I grew up receiving a lot of benefits. Even now.”</p>
<p>“You’re not immature. Who says that?”</p>
<p>Richard tilted his head, but Jasmine laughed at his serious expression.</p>
<p>“I do. I’m immature.”</p>
<p>“No, you’re not.”</p>
<p>“How would you know, Duke?”</p>
<p>Richard’s blue eyes narrowed slightly as he looked down at her.</p>
<p>“I’m watching you right now.”</p>
<p>On a street where the autumn leaves fluttered down, the two of them stared at each other. His warm and gentle eyes lingered in her heart. Jasmine’s red lips parted slightly. A sigh escaped her.</p>
<p>‘Why is this person coming to me now, of all times?</p>
<p>Only after all the courage, pride, and love that once filled me have been completely exhausted.</p>
<p>Now, all that remains in that place are the fears and hesitations, afraid of being hurt again.</p>
<p>Why only after everything has passed, why….’</p>
<p>For a moment, she felt a pang of pity, resentment, and sorrow, making her heart ache.</p>
<p>The love that couldn’t bloom properly and faded away because the timing was off, pained her.</p>
<p>“Richard.”</p>
<p>‘I hate you.</p>
<p>Her tear-filled eyes slowly erased the smile from his face. His hands, confused and unsure, reached out. She did not avoid him and looked at his contorted face. If she said she liked the sad expression he wore because of her, would he also lose affection for her?</p>
<p>“Jasmine?”</p>
<p>Just before his hand touched her eyes, a familiar voice spoke.</p>
<p>Startled, Jasmine and Richard, who furrowed his brows, simultaneously turned to see Caras and Nikki standing there with bewildered expressions.</p>
<p>To be precise, Nikki, having roughly grasped the situation from their close proximity and the atmosphere, was pulling on Caras’s arm, but Caras stood rooted in place, slowly scowling menacingly. He quickly approached and pulled Jasmine towards him.</p>
<p>Richard stood still, but his deep blue eyes followed the wrist Caras had grabbed. Recognizing this as a fellow man, Caras’s eyes grew even colder.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time, Your Grace, Duke of Aion.”</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time, Lord Caras.”</p>
<p>At Richard’s soft and polite call, Caras twisted his lips and replied courteously. Jasmine was actually quite surprised inside, as it was the first time she had seen her second older brother’s cynical face.</p>
<p>“Now that you have become the official head of the military. By title, you are not someone to be addressed so casually.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Richard, after staring at him for a moment, conceded. However, despite referring to him as a superior, Caras’s tone remained sharp throughout.</p>
<p>“However, I am curious as to why you are with my sister. To my knowledge, there is no reason for you, Your Grace, to be with Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“There’s no reason not to be together either.</p>
<p>Richard’s slow reply sparked a fire in Caras’s eyes. It was clear that his words had provoked him.</p>
<p>“Out of moral decency and common sense, it is right to keep your distance. Your Grace, while you have no obligation to our family or my sister, crossing the line any further is undoubtedly disrespectful. I believe you understand what I am saying.”</p>
<p>Richard remained silent. Instead, he glanced at Jasmine, who was tugging at her brother’s sleeve, uncharacteristically sharp in his demeanor. Caras frowned and hid her behind him. Jasmine whispered softly.</p>
