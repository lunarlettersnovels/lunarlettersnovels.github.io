            <h3>Chapter 93.2</h3>
<p>“What about the task I assigned you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that. The tests are all done.”</p>
<p>Risha pointed with her index finger to a spot, and Richard retrieved a piece of paper from there, narrowing his eyes as he examined it. Jasmine, sensing the moment, quickly stepped closer on tiptoe to look at it with him.</p>
<p>Richard immediately lowered his arm to make it easier for her to see. His unusually considerate and gentle demeanor made Risha smirk mischievously, only to receive a silent flick on the forehead, causing her to pout.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Jasmine sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s really clean, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>Richard murmured. His eyebrows furrowed. Although it was a case he had taken an interest in thanks to Jasmine, there were many aspects that seemed troubling at first glance. Naturally, as a perfectionist, he felt compelled to thoroughly investigate and resolve every detail within his domain.</p>
<p>He crossed his arms and fell into thought.</p>
<p>“There is a possibility that Salinger altered or manipulated the diagnostic results, so I secretly set aside a portion of the blood we drew from Soyer. If he truly is an addict, there is no way he could avoid detection in these test results.”</p>
<p>Gesturing towards his sister, who seemed lost in thought and staring blankly into space, Richard finished his sentence.</p>
<p>“She may be lacking in other areas, but her skills are undeniable.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, then what did we see? Could he have taken it and used it elsewhere?”</p>
<p>It didn’t add up. As Jasmine frowned in frustration, Richard glanced at her, then folded the test results and tucked them into his coat. He gently patted Jasmine’s voluminous blonde hair, much like one would pet a small cat, and spoke kindly.</p>
<p>“Anyway, isn’t this a good thing? It means he’s innocent.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“It’s better to find out there was no problem at all than to solve an existing one.”</p>
<p>Indeed, that was true. Feeling somewhat deflated yet half-relieved, Jasmine’s shoulders relaxed. Was it over now? She sincerely hoped that Marian, who had always found life difficult and overwhelming, would be okay now.</p>
<p>Richard gently tugged her arm as they left the room, not forgetting to glare at Risha to clean up the mess.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Where to?”</p>
<p>As Jasmine widened her eyes, being led by Richard, he grinned.</p>
<p>“Since the case is resolved, we should celebrate.”</p>
<p>Come with me. Let’s have a change of scenery.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Richard took her to a newly opened dessert shop in the capital. It had just started gaining a reputation, so there weren’t many customers yet. As Jasmine sniffed the distinctive, rich, and sweet aroma of baking cakes and pies like a curious puppy, Richard smiled silently.</p>
<p>“Have you been here before?”</p>
<p>“No. But I’ve heard about it. They say the pastry chef here is exceptionally skilled. He studied abroad in Aransua and returned with great expertise.”</p>
<p>Jasmine snapped her fingers and whispered as if sharing a secret piece of high-class information. Richard watched her with interest, or perhaps as if he were observing a chick eagerly explaining something.</p>
<p>Resting his chin on his hand, he asked softly, “Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Because of that, he seems to have a high opinion of himself. Certain tables are only available by reservation, and they selectively accept customers. The investor must be a very wealthy and powerful person or have strong backing. Many of my friends have been turned away, and they’re all quite impressive. I wonder what the criteria are.”</p>
<p>As Jasmine spoke, she suddenly realized how surprising it was that she was in such a place and stopped mid-sentence, snapping her fingers in astonishment.</p>
<p>“But how did we get in here? Is it because you’re the Duke of Aion?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? Maybe it’s because I’m with the most esteemed lady of the social scene, Grand Duchess Jasmine Riovanni.”</p>
<p>Richard tapped the menu with a smile.</p>
<p>Seated comfortably on a leather sofa, his long legs crossed and dressed in a glossy tan coat and black trousers, he exuded the relaxed elegance of a noble. His loosely draped wrist, the playful arch of his eyebrows, and the gentle smile on his lips all combined to create a picture-perfect image.</p>
<p>Meeting his blue eyes, which were fixed solely on her, Jasmine felt a strange sense of embarrassment. Perhaps it was because she had keenly noticed the subtle and curious glances from the women around them since they had entered the shop.</p>
<p>Regardless of their attention, Richard seemed completely focused on her, which felt oddly peculiar.</p>
<p>Jasmine found it difficult to keep looking at his kind, smiling eyes, so she naturally averted her gaze. Pretending to choose from the menu, she pulled the menu card from under his hand.</p>
<p>“What’s the signature dish here? It won’t be too sweet, will it?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m sure you’ll like it.”</p>
<p>With a subtle nuance in his voice, Richard leaned closer to her, his upper body inclining towards her as she looked down. They ended up looking at the menu together, their heads almost touching. Jasmine blinked several times, hearing his soft, low voice right by her ear.</p>
<p>Glancing at him, she saw Richard seriously recommending various dishes to her, his blue eyes focused intently on the menu as if he were a chef himself.</p>
<p>Jasmine found herself staring at his dark eyebrows, the elegant white forehead, the bridge of his nose, and the long eyelashes framing his blue eyes. His well-shaped lips moved as he spoke to her.</p>
