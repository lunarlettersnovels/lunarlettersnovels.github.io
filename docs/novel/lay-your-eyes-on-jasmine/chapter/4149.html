            <p><strong>Chapter 106.1</strong></p>
<p>The two looked at each other as if they were alone in the world. Jasmine noticed his fingertips trembling slightly, just like her heart.</p>
<p>At that moment, although she might regret it later, Jasmine spoke what her heart desired.</p>
<p>“Yes. I want to get to know this person better too.”</p>
<p>Richard’s eyes shone with joy. Such beautiful eyes they were. Never changing, no matter when she looked at them.</p>
<p>The Grand Duke let out a half-despairing sigh and asked.</p>
<p>“So you both feel the same way? Good heavens. Our baby is already thinking about marriage…”</p>
<p>“What? That’s not it though?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the heated atmosphere shattered completely. Everyone stared at Jasmine with blank faces as she blinked innocently. James cleared his throat and asked with a slightly trembling voice.</p>
<p>“But, Jasmine. You said you like him…”</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s all. Marriage is a serious matter – should everyone who likes each other get married?”</p>
<p>It was an almost ruthlessly firm response. The Grand Duke’s family members, who had secretly hoped for this, felt strange about this perfect wall she had built and naturally turned to look at Richard sitting beside her.</p>
<p>He was still smiling, but had slightly stiffened. Seeing his twitching eyes, James clicked his tongue briefly, while Caras smiled contentedly, feeling half-pleased and half-pitying and amused by the Duke, thinking ‘That tomboy, as always.’</p>
<p>“Hahaha. So, our daughter, you want to date but don’t want to marry, is that what you’re saying?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t exactly say that…”</p>
<p>But when she thought about it, it was somewhat similar. As Jasmine awkwardly scratched her cheek, the Grand Duke laughed heartily and grumbled about “kids these days.” However, his smile was brighter than before, stretching from ear to ear, unlike during the previous romantic atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose. Your aunt is still living comfortably unmarried. Why shouldn’t our daughter do the same? It’s not like she lacks money, and with two older brothers and future nieces and nephews, she won’t be lonely. Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Jasmine, if you get lonely, come live with your brother.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good. But Jasmine, come to my house instead of brother’s. Who knows, he might marry a mean-spirited sister-in-law.”</p>
<p>“Are you doubting my judgment? What about you?”</p>
<p>“Well, what about me?”</p>
<p>Caras secretly winked at Jasmine.</p>
<p>Knowing what it meant, Jasmine chuckled. Caras married to Nicky and their rabbit-like children.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it made her heart soft – it was such a cute, lovely, and warm scene. But then Jasmine noticed Richard sitting silently through the family banter and thought ‘oops.’ She hadn’t been considerate enough of him.</p>
<p>Though it was like a cat being considerate of a mouse, Jasmine belatedly watched his reaction and said,</p>
<p>“Well, but this is just my thinking. Duke, you might feel differently.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Huh? Richard, who had been quietly expressionless, suddenly turned to Jasmine with a casual smile. Although that smile was dazzlingly bright, Jasmine felt something unsettling about it.</p>
<p>“It’s Jasmine’s life, so of course you should do as you wish. How could I impose my desires on you?”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>His answer and attitude were a million years apart from the Richard she had known until now. Jasmine looked askance at him, his face too ideally calm, as if discussing someone else’s matter. A strange sense of irritation arose.</p>
<p>Jasmine asked suspiciously, as if testing him.</p>
<p>“Even if I say I’ll never marry?”</p>
<p>“That’s fine.”</p>
<p>Jasmine tilted her head expressionlessly at his mechanical and firm response.</p>
<p>“It’s fine?”</p>
<p>“What else can I do? I’ll just have to ask Raisha to produce an heir.”</p>
<p>“Is that okay? You’re being quite tyrannical to your brother.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t do anything anyway, so what’s wrong with doing that much for the family?”</p>
<p>“What if we break up after dating? Will you then hurriedly marry someone else?”</p>
<p>“There’s no possibility of me wanting to marry anyone but you. Do you think I would break up with you?”</p>
<p>“You never know what might happen.”</p>
<p>“Some things are absolutely unchangeable. I have no intention of ending things with you.”</p>
<p>“What if I want to?”</p>
<p>“Is that what you want?”</p>
<p>“Hey, um…”</p>
<p>The Grand Duke’s family members, who had been watching the two trade remarks without giving an inch, broke into a nervous sweat as the atmosphere grew increasingly heated. Finally, James awkwardly smiled and intervened.</p>
<p>“Are you two fighting?”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“No, we’re not.”</p>
<p>Though both answered firmly, their eyes were gleaming with more intensity than necessary. Both seemed provoked for some reason.</p>
<p>While it was understandable for the Duke to be upset when the woman he loves says she doesn’t want to marry him, it was unclear why Jasmine was so disturbed. She pointed out sharply.</p>
<p>“You say you’ll go along with whatever I want, but you don’t really mean it at all. Did you think I wouldn’t know?”</p>
<p>“I have never lied to you.”</p>
<p>“You might not have lied directly. But you just don’t tell the important things.”</p>
<p>And then he gradually pushes people toward what he wants. So subtly that they don’t notice. As if I haven’t experienced this before.</p>
<p>Until now, in most cases, she had let things slide with thoughts like “maybe that’s possible” or “oh, so that’s what it was,” but it was starting to bother her now. Jasmine occasionally disliked his controlling perfectionism and tendency to manipulate others, traits closer to his true nature.</p>
<p>While it could be comfortable, attractive, and pleasant at times, it could also feel threatening and dismissive of her own will. This had been the fundamental reason for their ongoing conflict.</p>
