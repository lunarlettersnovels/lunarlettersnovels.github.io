            <h3>Chapter 68.2</h3>
<p>Richard, who was lying on a long sofa in the corner of the library with his arm over his eyes, tilted his head irritably. Holding a book, Risha crossed her arms and looked at him with a disdainful expression, as if to say, “What are you, a loafer?”</p>
<p>Normally, his military discipline would react strongly to such insolence, and he would snap back at that impertinent look, but Richard was too exhausted to argue. He merely glanced at her and then resumed his position.</p>
<p>He felt a headache coming on and thought that maybe sleeping would help. It wasn’t his usual way of dealing with things, but for now, it seemed like the best remedy.</p>
<p>Risha tilted her head, puzzled by the sight of him sprawled out like a large dog under the scorching sun. How strange. Normally, he’d be mocking her with his cold demeanor.</p>
<p>But Risha believed that the best way to maintain good sibling relations was to stay out of each other’s business, so she shrugged and left.</p>
<p>However, an hour later, having indulged herself in the vast collection of books accumulated by the Duke’s family over generations, and selecting a few to take with her—she noticed Richard still lying there, motionless.</p>
<p>Seeing him still there, Risha stopped. Having spent years at the Aion Duchy, she knew this was an unusual sight. Richard, who hated wasting time and was a workaholic, lying around like this in the middle of the day?</p>
<p>Despite her dislike for her brother, Risha’s curiosity got the better of her. She threw the pile of books onto the opposite sofa and settled down with her hands in her gown pockets. Then, she extended her foot to nudge him.</p>
<p>“Hey brother, get up for a second.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I know you can hear me. If you sleep there, you’ll get a crick in your neck.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“You’re being annoying. Go to your room if you want to sleep.”</p>
<p>Having studied medicine, Risha had a certain officiousness about her in these matters. Richard didn’t look well, and it bothered her. She felt like poking him until he moved out of her sight.</p>
<p>“If you’re not feeling well, call the doctor. I’m not going to treat you.”</p>
<p>Her last remark was the most genuine. As a qualified specialist and a professor of medicine, she regularly saw patients at the academy. She had no desire to extend her medical practice to her home, especially not for Richard Aion, her brother who was like a stone-hearted human.</p>
<p>As his only sister continued to prod him in her indifferent tone, Richard’s brow furrowed into a fierce line.</p>
<p>“Leave me alone. Go away.”</p>
<p>“Then hide somewhere out of sight. Why are you lying here, being an eyesore?”</p>
<p>This time, she must have hit a nerve. His cold blue eyes glinted sharply through his splayed fingers, focusing on his half-reclining sister with an icy glare.</p>
<p>That look always preceded a flick on the forehead, so Risha felt a chill down her spine before defensively adopting an innocent expression.</p>
<p>“Hah.”</p>
<p>Usually, by now, he would have gotten up, unable to contain his temper, but Richard merely closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Risha was surprised. Is he really sick?</p>
<p>“Did you eat something bad?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Just go.”</p>
<p>“What did you eat?”</p>
<p>“Go.”</p>
<p>“Stomach ache? Diarrhea? Constipation?”</p>
<p>Veins stood out on Richard’s forehead. Before he could pick up the cigarette case on the table to throw at her, Risha, with years of sibling reflexes, quickly grabbed a book to shield herself.</p>
<p>Not just any book, but an encyclopedia of herbal medicine. As expected of herself, the youngest professor and top graduate of the academy! An excellent choice! This book was thick enough to stop a bullet. Pleased with herself, she glanced at the now-quiet Richard.</p>
<p>Richard, after rubbing his face in frustration, put down the cigarette case and resumed his rigid, mummy-like posture. He sighed deeply, as if the world were ending.</p>
<p>Lowering her defensive book, Risha adjusted her glasses.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with him? The same man who would chase her down with a broken leg just to grab her cheek and twist it.</p>
<p>There were many reasons why these siblings had a strained relationship, but aside from Richard’s hatred for insubordination and his strictness, Risha had also annoyed her brother on several occasions (though never intentionally). Their personalities clashed terribly.</p>
<p>Richard liked everything neat, orderly, and hated having his belongings touched. Risha, on the other hand, was neither tidy nor organized. She would doodle absentmindedly anywhere, leave things lying around, and occasionally forget she’d used Richard’s things.</p>
<p>Naturally, Richard would be furious and reprimand her, and Risha, holding a grudge against her brother for making her run laps around the parade ground over such trivial matters, once released a lab rat into his room.</p>
<p>She had considered it a considerate gesture, giving him a clean white rat, keeping his fastidiousness in mind. But Richard, ungrateful as ever, retaliated even more severely. He had been too young to care about consequences.</p>
<p>Risha spent the night chasing about a dozen frogs that hopped around her room. Since then, she had developed an aversion to frogs and had to retake a course at the academy because she screamed during frog dissections.</p>
