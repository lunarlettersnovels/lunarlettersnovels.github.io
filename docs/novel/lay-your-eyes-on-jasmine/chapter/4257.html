            <p><strong>Chapter 51.2</strong></p>
<p><em>Well, that’s just how Richard is. At the very least, he looked sound of mind. So that’s fortunate.</em></p>
<p>One corner of his mouth curled up; the Crown Prince dryly brushed aside his mess and set the warm mug of tea on his table. Richard stared for an unusually long time at the cloudy steam rising from the cup. Jilian twitched.</p>
<p>“Go on. I heard you didn’t eat or drink anything. If you catch a cold, you won’t be of any use. So, gulp it down. Didn’t you like this when you were young?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>But what Richard was thinking about was Jasmine.</p>
<p>A few days ago, when the rain came and all social engagements were canceled, Richard and Jasmine spent the whole day locked in their room, drinking warm milk, intertwining their bodies, whispering to each other, giggling at trivial things, and spending the day with only each other.</p>
<p>She loved milk like a child, so he diligently filled her mug with foamy, warm milk and added a teaspoon of sweet honey. He kissed her damp cheeks, embraced her naked body from behind, and held her close as she giggled with tickles.</p>
<p>Ah, that fragrance, laughter, and her warm skin like milk…</p>
<p>“Why are you like this? What’s really going on with you? It was strange that the Lady had left so abruptly, and she shouldn’t…”</p>
<p>Jilian’s words trailed off, and Richard stared at her with unfocused eyes.</p>
<p>“Jill.”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>“Jasmine asked to end things between us.”</p>
<p>Jilian’s eyebrows shot up. Silence followed. There was a pause, and then he crossed his arms in thought.</p>
<p>“Is it a private matter?”</p>
<p>“If it is, it is. If it isn’t, it isn’t.”</p>
<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“She heard it.”</p>
<p>Richard stared vacantly down at the floor, then glanced up and stared at the door of the study, which was tightly closed today.</p>
<p>Would it have mattered if she hadn’t overheard the conversation? It’s impossible to know. The truth was, it was a starting point, but their relationship had never really stabilized.</p>
<p>After all these events, the once arrogant man, thinking he could easily have her, had to admit it was not easy. A week was too short. But it was enough to captivate and drive a person crazy.</p>
<p>“She overheard our conversation yesterday morning.”</p>
<p>“What’s that? Wasn’t it about you falling head over heels, anxiously wanting to get married quickly—”</p>
<p>Just as Jilian was about to continue, something came to his mind. They didn’t just discuss the proposal.</p>
<p>They also talked about the necessity of the Liovanni Duchy, and it seemed clear that Richard was well aware of such political connections. If she heard only that part by any chance…</p>
<p>“Did she…”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Damn it, what a mess.”</p>
<p>Luck can be so unpredictable. Jilian sighed, rubbing his forehead. It was a terrible mistake, and he had made it worse by getting involved.</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment, then glanced up at his cousin, who looked so calm, which made him seem even more out of sorts. Richard’s eyes, which were always clear and lately sparkling like stars, were opaque and blurry. Jilian clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“What’s there not to be okay about?”</p>
<p>“I mean, that woman. You really liked her a lot. It’s the first time I’ve seen you so fond of anything since you received the sword the king gave you when you were a child. Risha broke it, and the war for the Duke of Aion’s succession almost started then.”</p>
<p>“You told me that a broken bone was grounds for disqualification.”</p>
<p>Even though it was inappropriate to stop a cousin who was determined to kill his younger sister for such a reason, Jilian just shrugged his shoulders then and now.</p>
<p>“That’s the most effective way to make you listen.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then, what do you plan to stop me with this time?”</p>
<p>When Richard asked with a self-deprecating smile, the Crown Prince, who was carefully scrutinizing him, asked in return.</p>
<p>“I suppose you’re thinking of doing something to ‘stop me’?”</p>
<p>“If necessary.”</p>
<p>Richard replied tersely, his face too stark and dry for the jilted subject. But Jilian, who was tapping his fingers on the table, frowned. He felt more unease for the same reasons as Risha’s comment about her brother being a ‘good-looking as!shole’.</p>
<p>Richard Aion tends to be extremely calm in the moments before he gets really pissed off or explodes. Before he does something crazy. It’s like a dormant volcano at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>Jilian made a pained sound and rubbed his forehead where a headache was brewing.</p>
<p>“Crazy bastard. She’s the golden leaf of Liovanni. You didn’t forget that, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do? Are you going to resort to barbaric methods like kidnapping? Do you know it’s illegal?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I wouldn’t do anything that brings such disgrace to her.”</p>
<p>Richard replied, raising his eyebrows. Jilian scoffed in return. “Why, then, you’re going to scoop her up and lock her in your room so no one can find out?”</p>
<p>“I’d do it if I were sure she’d forgive me, but I don’t want to be hated even more here, so I’ll put up with it.”</p>
<p>“You’re crazy.”</p>
<p>Even Jillian shook his head in disbelief. Anyone else would think he was joking, but Richard meant it.</p>
<p>Aside from anything personal, he felt a little sorry for Jasmine. How she’d fallen for such a jerk. He was so blind. It was better to have a solemn, respectful marriage, but he was an asshole who knew no bounds once he got stuck.</p>
