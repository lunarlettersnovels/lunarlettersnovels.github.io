            <p><strong>Chapter 23.1</strong></p>
<p>“Ah, yes!”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s underwear had borne the brunt of the chaos from last night and now lay in tatters. However, she had no choice but to wear it, as the alternative was to go out without any underwear. She hastily put on her underwear and froze before she could pull it up.</p>
<p>Richard, who had suddenly raised his upper body, was looking at her with his arms on his thighs. There were no blemishes on his flawless upper body, but her nail marks remained vividly red on his skin.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Perhaps there would never be another moment in Jasmine’s entire life that felt as embarrassing as this one.</p>
<p>Jasmine made a strange noise and tried to rush out, but before she could take a step, her wrist was caught, and she was pulled back.</p>
<p>He moved so effortlessly that Jasmine felt like she might be a mere doll. As she lay down on the incredibly soft bed, Jasmine looked at the man who had taken her place with a dumbfounded expression.</p>
<p>He had just woken up, and it seemed he was still not fully awake. The man, pressing his eyebrow with his long index finger, squinted and observed her. Yet, even amid this, his gaze never left Jasmine.</p>
<p>She felt like a mouse trapped under the claws of a predator. Was this the same person she knew? It was as if he was an entirely different person despite having the same face. Just a single glance had changed everything.</p>
<p>As she licked her dry lips, his blue eyes remained fixed on them. Jasmine felt a mixture of trepidation and excitement in his intense gaze. Subconsciously, she realized that their relationship had completely changed since last night, but she was still young and confused, unable to grasp it fully.</p>
<p>And finally, he spoke.</p>
<p>“Where are you going? Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Had this person ever called her by name before? Until now, it had always been polite titles. It felt so unfamiliar, and simultaneously, he called her by name so naturally that Jasmine was even more bewildered.</p>
<p>Oh, come to think of it, it wasn’t the first time.</p>
<p>As she recalled the voice he had whispered in her ear all night, heat rushed to her face, leaving her flustered. He was quietly observing her, and with the back of his hand, he brushed her flushed cheek. He intended to check her temperature, but it had the opposite effect on Jasmine’s heart.</p>
<p>“No fever. Are you feeling unwell, perhaps? You pushed yourself too hard yesterday…”</p>
<p>“No, I’m perfectly healthy!”</p>
<p>Jasmine replied hastily, like an eager student responding to a teacher’s question. She wished he would put some distance between himself and her heart. Every inch of their skin that touched felt scorching hot, and her nerves were on edge.</p>
<p>It wasn’t entirely false that she felt invigorated after that intense night. Despite lacking talent in martial arts, Jasmine had received training in various activities within her social circle, including horseback riding, ballet, and self-defense. She had developed a strong endurance.</p>
<p>Looking at Richard’s well-defined abs peeking through, Jasmine couldn’t help but swallow hard.</p>
<p><em>Wow, did this man coat his body with honey? How could he look so delicious and yet…</em></p>
<p>“I must be going crazy.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>Richard initially wore a haughty expression, then pursed his lips, then frowned, displaying a wide range of emotions as he silently observed the young lady who seemed to undergo various emotional changes.</p>
<p>For some reason, his penetrating gaze made Jasmine feel a little uneasy. He looked relaxed as if he was in control of this relationship.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief. I was worried. I… couldn’t control myself.”</p>
<p>He gently murmured, and when he leaned in to kiss Jasmine’s lips, she froze. Startled eyes watched as he stroked her hair and then closed his eyes, kissing her. But her confusion led her to bite his lips abruptly.</p>
<p>Richard had a surprised expression as he pulled his head back, but Jasmine was even more astonished.</p>
<p><em>‘Nooo! I almost pounced on him because it felt too good. I didn’t even realize it…’</em></p>
<p>She made her excuses silently and spat out excuses like a gun. “You see, I was just surprised. How did we end up like this…?”</p>
<p>“You don’t remember?” he said, his voice low. Jasmine involuntarily shivered.</p>
<p>Even as his lip bled slightly from her bite, the man wiped it away with the back of his hand, his eyes narrowing beneath. Jasmine felt an eerie sensation down her spine from his cool yet heated gaze.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because they hadn’t seen each other in a while, but when she conversed with the Duke she had last seen a month ago, there were moments when she felt a similar sense of unease creeping over her. It was like a flashing red warning signal, triggering her sense of caution, but she couldn’t figure out what it was. She hurriedly tried to speak.</p>
<p>“Well, um, I mean, it’s not… I don’t remember…”</p>
<p>“Your expression contradicts your claim of not remembering.”</p>
<p>With a composed but persistent gaze, he scanned her carefully and spoke decisively. His large hand brushed her forehead and then cradled the back of her head. His fingertips parted her lush blonde hair, lightly touching her scalp.</p>
