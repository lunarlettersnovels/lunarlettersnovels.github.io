            <p><strong>Chapter 80.2</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine’s small voice quietly echoed in the space. Richard, frozen like ice, stared blankly ahead. He recalled Jasmine, tear-filled eyes, angrily asking why he hadn’t discussed something important with her.</p>
<p>Her words felt directed at him now. His clenched fists turned pale.</p>
<p>This time, even Sir Soyer didn’t respond sarcastically or defensively. His eyes, full of thoughts, made Jasmine sigh and stand up.</p>
<p>“I’ve said all I can. As a third party, what can I do?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But I hope you can have an honest conversation with Marian now. She’s been struggling a lot, too.”</p>
<p>At her final words, a cold face momentarily softened with a pang of guilt. Hopefully, it was genuine concern and affection.</p>
<p>They left the infirmary. The sky was blue, and the autumn day was cool, yet the atmosphere was silent and still. Jasmine, replaying the conversation in her mind, suddenly frowned and muttered. The more she thought about it, the more nothing fit perfectly or made sense.</p>
<p>“Could it be an incurable disease?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that.”</p>
<p>Richard’s immediate denial made Jasmine glance at him silently as they walked side by side.</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“I just asked Sir Salinger. He assured me of that.”</p>
<p>Sir Salinger, the tall, intelligent military doctor with a gentle demeanor, glasses, and a white coat that suited him perfectly, was her brother Caras’s old friend.</p>
<p>Despite her subtle probing about Soyer, he only smiled awkwardly and gave no answers. He was friendly but fiercely protective of patient confidentiality.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Lady Jasmine. I can’t say anything about that.”</p>
<p>His polite, firm response left no room for further questioning. His turquoise eyes held the unmistakable resolve typical of doctors. Even Caras admitted he couldn’t push him around. Still, it seemed he had said something to Richard, being his superior.</p>
<p>Jasmine stretched, giving up.</p>
<p>“Ugh, then what the heck is it? Late-onset puberty or early menopause?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Richard suddenly asked,</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“This thing called boredom—have you ever felt it?”</p>
<p>It was an out-of-the-blue question. It seemed inappropriate for him to ask. Unsure of how to respond, Jasmine shrugged lightly under his earnest gaze.</p>
<p>“Well, I haven’t had a relationship deep enough for my emotions to be that drained.”</p>
<p>Of course, that ‘not-so-deep relationship’ included Richard. They both caught the hidden implication in her words. A brief silence followed. This time, Jasmine asked the question.</p>
<p>“What about you, Duke?”</p>
<p>Richard chuckled softly.</p>
<p>“I haven’t liked anyone enough to the point of boredom. Except for you.”</p>
<p>Jasmine stopped in her tracks, but he offered no further explanation. Instead, he turned to look down at her gently.</p>
<p>“If someone could tell me how to get tired of someone, that would be great.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I could really use that, this so-called boredom.”</p>
<p>His persistent blue eyes and the blue sky above him matched like stained glass, shimmering together. She’d thought it before, but his eyes were unnecessarily dazzlingly blue. They could easily captivate someone.</p>
<p>Jasmine responded calmly on the surface.</p>
<p>“It’s better not to know about such things.”</p>
<p>As if it were something desirable.</p>
<p>“Thanks for your help today. Goodbye.”</p>
<p>Just as Jasmine turned to leave, a quiet call came from behind. Jasmine.</p>
<p>The voice was clear and tender, making her internal vows to ignore it seem pointless.</p>
<p>She almost sighed. Why did his voice still affect her after half a year?</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>He was standing right behind her, closer than before. She could sense his presence, his breath, his scent—all very close. If she turned her head, their lips, their eyes would meet just like that. She took a quick or perhaps overly slow breath and licked her lips.</p>
<p>She hesitated, feeling his long, elegant fingers almost grazing the back of her hand, hovering nearby. His hesitation and inner conflict were palpable in his movements. Like a timid butterfly fluttering around.</p>
<p>But as Jasmine bit her lip, unable to bear it any longer and about to turn around, the cowardly butterfly fled with a shallow sigh.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>I’ve overstepped again.</p>
<p>Richard whispered in a hoarse voice before quickly walking past her.</p>
<p>Left alone, Jasmine stood still, watching his retreating figure.</p>
<p>Her neatly folded hands felt empty.</p>
