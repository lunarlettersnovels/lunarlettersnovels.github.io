            <h3>Chapter 76.2</h3>
<p>Silence resumed. Feeling she had said enough, Jasmine refrained from speaking further, and Richard dutifully guided her, though internally, he was in turmoil.</p>
<p>He felt like he was losing his mind.</p>
<p>Holy. How did they used to converse before?</p>
<p>Richard was flustered. He had never found social conversation so difficult. As a noble, engaging in polite and cultured dialogue was second nature to him. Even while distracted, he could manage it effortlessly.</p>
<p>Casual chats were as natural as tea after dinner.</p>
<p>Moreover, conversations with Jasmine were always comfortable and enjoyable. They talked endlessly, even without a specific topic. However, ever since he became aware of his feelings, meeting Jasmine’s eyes after a few days left his mind blank.</p>
<p>Only one thought persisted.</p>
<p>Was she always this beautiful?</p>
<p>Though it seemed strange to be struck anew by her beauty, Richard’s mouth went dry at the sight of Jasmine.</p>
<p>Her abundant blonde hair cascading over her slender shoulders sparkled like sunlight on a river, and her doll-like white face gleamed like a pearl.</p>
<p>Her clear, violet eyes, framed by long lashes, looked as mysterious and enchanting as a fairy’s. Jasmine was not a conventional beauty like Jillian; her rounded forehead, heart-shaped face, deep dimples when she smiled, and large eyes gave her a youthful, lovable charm.</p>
<p>Her slender neck and the serene atmosphere she exuded prevented her from looking merely childlike. Her high nose, particularly full red lips, a beauty mark on her cheek, and playful eye smiles added a lively allure. Her slim yet curvaceous figure enhanced this effect.</p>
<p>Even in a simple light blue dress, the flowing fabric outlined her voluptuous form, creating a tantalizing image in Richard’s mind. Her presence was as intoxicating as the fragrance of apple blossoms, making his gaze waver.</p>
<p>He restrained his words. His tongue felt tied, and he struggled to control his impulses. Although he deliberately avoided looking at her, his attention was entirely on Jasmine. Her breath, her blinks, the warmth and softness of her hand—he was acutely aware of it all.</p>
<p>While nervously asking whom she had come to see, Richard was busy stealing glances at her. Her neat eyebrows, soft hair near her ears, and smooth cheeks stirred a burning desire in him.</p>
<p>Why is every little thing about her so beautiful? Why are her cheeks so fair? Jasmine’s smooth skin resembled porcelain, nothing like his sister Risha, who never washed.</p>
<p>Touching her would feel as soft as cream. He knew it well. He had kissed, licked, and caressed her countless times before. Swallowing hard, he furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>Just six months ago, he could touch her whenever and wherever he wanted.</p>
<p>Thinking of this filled him with anguish and regret.</p>
<p>‘She was mine. She came to me first and gave herself completely. From head to toe, she was all mine…’</p>
<p>“Duke Aion?”</p>
<p>If he could touch and kiss her just once, his wish would be fulfilled.</p>
<p>“Duke Aion!”</p>
<p>Would a cheek kiss suffice? Sometimes, even greetings involved kisses.</p>
<p>Lost in these thoughts, he started at the hand shaking his arm. Jasmine pulled her hand back, puzzled. His sharp blue eyes fixed on her retreating hand like a predator losing its prey.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve arrived.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Richard felt a pang of disappointment. The vast military headquarters now felt suffocatingly small.</p>
<p>He glanced at the White Knights’s banner flapping in the breeze and asked,</p>
<p>“Do you know the way to the commander’s office?”</p>
<p>“No, this is my first time here.”</p>
<p>“Then follow me.”</p>
<p>Jasmine quietly followed him, grateful that it wasn’t as unbearably uncomfortable as she had feared, perhaps because she had mentally prepared herself to remain composed after their last meeting.</p>
<p>Although the military headquarters was a confusing labyrinthe pentagon, the basic layout was similar, making it manageable.</p>
<p>As she trailed behind Richard, Jasmine suddenly stopped. Inspecting the tree-lined window, she grabbed his sleeve and lowered her voice.</p>
<p>“Can you tell which of these windows is the commander’s office?”</p>
<p>“I can roughly tell. Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“Point it out. Quickly.”</p>
<p>She shook his sleeve again. Richard glanced over, then looked straight ahead, feigning indifference.</p>
<p>“Probably over there… Jasmine?”</p>
<p>Jasmine dashed towards the indicated window, and Richard instinctively followed her.</p>
<p>She crouched by the wall, peering inside like a suspicious spy. Richard found himself distracted by her graceful neck and cute posture. He snapped out of his daze with a sense of self-consciousness.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
