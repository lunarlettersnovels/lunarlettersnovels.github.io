            <p><strong>Chapter 79.2</strong></p>
<p>“There could be a meeting place between home and work. If the route is consistent, it would seem natural. With plausible excuses and enough time, it’s possible. Buying flowers for his wife, stopping at a bakery—if he’s not foolish, he’d have a solid alibi. …Why are you looking at me like that?”</p>
<p>“It’s just…the Duke is quite good at speculating about these things.”</p>
<p>Seeing the odd look in Jasmine’s eyes, Richard scowled.</p>
<p>“I would never do something so sleazy.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say you would.”</p>
<p>“But you’re looking at me like that.”</p>
<p>“It’s strange. You seem guilty for no reason.”</p>
<p>Her smile was infuriatingly pretty. Richard sighed and turned away, imagining lightly biting her rosy cheeks. Suddenly, the sight of that tiny face made him lose all will.</p>
<p>“Let’s drop it.”</p>
<p>“Just teasing. I know you’d never do that.”</p>
<p>That’s why I liked you for so long. Jasmine smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“Glad to hear that.”</p>
<p>Richard spoke softly after a moment of silence. Watching her, he stood up. Luckily, his lower body had cooled off.</p>
<p>“We should get going. If we get caught here, it’ll look ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“You’re coming with me?”</p>
<p>Jasmine stood up, surprised, and Richard adjusted his tie, answering,</p>
<p>“After coming all this way, you’re not just going to send me off, are you?”</p>
<p>“I feel bad for making a busy man go through this.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t busy at all. Even if he were, he would have dropped everything to be here. When else could he use the fruits of his hard work?</p>
<p>“Besides, I’m curious now, too.”</p>
<p>Curious about how deep his feelings for her could grow, how long he could endure, Richard found himself genuinely intrigued in that moment.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“What brings you here?”</p>
<p>Soyer, who was resting in the infirmary, couldn’t hide his unease as he saw Richard and Jasmine enter. His complexion, already pale and gaunt from the previous day’s tumultuous visit to the Grand Duke’s estate, looked even more haggard in the stark light of this sterile room.</p>
<p>The stress must be getting to him. Jasmine, observing him carefully, sat gracefully on the chair Richard pulled out for her, crossing her legs. Richard, glancing at her briefly, gestured to the burly medic as if he owned the place, instructing him to bring a blanket.</p>
<p>He then made sure that a warm blanket covered Jasmine’s knees while the tense conversation between the ailing Soyer and Jasmine, under the guise of pleasantries, unfolded.</p>
<p>“I heard you were unwell. Are you feeling better?”</p>
<p>“If I were fine, I wouldn’t be lying here, would I?”</p>
<p>Soyer retorted coldly, and Jasmine responded with a gentle smile. Such snide remarks were hardly enough to faze a socialite queen like her.</p>
<p>“From the way you’re speaking, it doesn’t seem too serious. That’s a relief. What’s the diagnosis? I should inform Marian.”</p>
<p>“Did you come all the way here just to check on me?”</p>
<p>His dry tone was laced with sarcasm, and he was particularly sensitive to Marian’s name. Jasmine raised her hands, indicating she had no intention of quarreling.</p>
<p>“I felt we didn’t have an honest conversation yesterday. Both you and I are closest to Marian, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Soyer leaned back against the high pillow, letting out a shallow sigh. His pallid face, with dark circles under his eyes, looked even more lifeless. His weary and complicated gaze spoke volumes as if he was truly sick.</p>
<p>Jasmine, contemplating his worn-out appearance, cautiously asked,</p>
<p>“Sir Soyer, are you sleeping well?”</p>
<p>Considering he was alone in an empty house with his wife and son gone, it must have been hard for him to sleep peacefully. If it were Jasmine, she would have moved out to a boutique hotel or stayed with friends long ago.</p>
<p>Knowing his sensitive, chihuahua-like temperament from Marian’s constant complaints, which were also expressions of affection, Jasmine felt a fleeting, almost imperceptible twinge of pity for him.</p>
<p>Just a speck, like an ant’s leg.</p>
<p>“But,”</p>
<p>Soyer’s blue eyes, after brushing back his silver hair, turned to Richard, who was standing with his arms crossed, observing the scene.</p>
<p>“What brings you here, Your Grace?”</p>
<p>While Jasmine’s sudden appearance could be brushed off, Soyer was clearly startled by Richard’s presence. He attempted to salute, but Richard raised a hand to stop him, offering no further explanation. He merely nodded slightly in greeting.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while, Count. How have you been? Seeing you in person feels different than on paper.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your congratulations on both the victory and the promotion.”</p>
<p>Despite his words of congratulation, Soyer’s face remained expressionless, like a puppet speaking. His indifference bordered on apathy, yet Richard, accustomed to this as a superior, simply nodded.</p>
<p>“Thank you. We missed you in the last war. Your absence was palpable. I understand you’re interested in promotions, but are you still not willing to participate in prolonged battles?”</p>
<p>“If the country needs me, how can I refuse? I just believe there are many others who can take my place.”</p>
<p>Soyer responded as if reading from a script, a reply so familiar that it wasn’t surprising. Richard nodded as if he had said it just to say it.</p>
<p>“You must not like being far from home. I understand.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Soyer didn’t respond, but Jasmine glanced at him with renewed curiosity. She hadn’t known he was so fixated on his career.</p>
<p>Marian had often complained about how he overworked himself. Honestly, for someone like Sir Soyer, being obsessed with promotions didn’t seem out of character.</p>
