            <p><strong>Chapter 22.1</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine’s stomach felt like it was about to burst. Richard briefly pursued his lips as she gasped and lowered her head beneath him. It felt like she was being torn apart, and the pit of her stomach burned relentlessly.</p>
<p>She futilely attempted to crawl forward, but the man behind her pressed her thighs tightly against his, giving her no room to escape. As he went deeper, Jasmine began to whimper.</p>
<p>“It hurts. Ah, it’s too much. So deep.”</p>
<p>“It’ll get better. Just a bit… ah.”</p>
<p>At the mounting pleasure, Richard’s forehead was covered in sweat. It was a mix of slight pain and ecstasy.</p>
<p>He marveled at his restraint. How he was able to hold Jasmine firmly and move slowly and deeply, not thrusting violently like an animal. He might already be committing a filthy act by imagining her screams. His teeth clenched.</p>
<p>Richard cupped Jasmine’s tear-stained cheeks and kissed her gently. His excitement caused his teeth to graze Jasmine’s tender skin, making her softly whimper in protest.</p>
<p>He murmured apologies. Frankly, he had no idea what he was saying. He held her by the curves of her waist, gripped her pelvis, and slowly penetrated deeper. The pleasure shook his entire body.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Hng!”</p>
<p>Overwhelmed, Richard briefly reclined, his gaze fixed on the glistening, sweat-slicked curve of Jasmine’s back. He had never imagined that something so seemingly soft and delicate could prove to be so demanding.</p>
<p>Supporting his upper body, he gripped her waist tightly and thrust his hips. Her whimpering m*ans seemed to indicate that this shallow insertion was to her liking.</p>
<p>But somehow, he still felt inadequate.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>He whispered as he stared into her dilated violet eyes, lost in thought.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>He held her hips steadily and pulled Jasmine within him with a powerful thrust.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s mouth opened, saliva dripping down slowly. It felt as if her body had completely lost control and had become entirely submissive to him. With a fullness that pierced to the very end, her lower abdomen tightened.</p>
<p>His relentless thrusts, rough and persistent, pressed against her butt*cks, and the powerful rhythm made it feel maddening. Her legs trembled slightly from the sheer strength of his penetration. While there was some pain, the strange and unfamiliar sensation sent shivers down her limbs.</p>
<p>In an instant, Richard had fully inserted himself, and he gasped heavily at Jasmine’s tight grip on him. His throbbing c*ck alternated between slow withdrawal and rough penetration. The nectars of their lovemaking spurted like a hot spring, splashing onto his pelvis and test!cles before falling back.</p>
<p>Jasmine was being pounded relentlessly, barely maintaining her position on all fours while he gripped her waist. Her mounds, swollen like round fruits, swayed wildly. Jasmine m*aned loudly at the thrilling pleasure and fear—it felt like she was being transformed into a beast.</p>
<p>His forceful thrusts, his firm grasp of her sensitive peaks, and every sensual movement he made toward her drove her to bliss. As his strength waned, he thrust into her a few times more, and then he grabbed one of her legs and draped it over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Although the motion was rough, Jasmine turned slightly with relative ease. She whimpered as she tightened around his erect length inside her, causing Richard’s sweat-covered cheek to twitch briefly. It was only then that she was able to look into the eyes of the man. Gone was the usual composure. Breathing raggedly, hooded blue eyes, and a sweat-soaked chest.</p>
<p>It was a pure expression of lust.</p>
<p>They locked eyes briefly, their movements resembling the mating rituals of animals. Jasmine’s half-lidded eyes glistened with desire. Richard couldn’t resist bending down, capturing her lips. He held her by the back of her neck as her thighs clung around his muscular hips.</p>
<p>Guided by his hands, Jasmine ascended to her knees, her thoughts a whirlwind, and passionately kissed him. Richard tenderly caressed her back while firmly grasping her b*ttocks, and lifting her upward.</p>
<p>Their lips met and parted, exchanging muted moans, tongues entwining and parting repeatedly.</p>
<p>Engrossed in the kiss, Richard naturally shifted backward and reclined, moving them into an intimate sitting position. Seizing the moment when their lips parted, he thrust deeply once more.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s hips swayed, and she inhaled sharply. Before she could voice that it was too deep, Richard seized her waist against him and rhythmically plunged into her, over and over.</p>
<p>Uncertain of what to do, Jasmine clutched his abs, attempting to support herself against his pounding. As Richard thrust vigorously, she rocked back, desperately clutching his arms and neck. Her ample bosom swayed before him as he gazed intently with darkened eyes.</p>
<p>Her longing gaze, quivering lips, and the opulent cascade of golden hair.</p>
