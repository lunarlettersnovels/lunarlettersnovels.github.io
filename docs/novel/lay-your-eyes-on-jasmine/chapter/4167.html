            <h3>Chapter 97.1</h3>
<p>“Jasmine, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Following the hand that rested on her shoulder, Jasmine looked up to see Marian’s pretty face and smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“You’re here?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve finished unpacking.”</p>
<p>Marian sighed deeply, as if exhausted, and plopped down next to Jasmine. For a moment, they both silently gazed out the window together.</p>
<p>Marian had decided to return home. She sighed deeply and said,</p>
<p>“It’s still unbelievable when I think about it, but I’m going back. The children want to go home, and they want to see their father too.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was Soyer’s visit the other day that solidified her decision.</p>
<p>He had shown up looking gaunt, with a stern expression, and asked to talk. It was the first time he had swallowed his pride in their relationship.</p>
<p>Marian silently watched her husband’s pale face and followed him, and they had a long conversation.</p>
<p>After Soyer left, Marian was quiet and deep in thought for a long time. When asked what happened, she calmly said,</p>
<p>“Just the same old things over and over.”</p>
<p>But she didn’t seem particularly angrier than before. Marian laughed with a snort.</p>
<p>“He just said he was sick from the aftereffects of the war. It’s nothing serious, but he didn’t want to worry anyone and it wasn’t something he was proud of, so he hid it. And now he’s better. Can you believe all that fuss was just for this?”</p>
<p>“What did you respond?”</p>
<p>“I gave him a warning. Told him I would kill him if he left me and Joshua alone.”</p>
<p>Two days later, she said she would go back, and Jasmine nodded.</p>
<p>It seemed that the conclusion of the drug incident was indeed the last of Richard’s three predictions: it was for treatment.</p>
<p>Although Jasmine was curious about what exactly was wrong with him, she suppressed her curiosity. Knowing he was safe was enough.</p>
<p>On the night the couple reunited, while Marian vented her worry disguised as anger, Soyer listened quietly with his head bowed like a child who had done something wrong. Watching them, Jasmine felt as if she’d stolen a glimpse into their own world, one they’d shared for so long.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you can understand each other without saying much. Perhaps they were like that too.</p>
<p>“He said he was sorry.”</p>
<p>Jasmine turned to look at Marian, who had spoken out of the blue. Her profile, with long eyelashes casting shadows, looked tired but also peaceful. The contradictory expression made Jasmine think that it might be one aspect of relationships between men and women.</p>
<p>“He didn’t give any convincing explanation. Just asked me to believe him. Said he never intended to hurt or betray me. That he still lives every day with the words he said when he proposed engraved in his heart.”</p>
<p>Marian muttered expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Still, he said he was sorry for making me doubt him.”</p>
<p>Jasmine let out a self-deprecating laugh.</p>
<p>“Why can’t they just do things right from the start? It would be so much better.”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” Marian replied cynically, tilting her mug of milk tea. Jasmine, resting her cheek on her hand, tidied her friend’s stray hair and asked,</p>
<p>“So, did your heart soften a bit?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. In marriage, even if things don’t get resolved, you just live with it. You think, ‘Why did I marry this wretch? I must have been crazy,’ but you still end up growing old together, through all the ups and downs.”</p>
<p>Though her tone was lamenting, Jasmine found it curious why the phrase “growing old together” sounded warm to her. She decided to ignore the hollow feeling in her heart and asked playfully.</p>
<p>“So, what did Sir Soyer say when he proposed?”</p>
<p>“What do you think? Just the usual stuff.”</p>
<p>Marian mumbled, trying to avoid the question. But Jasmine, noticing her reddened ears, felt she knew what he had said. She was relieved.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s good that you made up.”</p>
<p>“Made up, my foot. But what about you?”</p>
<p>“What about me?”</p>
<p>Marian’s eyes narrowed at Jasmine’s puzzled expression.</p>
<p>“Your Iron Duke. Isn’t he the reason you’ve been so troubled lately?”</p>
<p>You can’t hide things from your sister, you know. Marian warned, but Jasmine only smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. My heart is just complicated.”</p>
<p>The situation was too. Jasmine thought of Richard, who hadn’t contacted her since that day.</p>
<p>It was awkward, but considering Sir Soyer’s situation, she had sent a letter after much deliberation a few days ago, yet there had been no reply.</p>
<p>Is he busy? Even so, after being so close during this ordeal, he could at least send a simple message.</p>
<p>He acted like he was so in love, but now that he’s out of touch, a part of her felt empty and slightly irritated.</p>
<p>She knew she would feel uncomfortable if he showed up, yet these mixed emotions were frustrating. Jasmine was no longer angry at her own selfish, childish feelings.</p>
<p>She thought she should be used to it by now, but each time, she felt a sense of self-reproach. Marian, who had been watching her sigh deeply, reached out and gently hugged her shoulder.</p>
<p>The firm warmth was somewhat comforting, and Jasmine placed her hand on Marian’s and leaned her head on her friend’s slender but strong shoulder.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“When your heart is complicated, as long as it doesn’t ruin your life, just follow your heart.”</p>
<p>The sound of Marian sipping her hot tea echoed above her head. With the warm steam, Marian’s calm voice resonated.</p>
