            <h3>Chapter 83.2</h3>
<p>As she paid for her books and left the store, Jasmine kept thinking about the mysterious woman. The conversation with her, who was strikingly unique and peculiar in many ways, lingered in her mind. But the real reason Jasmine was so fixated on her was one thing.</p>
<p>The fleeting smile that briefly crossed her white face. It was strange. She thought it was the first time they had met, but seeing her smile felt oddly familiar. Who is she, really?</p>
<p>“Is she perhaps a distant relative of some noble family, visiting the capital for a while?”</p>
<p>That face…</p>
<p>“I definitely saw her somewhere.”</p>
<p>With her experience in the social circles, Jasmine had memorized the faces, names, and families of all the major figures in the empire. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say she had the family trees of noble houses in her head. But she just couldn’t place her.</p>
<p>More than not knowing, it was the blue eyes and the pretty, girlish smile that changed her cold demeanor when she smiled that kept nagging at her. You know, the type whose atmosphere and impression change completely when they smile despite usually being cold. It was charming. Maybe that’s why?</p>
<p>As she pondered, Jasmine came to a halt.</p>
<p>She quickly looked around.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, she was standing on busy 5th Street in front of the third bridge over the Reitias River, which divides the capital’s southern and northern parts.</p>
<p>She frowned and looked around. A woman selling apples, a coachman haggling over fares, a general store, a gentleman feeding pigeons, and freight wagons quickly passing.</p>
<p>It was an ordinary afternoon scene in the capital. Jasmine tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>‘Strange. I felt like someone was watching me just now…’</p>
<p>‘Was it my imagination?’</p>
<p>Just then, the clock tower in the square chimed, indicating it was 3 o’clock. As if an alarm had gone off, Jasmine suddenly remembered. Perhaps it was because she noticed a small bakery with a line forming in the distance.</p>
<p>“Have you ever been to Watt’s Bakery on 5th Avenue Gerante?”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, this is 5th Avenue Gerante.”</p>
<p>How did I end up here? Lost in thought, she had leisurely walked for about 20 minutes. Jasmine scratched her cheek and impulsively joined the line of people.</p>
<p>She could ask a maid to get it later, but today, she wanted to buy and taste it herself since she was already here. She had plenty of time. She might as well try it now.</p>
<p>“At 3 o’clock, fresh bread and cookies come out, and they taste amazing. You should try them.”</p>
<p>How delicious must they be for her to mention it so suddenly? But just in case, Jasmine craned her neck to look around, but the woman with the silver-gray hair was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Well, given her tall and slender figure and unique hair color, she would have stood out immediately if she were nearby. Jasmine scratched her cheek again and then waited comfortably, observing her surroundings as the line slowly moved forward.</p>
<p>Indeed, there was quite a variety of people in line, suggesting it was a popular spot. Jasmine chuckled along with the others as they watched a man get kicked out for trying to cut in line, but then she shivered again with a sense of unease.</p>
<p>‘Again. What is this feeling?’</p>
<p>It felt like someone was staring intently at her. She was used to receiving attention, but this felt different. It was unsettling and unpleasant.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, miss?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“It’s your turn.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Jasmine thanked the person and stepped into the bakery, picking up a bread basket. As the rich, sweet smell of bread filled her lungs, her suspicious feelings quickly dissipated, and she felt better.</p>
<p>There were apple pies topped with sweetly stewed apples and cinnamon, yellow madeleines, colorful macarons, chewy chocolate cakes, and thick Basque cheesecakes loaded with cheese.</p>
<p>After some deliberation, Jasmine chose a Basque cheesecake, a plain white bread, and a mocha bread with a cracked top like a turtle’s shell.</p>
<p>‘Wow, these look delicious. I’ll have them with tea when I get home.’</p>
<p>She also tried a piece of cream bread that was offered as a sample. Delicious! It wasn’t too sweet, with a refreshing and savory taste that suggested high-quality milk was used. While the bread made by the mansion’s patissier was excellent, the bread from this shop had a different kind of charm.</p>
<p>The lightly sweetened bread with less expensive sugar suited her taste better. Jasmine smacked her lips and picked up another piece, then added three more of the same cream bread to her basket.</p>
<p>“Miss, you should take a bread roll too. It’s the best in this shop.”</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you.”</p>
<p>A kind-hearted elderly woman smiled warmly and offered her the bread. Jasmine smiled happily and expressed her gratitude. Feeling thoroughly cheered up, Jasmine paid for her purchases and stepped outside.</p>
<p>‘It’s about time to head home. I might have bought too much in my excitement, but we can all share it.’ As she thought this, Jasmine stumbled slightly in the bustling crowd. One of the round bread rolls sticking out of the bag fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>What a waste! That was the bread the kind grandmother had generously offered! As Jasmine fretted, someone swiftly caught the bread before it hit the ground. Her purple eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>“Wow, thank you….”</p>
<p>And then she was at a loss for words. Her gaze followed him as he straightened up. Jet-black hair, sea-blue eyes, and firmly set lips.</p>
<p>Richard had an unreadable expression. However, his eyes were constantly following her every small movement.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Then he smiled brightly. Ah. Jasmine almost forgot to breathe for a moment and quickly averted her gaze, struggling to regain her composure.</p>
