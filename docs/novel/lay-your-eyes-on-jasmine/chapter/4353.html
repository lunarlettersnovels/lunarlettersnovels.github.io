            <p><b>Chapter 3.1</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m so irritated.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m so irritated, I’m so irritated, I’m so irritated!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine held her breath and slipped away from the scene, arriving home with feeble steps. Even in the face of her family’s worried inquiries about what was wrong, she shook her head nervously and locked her door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, she began to pound a large teddy bear with her fist. Otherwise, it felt like she’d rip her hair out and cry like a fool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From within, a buildup of sorrow and resentment from a long unrequited love and the frustration of Richard being in love with the wrong woman in this nonsensical love triangle surged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anger and jealousy toward a woman she didn’t even know were present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would’ve been so much better when she mistakenly thought Richard was an impenetrable wall uninterested in women.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh my goodness. Richard has a crush!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who on earth is the girl? How amazing must she be!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her frustration and resentment surged, making her feel so pathetic that tears welled up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cotton of the teddy bear, which she had vigorously pounded with her fist in her passionate anger, had become lumpy and flat, yet Jasmine remained melancholic and angry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was not the kind of challenge that could be overcome by putting in an effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before she started liking Richard, Jasmine had been one of the happiest girls in the world, if not the happiest – always enjoying delicious food, playing around, laughing with her brothers, basking in her parents’ love and affection, and her biggest concern was what she would do tomorrow and what snacks she would eat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But suddenly, she found herself relentlessly striving and sitting amidst the elite of the social circle, infatuated with an exceedingly handsome and accomplished guy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t what the cultured and refined lady that Jasmine had initially desired. She was much simpler and more emotionally honest than how others perceived her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She gave up on her beloved chocolates, switched to tasteless vegetable juices with salads, exchanged giggles for ballet, and traded romance novels she used to read for scholarly books, all to train herself over those seven years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After puberty, Jasmine’s life wasn’t just about having a crush on Richard; it was more than that. It had turned her life upside down, affecting her direction and identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like telling a student who had shed sweat and tears to earn their diploma, “Sorry, but you’ve failed. Maybe you won’t even graduate even if you try again. Want to transfer schools? Or maybe drop out?” It was as if her efforts were being stepped on and crushed, leaving her feeling worthless. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t even have the right to be angry because her feelings were </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-sided</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like trampling on her dignity and everything else. It felt like becoming a miserable, insignificant person. That’s how unrequited love was. Just the existence of someone who didn’t even care about her existence could erode her self-esteem like ants eating away at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine lay down on her side, hugging the teddy bear crumpled up like a bread roll as she absorbed the emotional blows for a while. ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This teddy bear and me. We both seemed equally unable and despondent.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lost in thought, she absentmindedly stared at the empty air. After a while, when her youngest sibling’s concern and the knocks from her mother and older siblings, who had left after their worries, finally reached her, Jasmine regained her senses and murmured unintentionally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I should stop this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first time. Over those seven years, despite liking him so much that it made her sick, and despite feeling doubt, she had never thought of giving up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about her situation now, it was remarkable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She, who had never put effort into anything consistently, had been so fervently, almost religiously, devoted to one person. Why did she like him so much, as if he was the best thing in the world, even though he showed no interest in her? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine’s past, where she had brushed aside everything as unimportant and laughed it off, seemed trivial compared to this serious and profound impression. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seriously, this was strange. Why is he so wonderful? Unrequited love might last a year or two, but seven years? Isn’t that excessive? What’s wrong with you, Jasmine? Don’t you have any self-respect?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it’s because he’s the most amazing and radiant person.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he’s responsible and capable, which is excellent.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">His gentlemanly qualities, and at the same time, his subtle stubbornness, his straightforwardness when he’s angry, it’s all charming in a unique way…</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why am I like this?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine blushed again and felt self-reproach. Wasn’t this a bit beyond normal? What should she do? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can she ever end this tiresome one-sided love? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if she continues like this for a lifetime? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if he still has no interest in her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt melancholic. Why did God bestow such a trial upon her, when she lived a kind and happy life? Shouldn’t He at least have spared her from this ordeal?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her tears started to well up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything is too complicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wanted to just give up on everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, resentment towards that woman had eclipsed her feelings for Richard. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did you have to be so amazing, handsome, and perfect that you stole my heart? Couldn’t you have been a bit less attractive? A bit more foolish or vain? Why did it have to be me? Why me?!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t want to love you.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone as cold and indifferent as you…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I miss you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine’s eyes welled up with tears. She despised this side of herself. She found it pathetic. But what could she do? Her heart wasn’t following her lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does he even know my name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, tears streamed down uncontrollably, and that night, Jasmine sobbed her heart out until dawn broke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staring at the window as the first light of day crept in, she made a resolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, she was determined to sever this stubborn unrequited love.</span></p>
