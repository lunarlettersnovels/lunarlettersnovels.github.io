            <p><strong>Chapter 39.1</strong></p>
<p>“No way…”</p>
<p>However, as Jasmine gradually recalled the memory, she wondered if there was something to this and rubbed her cheek roughly.</p>
<p>He continued spending time with her after they had s!ex. He paid attention to her, expressed his affection, and complimented only her.</p>
<p>A man who used to be so indifferent now smiled whenever he looked at her.</p>
<p>He wanted to do everything for her, expressed his fondness openly in front of everyone, and declared our relationship officially.</p>
<p>When Jasmine mentioned that she didn’t like a relationship just for sleeping, he immediately agreed.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t it clear that he likes me?  Isn’t it? It’s not my imagination, right?</em></p>
<p>Until now, Jasmine thought Richard liked her because of some sense of responsibility after sleeping together. However, Richard clearly expressed his feelings to Jasmine, not hesitating to reveal his emotions. He did it aggressively no wonder she was slightly confused.</p>
<p>Would a usually indifferent person go to such lengths? Even if she lightly touched him, the response came back doubled. Jasmine, who thought she could gradually build it up, found it overwhelming.</p>
<p>The lady turned into a human rose, and the petals swelled so much that they were on the verge of bursting.</p>
<p><em>Oh, my heart is in trouble. I don’t know. For now, I just miss Richard too much.</em></p>
<p>Jasmine pressed her fluttering heart and hastened her steps. She initially thought about going to the flower garden and asking any passerby if they had seen Duke Aion.</p>
<p>It was by coincidence that she passed by the Prince’s library while in haste.</p>
<p>“… I’m worried that the timing is too rushed,</p>
<p>She overheard the conversation between the Crown Prince and Richard through then open crack in the door.</p>
<p>“Although I need the Grand Duchy Liovanni, it’s not urgent enough for me to risk your life. If you end up like His Majesty and your mother, how can you look at your late uncle?”</p>
<p><em>What is he talking about?</em></p>
<p>Jasmine’s nerves tensed at the mention of her family name. Her father, an influential noble in the south, was friendly to the emperor and respected by many nobles, but he was never a person to seek political power. He was modest and had little interest in power.</p>
<p>However, Jilian’s words made it seem like he was discussing a political marriage…</p>
<p>The only daughter in the Liovanni family who could marry Richard was Jasmine.</p>
<p>As Jasmine’s expression became peculiar with a strange intuition, the voice of the person she was looking for rang out.</p>
<p>With his casual tone, Jasmine was at a loss for what to do. It felt very strange. It was as if she had encountered someone with the same face as the person she thought she knew well but was a stranger.</p>
<p>“It’s not simply because of Your Majesty’s request.”</p>
<p>“Of course. I know you won’t do something you don’t like. Fortunately, she seems to like you, too.”</p>
<p><em>… not simply because of Your Majesty’s request. Fortunately, she seems to like you, too.</em></p>
<p>Despite the friendly atmosphere and words. Jasmine felt shivered. As the person involved, she had not known at all.</p>
<p>Jasmine did not know that other things could come into play between the affection and the relationship they would develop in the future. She was hurt, embarrassed, and…</p>
<p>She didn’t know. Was it because the situation was somewhat similar?</p>
<p>Suddenly, she remembered the incident a few days ago when Charles’s friends gossiped about her.</p>
<p>And she was even more surprised. Jasmine never imagined that Richard could be involved in such a ‘situation’ that made her uncomfortable and uneasy.</p>
<p>But despite Jasmine’s reddened and pale cheeks, the conversation continued.</p>
<p>“So? Are you going to the Royal Capital?”</p>
<p>“I have to get Jasmine’s permission. She might be embarrassed if I suddenly proposed.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad she knows how to be embarrassed.”</p>
<p>At the mention of a proposal, Jasmine became even more dumbfounded. She hadn’t thought about anything after that. She didn’t know how she returned to the bedroom with such a state of mind.</p>
<p>She glanced weakly at the cold food and then crawled into bed. Her head felt dizzy and complicated with tangled thoughts.</p>
<p>It seemed like she had a slight fever. Jasmine had a naturally robust constitution, but occasionally, when she experienced psychological shocks or became unusually sensitive, she would suffer from a mild illness.</p>
<p>She hadn’t experienced this since she was a child.</p>
<p>As she curled under the blanket, a bitter laugh burst from her. It wasn’t like her. Until just before leaving this room, the world seemed pink. No, it started with that. It felt like the rose about to bloom was trampled on before it could fully open.</p>
<p>Should she have just stayed in this room? Then she wouldn’t have known anything.</p>
<p>Jasmine thought and thought again while trapped in the dim place.</p>
<p>So, she knew that the Crown Prince wanted the best for her and Richard. He revealed it openly, so there’s no way she didn’t know.</p>
<p>But she didn’t know that he requested it. She knew that Richard was the Crown Prince’s only relative and the most reliable confidant of the imperial family. But she didn’t know it would affect his private life, their relationship, and even his marriage.</p>
