            <p><strong>Chapter 29.2</strong></p>
<p>The Prince’s head tilted quizzically as he read the complex emotions in Richard’s eyes.</p>
<p>“What’s this? You’ve been telling me to make progress, but have you changed your mind all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. You pretended to be proper, but it seems like you’re also a man, huh?”</p>
<p>‘<em>They had been exchanging subtle glances at each meal as if they were a pair of passionate young lovers, hadn’t they?</em>’ Jilian thought. He had teased them a bit. Still, this guy pretended to be uninterested.</p>
<p>Jilian clicked his tongue while glancing at his cousin, who calmly averted his gaze. An audacious man. He acted the same way now as he did before.</p>
<p>“Rein it in a bit. If you don’t intend to play around for a while, you should know how to take it slowly.”</p>
<p><em>‘I do. I’m trying. It’s just not working out well.’</em></p>
<p>Richard, too, was so deeply infatuated with Jasmine that he was wholeheartedly lost in the physical pleasure she provided. He was almost embarrassed.</p>
<p>After caressing her body, which had fallen limp after several intense encounters, he finally regained his composure and let out a bitter laugh. He felt an odd affection for this vulnerable woman who had clung to him so helplessly.</p>
<p>It was true that he was even more aroused by how her body surrendered to him. Jasmine may not have been aware of it, but Richard would embrace her sleeping form.</p>
<p>He was at a loss whether the thing panting and arching its back with a gentle face was an animal or a human. But he had no desire to quit. This made him utterly crazy with lu!st.</p>
<p>It bothered him, wondering if he had always been this lu!stful, but every time their eyes met, his lower half was already stiff. Looking at her moist lips made him imagine the kisses they had shared and her sweet voice m0aning and screaming in pleasure under him. He found it hard to control himself.</p>
<p>Above all, she seemed to want him so much and gazed at him with pleading eyes. What man in the world could resist such a sweet look?</p>
<p>Her intense desire for him was the most potent aphrodisiac of all. Jasmine—a woman with a sweet nectar that attracts bees. No one knew that side hidden behind her cute, innocent face.</p>
<p>His facial expressions weren’t under control, so he focused his gaze on the greenery before them.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s messy face, sobbing and whimpering and filled with his cu!m soon came to mind. The rabbit-like woman cried so loudly when she was touched too much.</p>
<p>Her ample, plump butt0cks, generous bre@sts, round shoulders, and flushed nose and eyes—whenever he looked at them, he wanted to mess her up, to taint her even more. And when he saw her raising her hips, her slender waist twisting, begging for more, saliva would gather in his mouth, and his eyes would roll.</p>
<p>How could a woman like her exist? Everything was so perfect.</p>
<p>Her cheerful and unpretentious personality, her impressive knowledge in various fields, her level of culture, her hobbies and interests, her adorable face—which he hadn’t noticed before— and her petite figure that fit perfectly in his arms…</p>
<p>Her fair bod, which she offered eagerly, legs open, nectar dripping, and her voice m0aning with want, how could he run from that?  Her excellent physical stamina and sturdy build could match his rough sexual preferences. They could even enjoy activities like fishing and horseback riding together.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s lineage and Richard’s background, which held prominent positions in various fields, were a match. It was appropriate, and both families were faultless. A wedding would benefit them.</p>
<p>It was like God had crafted her to be his perfect bride. He was almost dizzy, wondering how things would have been if she hadn’t liked him first.</p>
<p>As time went on with Jasmine, Richard was increasingly sure she was his ideal match, even to the point of thinking of marriage.</p>
<p>No, the determination to take responsibility for her had already formed in his mind when he saw Jasmine turn red with panic the following day of their lovemaking.</p>
<p>And so they made love again… as if to brand his mark of ownership on her. The more he learned about her, the more solid the picture of their future became. Yes, everything felt natural and preordained.</p>
<p>Although there had been discussions earlier, and he had pretty much rejected her. He was prepared for if the Duke would resent him. The biggest mountain of their relationship at this point might be that much.</p>
<p>However, they were not even engaged, and their physical intimacy was excessive. They needed to be careful from today onwards.</p>
<p>But hell, how could he resist touching her gorgeous and alluring body? In such a beautiful summer in this wonderful vacation spot?</p>
<p>“I am making an effort.”</p>
<p>Richard mumbled almost painfully, and the Crown Prince didn’t insist further and only clicked his tongue before moving ahead. Following him, Richard soon noticed Jasmine on a white horse, dressed in riding attire and conversing with other noblemen and ladies.</p>
