            <p><strong>Chapter 56.1</strong></p>
<p>The clear autumn sky was azure. It had rained overnight, and the bright light and the damp grass looked eerily cold. It was the last day of fall.</p>
<p>Shade fell beneath Jasmine’s blonde lashes as she looked down at the red leaves piled high beneath her horse’s hooves. A cool breeze ruffled her hair, revealing her fair cheeks, and James, riding beside her, suddenly thought,</p>
<p>‘My little sister, but she’s getting more beautiful by the day. Well, she was always beautiful, but…’</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, her demeanor had changed. She used to be chubby, lively, and adorable, like a cheerful yellow rose, but lately—as if she were autumn, she exuded a mature and alluring aura—like a moist, fragrant red rose in full bloom.</p>
<p>Jasmine seemed to have become more contemplative and elegant. She used to give off a girlish vibe, but now she had grown into a woman.</p>
<p>James felt proud and happy about it in some ways, but somehow, he also felt sad and concerned about his sister. There was a shadow, unable to be spoken of, that he felt.</p>
<p>When she was in the mood, she would laugh and chat as usual, but when she stayed quiet like now, she seemed like a mysterious beauty with many stories to tell.</p>
<p>James approached Jasmine, clearing his throat unnecessarily.</p>
<p>“We finally came out for an outing together, Jasmine. What’s up?”</p>
<p>Jasmine glanced at him briefly. Her curly hair scattered around her face looked truly charming, making James’ heart sink again.</p>
<p>“Big brother.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Did you bring the hunting rifle? The scenery is beautiful, but it’s kind of boring. Days like this call for some shooting.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“You didn’t bring anything?”</p>
<p>“What’s this? If you invited me, you should have been prepared.”</p>
<p>Jasmine lightly grumbled, tapping the horse’s flank with her booted foot.</p>
<p>As the ash-colored horse started trotting briskly, James, who had been staring absentmindedly at its swaying tail, hurriedly followed.</p>
<p>Yeah, that’s our Jasmine. Full of energy. Hahaha…</p>
<p>“What’s with the hunting? You used to hate it when I suggested.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. But I went again the other day, and it was fun.”</p>
<p>“What? With whom?”</p>
<p>“With Peterson.”</p>
<p>“Peterson? The first, second, or third son of the Peterson family? The third one is a kid, right? So he’s out.”</p>
<p>The mention of a kid made James’ mouth drop open. As far as she knew, the household had three sons.</p>
<p>When Jasmine replied to the questions, her older brother asked if she knew. She always answered every time; there weren’t many secrets between them.</p>
<p>“Since when have you been close to him?”</p>
<p>“Well, about four days ago?”</p>
<p>Despite James’ urgent questioning, Jasmine replied indifferently. She seemed uninterested in his concerns. Becoming more anxious, James asked further.</p>
<p>“Did you two go alone? Without telling your brothers…?”</p>
<p>“Not just the two of us, but four of us. Including Aisha and her new boyfriend.”</p>
<p>“What! That’s a couple date! How long have you known each other?”</p>
<p>“Oh, stop it. I’m not a teenager.”</p>
<p>Finally getting irritated, Jasmine grabbed the reins of her horse. Despite her narrowed eyes, James continued his nagging.</p>
<p>“It’s all because I’m worried about you! How can I not notice the things I keep hearing about these days? I heard the man you just met had dated enough to fill a whole mansion!”</p>
<p>“So what? Did I get a new home or run away out of lovesickness?”</p>
<p>“What, what! Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“If big brother keeps nagging, I might consider it.”</p>
<p>“Hey! Jasmine Liovanni!”</p>
<p>Jasmine giggled mischievously and swiftly rode off like the wind. Left alone, James shook his head in frustration.</p>
<p>‘Why have you changed so much?’</p>
<p>it was probably from that time.</p>
<p>James, recalling Jasmine’s expression when she heard the sudden news of Duke Aion’s sudden participation in the war, let out a faint sigh.</p>
<p>She acted as usual without saying anything, but her family knew she wasn’t as casual as it seemed.</p>
<p>Whatever had happened at the summer villa that year, something big or small had certainly influenced the youngest’s heart.</p>
<p>‘Still, she’s become much brighter these days, so that’s a relief,’ James thought with a bitter smile. ‘So, I’m worried…’</p>
<p>He came to the Imperial Palace today and, after hearing the news from the cabinet meeting, was thinking about Jasmine.</p>
<p>The war with Jiosen, expected to last well over two years, unbelievably ended in just six months.</p>
<p>Not only was there victory, but negotiations for the ceasefire were also progressing smoothly due to the captured prisoners. It was a remarkable achievement, and the Foreign Ministry and the military were abuzz with excitement.</p>
<p>Even His Majesty the Emperor seemed secretly satisfied with Prince Jilian’s excellent leadership. Of course, everyone knew this feat was possible thanks to the capabilities of his strategist, the second-in-command Duke of Iron.</p>
<p>As an aide to the Foreign Secretary, it was also good news for James, but he couldn’t help but feel somewhat uncomfortable when the Duke’s name was mentioned throughout the meeting.</p>
<p>If he were to return to the capital, he would inevitably come across him. He was worried, but… there was nothing he could do. It would happen eventually, and it’s already been half a year.</p>
<p>It’ll be fine, James reassured himself.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“How is it! How is it? It’s a new product. Isn’t it great?!”</p>
<p>Nicky bounced around, grinning broadly. Jasmine laughed at her friend’s cute face but kept a straight face as she opened the perfume bottle.</p>
