            <h3>Chapter 73.2</h3>
<p>Soyer, once a promising son, fell out of favor with his father, and their relationship was nearly severed early in their marriage. Marian had once said she was relieved not to have to see her in-laws, but it couldn’t have been as easy as she made it sound.</p>
<p>In any case, they had relied solely on their love and worked incredibly hard. Everything they had accomplished—the house granted by the emperor, the title, the estate—was the result of their tireless effort together.</p>
<p>But was she really okay? For Marian, her husband and family were everything she had poured her youth into. Jasmine, realizing this, fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p>“Marian, whatever choice you make, I’ll support and believe in you.”</p>
<p>Marian, who had been responding breezily, paused. She understood the depth of Jasmine’s words.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Marian knew that Jasmine’s talk of a fresh start and a lawyer was meant to boost her confidence. She stared at the cucumber she was chewing on.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“What if it’s true? I’m so scared.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“And I hate that as.shole so much it’s driving me crazy.”</p>
<p>Marian rubbed her forehead with trembling hands, gritting her teeth. Jasmine felt she could understand her.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, I can tell just by looking into his eyes if he’s telling the truth or lying.”</p>
<p>Why…</p>
<p>“Why is he pushing me like this? Why is he lying? Why does he keep putting me in these situations? What’s wrong with him?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I wish he’d just tell a believable lie. I’d gladly be fooled.”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s eyes momentarily hardened as she recalled Richard’s bewildered face when he couldn’t answer a question about love. She tried to ignore the pang in her chest.</p>
<p>“Even if he came back smelling of another woman’s perfume—if he said something, I’d believe him. Please.”</p>
<p>“Marian…”</p>
<p>Marian’s hand, clutching the cucumber, snapped it in half. Jasmine covered her hand, which was dripping with tears, and sighed. At times like these, she despised all men.</p>
<p>“I’ve known Sir Soyer for a long time, too. He doesn’t seem like the type to do such things. I think we need to investigate more thoroughly.”</p>
<p>So, what I’m saying is…</p>
<p>“Catch him in the act.”</p>
<p>“Sniffle. The act?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Jasmine nodded firmly.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s to understand the sequence of events or to make any decisions, you need evidence.”</p>
<p>They need evidence. Jasmine once read in a book that having the upper hand is important whether you’re going to divorce or forgive and live together again.</p>
<p>And since Joshua was involved, having more evidence could also protect custody rights. Jasmine, fuming with rage, ground her teeth.</p>
<p>‘That bastard should be treating our Marian like a princess, not taking her for granted! She’s strong, quick-witted, and pretty. How could anyone think she’s not good enough?’</p>
<p>‘If this is true, I’ll make sure he never sets foot in this capital again!’</p>
<p>“To start, we should check his workplace…!”</p>
<p>“Jasmine! There’s a letter for you!”</p>
<p>Oh, wait. Is it a visitor?</p>
<p>Just then, Caras, who had taken the afternoon off and had apparently stopped swinging his sword to come inside, walked into the drawing room, wiping his sweat.</p>
<p>The two women, who had been intensely focused on each other, turned simultaneously to look at Sir Caras, the captain of the Azure Knights.</p>
<p>The corners of Caras’s normally smiling mouth twitched awkwardly under their intense gazes.</p>
<p>“Huh? Why is the atmosphere like this…?”</p>
<p>“Brother.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah?”</p>
<p>“You’re going to the Knights’ Headquarters tomorrow, right? Take me with you.”</p>
<p>“What? Why?”</p>
<p>“Me too! Take me along!”</p>
<p>“What if your husband sees you? I’ll go quickly and come back. I know the layout well.”</p>
<p>Caras glanced between the two women, who were busy whispering to each other, clearly having made up their minds without his input. He scratched his head, then pulled out a chair and reached for a cucumber from the basket, only for Jasmine to smack his hand.</p>
<p>“Wash your hands first! Dirty.”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay.”</p>
<p>As Caras obediently wiped his hands with a handkerchief, Jasmine narrowed her eyes at the initials embroidered on it.</p>
<p>“Brother.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>With his innocent, bear-like face chomping on a cucumber, Jasmine knew he was quite charming outside. As she studied his handsome face, she smiled and asked,</p>
<p>“Are you dating Nicky?”</p>
<p>“Cough! Cough!”</p>
<p>Caras choked, sending bits of cucumber flying. Marian’s eyes widened in interest, and Jasmine sighed as she removed a piece of cucumber from Caras’s lips. It was a good thing he became a knight and not a diplomat.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to answer. I can guess.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Yeah.”</p>
<p>“So, is it okay if I visit the knights’ headquarters tomorrow? Specifically, the White Knights?”</p>
<p>“Since when do you need my permission? But why there?”</p>
<p>Did she know a knight there? As Caras chewed another cucumber, Jasmine shrugged.</p>
<p>“I have some business there. Have you heard any news recently? Especially about Captain Soyer Atlante?”</p>
