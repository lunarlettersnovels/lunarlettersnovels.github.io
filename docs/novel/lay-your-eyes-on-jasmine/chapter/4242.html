            <h3>Chapter 59.1</h3>
<p>“This is my first time to hear it. Where did the Young Lady hear that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, never mind.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know why she asked. Maybe because she suddenly remembered the conversation from before. Or perhaps because she met the soon-to-be bride at the academy.</p>
<p>Risha made a slight clicking noise with her tongue and turned away. Before she could even set foot on the staircase, a commotion started outside.</p>
<p>She and Frank exchanged puzzled glances, and as soon as they looked at the front door, it swung open with a loud noise.</p>
<p>A tall man with a dark blue cloak billowing from behind him entered the path created by the shocked employees who bowed their heads and the vassals who came running in a panic.</p>
<p>With jet-black hair that had grown long enough to cover his neck in the past six months, sun-kissed skin from the southern sun like a tanned pirate, deep eyes, and slightly parted lips exuding a wild aura, he resembled a wild horse.</p>
<p>Despite the raw, manly charm emanating from his sharper jawline and features, Risha couldn’t help but glare at him irritably.</p>
<p>“You’re doing well.”</p>
<p>The Duke Aion went through the crowd without a word, heading towards the staircase with great strides. When he lifted his head, he discovered his stoic sister.</p>
<p>Meeting his blood relative after a long time, Richard tilted his head slightly and said one thing.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Can’t I come to visit?”</p>
<p>Despite her brief sarcasm, Richard didn’t offer any further response. With just a few steps, he soon overtook her and came up to where she was standing on the stairs.</p>
<p>The siblings, reuniting after two years, silently gazed at each other. There was a certain resemblance in their cool demeanor and indifferent expressions, as if they were looking into a mirror.</p>
<p>Richard asked abruptly. “Food?”</p>
<p>“Just arrived,” Risha answered.</p>
<p>“For how long?”</p>
<p>“I’ll see.”</p>
<p>It was like a brief report between a superior and subordinate in the military. And that was the end of their conversation.</p>
<p>Richard nodded curtly, patted Risha’s shoulder lightly, and passed by. Just as Risha was about to go her way, she suddenly grabbed the hem of his coat.</p>
<p>“Lily sends her regards.”</p>
<p>As expected, Richard’s steps stopped abruptly. In fact, Risha was still unfamiliar with and very intrigued by the sight of her non-human brother acting uncharacteristically emotional, so she was curious about his reaction.</p>
<p>However, his blue eyes were simply calm. There was no change except for the faint unfamiliarity as if he had heard the news of an old friend whose name he could barely remember.</p>
<p>Lysha, who was well aware of Richard’s demeanor, was a little surprised, and upon realizing this, she felt relieved once more. What kind of person is she?</p>
<p>Richard nodded in acknowledgment. “Okay.”</p>
<p>Take a breath. She threw it out shortly and turned away again, only to impulsively grab him for a rare second time.</p>
<p>“But, brother, are you getting married?”</p>
<p>The heavy military boots halted once again, but Risha remained nonchalant. This time, his reaction was different. A hint of irritation and bewilderment flashed in his deep blue eyes, and his voice carried a tinge of annoyance.</p>
<p>“What nonsense?”</p>
<p>This way of speaking was more familiar between them. Risha shrugged, feigning indifference to her brother’s disapproving gaze.</p>
<p>“I heard something before. About Lady Liovanni?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Never mind.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was just a baseless rumor after all. It wasn’t particularly surprising. But it was surprising for Richard to be involved in such gossip.</p>
<p>Risha passed by Richard, whose silence was heavier than before. Though his demeanor turned somewhat sullen, she, no longer interested, failed to notice. Then, a harsh voice scratched at her back.</p>
<p>“Risha.”</p>
<p>Turning around abruptly, Risha found Richard staring intently at her. His indifferent blue eyes swept up and down her figure. Suddenly, an ominous feeling crept over her.</p>
<p>“Do you even bathe these days? In the past, you were too absorbed in research to bother cutting your hair. Now that you’ve become a professor, your hair smells like rotten cabbage. Are you planning to farm with your hair?”</p>
<p>“What are you suddenly talking about!”</p>
<p>As Risha snapped back, Richard’s lips curved slightly upwards. It was a familiar expression, one she had seen often. It was his smile when his temper flared, like a mischievous imp rather than a young duke. It sent shivers down her spine involuntarily.</p>
<p>“It stinks like that now.”</p>
<p>Th-this…!</p>
<p>As Risha was about to retort furiously, Richard swiftly approached, tapping her forehead smoothly before passing by.</p>
<p>“Wash yourself. Filthy.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>In the end, Risha could only burst out in anger, but he was already striding away with his long legs. It was so long since she was attacked that she couldn’t retaliate.</p>
<p>Her butler Frank, who watched her as she stamped her feet in frustration, consoled her affectionately.</p>
<p>“It’s alright, Lady Risha. I’ll use more scented oil during your baths.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need it!”</p>
<p>Risha, who had been defiant, couldn’t understand why things suddenly went awry and felt irritated.</p>
<p>What was wrong with asking about her family’s recent affairs? It seemed like his personality had only gotten nastier.</p>
