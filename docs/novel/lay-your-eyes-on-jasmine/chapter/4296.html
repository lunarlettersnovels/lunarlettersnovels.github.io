            <p><strong>Chapter 32.1</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine was embarrassed and held her cheek. Her ears were already red.</p>
<p>“What if someone sees us?” she grumbled.</p>
<p>“Let them look.”</p>
<p><em>And there’s no problem with that?</em> Jasmine raised her eyebrows and responded with a calm look, but her mouth trembled as if she wanted to say something.</p>
<p>His current attitude was something like it didn’t matter to him whether a scandal broke out or whether the previous conversations about marriage sparked a fire.</p>
<p>Where did this person’s lack of etiquette come from? From his power? Because there is nothing to regret?  Or because he thought there was nothing to lose when rumors about her spread?</p>
<p>While her mind was agitated, Richard grabbed her chin and lifted it. Their lips clashed. His large hand grasped the small hands holding the reins, prompting the well-trained horses to stop. The forest breeze blew through their hair.</p>
<p>His tongue glided over her lower lip as if caressing it, and as soon as her lips opened slightly, he invaded her mouth like a beast who had been waiting.</p>
<p>Jasmine, who let out a m0an as they skillfully entangled tongues and mixed saliva, grabbed his sinewy arm as if to stop him, but the kiss only deepened.</p>
<p>It was gentle but persistent. It was greedy, as if he would be satisfied if he swallowed her whole, not leaving a trace. It was familiar but a little strange.</p>
<p>She was like a prey bitten by a snake slowly wrapping around her waist. The sound of their kisses could be heard audibly in the silent forest.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s scalp felt like it would turn red from the heat. She instinctively turned her head to avoid him. His grip on her tightened. Her tongue weakly scraped against her teeth.</p>
<p>Amid the friction, their eyes met through a hazy perspective. It felt like they had been watching each other all along. His piercing, intense blue gaze locked onto hers.</p>
<p>She breathed heavily; her quickened breath revealed her excitement. He gently nibbled at her small chin, which was avoiding him. Jasmine softly m0aned in response.</p>
<p>As he tenderly kissed and nibbled her flushed cheek, the man holding her face firm with the back of her neck briefly observed the trembling woman below him with an inscrutable gaze.</p>
<p>A moment of tension turned into a quick, unhesitating nibble on her earlobe, making her shiver.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Today of all days…” His voice, low and moist, lingered in her ear. “You seem lost in thought.”</p>
<p><em>‘What are you thinking? Huh?’</em></p>
<p>It sounded like he was yearning and anxious, akin to a hungry beast.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just her imagination. Whenever Richard spoke, his emotions seemed to amplify, making it difficult to understand him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Richard’s eyes penetrated like a bloodhound sniffing for a scent. His tongue lightly touched his lips, and his lips seemed to beckon her in. His eyes gleamed and captivated her, causing a shiver to run down her spine.</p>
<p>She involuntarily huddled her shoulders and avoided eye contact. However, Richard, with the corners of his mouth raised, embraced her like a caring gentleman.</p>
<p>His long fingers brushed her collarbone, making her hair stand on end.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>He tilted her chin. Jasmine observed his furrowed brows. “Answer me.”</p>
<p>His persistence was oddly encouraging her. Jasmine, still trying to maintain her composure, couldn’t help but look away from him. She finally replied.</p>
<p>“I just have something on my mind.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p><em>‘I have no idea.’</em></p>
<p>Jasmine looked at him, staring at him quietly. He was intently listening to her words.</p>
<p>A normal lover would find it touching and be appreciative of him that he noticed something was bothering her. However, her relationship wasn’t like that with him.</p>
<p>While it was better than him not noticing her feelings at all, his truly bewildered expression as if he was clueless left her feeling a bit…</p>
<p><em>‘That’s right, he hasn’t felt regret. He didn’t know the feeling of wanting more, being anxious, or seeking affection…’ </em>were Jasmine’s critical and crooked thoughts. <em>‘Perhaps it was due to experience.  It would be natural for this person not to know.’</em></p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Jasmine tilted her head in contemplation. Her solemnness made Richard more serious as well.</p>
<p>He looked around, naturally led his and Jasmine’s horse to one place, and then smoothly got off his mount. After that, he extended his arms and gently embraced her. He pulled her small shoulders into his large shadow.</p>
<p>“Why is my lady worried about something?” he asked.</p>
<p>Looking up at his affectionate face, Jasmine replied curtly. “Because of you.”</p>
<p>“Because of me?”</p>
<p>Richard’s eyebrows went up. He seemed utterly taken aback, and Jasmine sighed a little.</p>
<p>“Sir Richard Aion, the truth is, aside from you, there’s not much to worry about in my bright and sunny life. I wish you knew that.”</p>
<p>“That’s a flattering compliment, but I don’t understand… I’m surprised. Did I do something wrong?”</p>
<p>Seeing his baffled and slightly flustered expression, Jasmine couldn’t help but chuckle. She exhaled a short breath. How should she put this into words?</p>
<p>She touched her aching head. Jasmine had no experience resolving conflicts between men and women before.</p>
<p>It slightly differed from her interactions with family and friends, but the basic principles should be the same, right? After all, it was a conversation and a human relationship at that.</p>
<p>“So, we… we slept together.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
