            <h3>Chapter 85.2</h3>
<p>His soothing voice was sweet. Suddenly, she felt like crying.</p>
<p>“It was just me, being overly greedy. It’s not your fault. Don’t apologize.”</p>
<p>His kind words sounded like something Jasmine herself would have said in the past, tired from unrequited love.</p>
<p>No, it was exactly the same. It was so eerily similar that seeing him standing in the same place she once stood felt ironic and sad.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, Jasmine, like a child who had accidentally broken a fishbowl, was wide-eyed and shedding tears. Unable to even frown, she cried like a sudden downpour, and Richard’s expression finally crumpled miserably.</p>
<p>He fumbled, clenching and unclenching his fists, then roughly ran his hand through his hair and cursed. It was probably directed at himself, but Jasmine, who was sobbing, was startled and hiccupped.</p>
<p>“W-what, hic, are you cursing at me?”</p>
<p>“No! No, I’m sorry. Don’t cry.”</p>
<p>Jasmine, I’m the one at fault. Okay? Please don’t cry.</p>
<p>Richard continued to fumble, eventually moving close to her and gently cupping her flushed cheeks, carefully wiping away her tears as if she might break. Yet, the tears kept flowing. He muttered in panic, wondering how such a small body could produce so many tears.</p>
<p>His large, slightly trembling hand rubbed her warm forehead and continuously brushed her wet eyes with his thumb. Jasmine cried sorrowfully, overwhelmed by her emotions.</p>
<p>“Sniff, sob! I’m sorry! I just…”</p>
<p>“No, don’t apologize. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Heuk, huk! Uh-huh!”</p>
<p>“Please, Jasmine…”</p>
<p>You’re crying, and it feels like my heart is being torn apart.</p>
<p>Defeated, Richard scowled and finally embraced her. He held her tightly, pressing his shoulder against her round head, and comforted her, kissing her face, which was drenched in tears. The gentle, scattered kisses soothed the tears.</p>
<p>Startled, Jasmine opened her eyes, and he kissed her there, too. He softly pressed his lips against hers, whispering in a low voice.</p>
<p>“What can I do to make you not cry?”</p>
<p>“Huk!”</p>
<p>“What? Jasmine. What can I do for you? Will I never appear in front of you again?”</p>
<p>“Heuk? Uh-huh!”</p>
<p>Startled by his seemingly kind yet cruel words, Jasmine shook her head vigorously. Sobbing, she grabbed his wrist like a child. Her emotions had overwhelmed her, and she didn’t realize her actions.</p>
<p>Ironically, even that sight was so endearing and amusing that Richard, who had his chin resting on her warm head while holding her tightly, chuckled. The fact that he could feel so sweet and happy while saying he would disappear forever if she wished made him realize he wasn’t entirely sane.</p>
<p>The small woman, hiccupping continuously and shaking, felt like another heartbeat pounding within him. The soft and delicate sensation drove him mad with love.</p>
<p>Richard let out a pained sigh and kissed her hair. Would it be okay to die like this? Is this another crazy thought?</p>
<p>Jasmine’s intuition was indeed correct. The man holding her now was both the same and different from the one she knew before. How could someone who didn’t know such blissful despair be the same as the current him?</p>
<p>Richard whispered in a hoarse voice into Jasmine’s reddened ear.</p>
<p>“What else can I do for you? Right, you told me not to smile. If you don’t want to see it, I won’t smile.”</p>
<p>“Heuk, what nonsense…”</p>
<p>With swollen eyes, Jasmine blinked away her last tears like squeezing out pearls and glared at him resentfully. Her round eyes, red and puffy like a heated fish, made Richard laugh inappropriately.</p>
<p>‘Ah, she’s so cute. Why is everything she does so adorable?’</p>
<p>Unable to hold back his chuckles, he playfully pinched Jasmine’s cheek and kissed her incessantly like a robin pecking at its mate. She had no chance to resist.</p>
<p>“You’re cute.”</p>
<p>Astonished, Jasmine sniffled but couldn’t help looking up and down at him. Has he gone mad?</p>
<p>“Heuk, are, are you crazy? Heuk!”</p>
<p>“Jasmine, maybe you should either curse or cry, not both.”</p>
<p>“You’re the one making me swear!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha!”</p>
<p>As Richard laughed joyfully after putting her in such a difficult position, an irritated Jasmine yelled back. He rubbed his cheek against her cheek, bursting into laughter. When the angry Jasmine tried to wriggle out of his embrace, he quickly caught her and held her tight again.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Don’t be mad.”</p>
<p>“You’re so annoying! You weirdo!”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. I’m a weirdo.”</p>
<p>His casual nodding made Jasmine genuinely horrified and even more annoyed, but her glare lacked intensity, like a chick trying to stare someone down.</p>
<p>Because of that, Richard continued to agree with whatever she said, firmly holding her as she struggled to break free. Exhausted from crying, she didn’t have the energy to shake off his clingy embrace.</p>
<p>In the end, Jasmine muttered with her forehead pressed against his shoulder.</p>
<p>“You’re really weird.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Richard agreed to this as well.</p>
<p>‘You’ve strayed far from normal since I met you, you know. I couldn’t be more furious with you. But now, I can’t even remember why I was angry,’ Jasmine thought as she lay in his arms, her pulse racing.</p>
