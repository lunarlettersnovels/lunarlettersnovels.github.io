            <h3>Chapter 87.2</h3>
<p>No matter how he behaved, Jasmine naturally accepted it. Moreover, knowing him inside and out, she would have appropriately maintained boundaries and adjusted to him in every way.</p>
<p>Richard Aion was like a finely tuned, sensitive instrument, making it extremely difficult for him to feel “comfort” and “stability.”</p>
<p>No one knew how much he calculated and weighed things internally while maintaining a composed exterior. He didn’t even show his personal likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>Even while smiling politely, he would have already cut off anything unsuitable in his mind, maintaining an indifferent stance thereafter. Thus, people, without knowing why, would hover around his boundaries but never get close.</p>
<p>So, it was impossible for someone to blend seamlessly into a relationship with him without any friction from the start. Realizing that there was another reason beyond just compatibility, Richard felt a dizzying sense of realization.</p>
<p>He was truly receiving a great deal of love.</p>
<p>When he remained silent for a while, Jasmine, watching him cautiously, spoke up.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if I’m being presumptuous, I was just wondering if….”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that…”</p>
<p>Richard frowned slightly, as if the sunset tickling his forehead was bothersome.</p>
<p>“It’s not you; it’s me who was being presumptuous.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“Are you okay now?”</p>
<p>“With what?”</p>
<p>Jasmine looked at him curiously as he suddenly changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Being with me.”</p>
<p>He was asking if she felt a bit more comfortable now. Jasmine hesitated for a moment, then, feeling resigned, decided there was no point in lying.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s not so awkward that my hands and feet are all twisted and I don’t know where to look anymore.”</p>
<p>“Was it like that?”</p>
<p>“Well, when you meet someone you fought with, it’s always like that. Why would I be any different?”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>Richard agreed readily. He wondered why, despite it being a natural reaction, he only felt overwhelming joy and relief.</p>
<p>Was it because his longing had grown too intense? Like a hunting dog reunited with its master after being forcibly separated for a long time, he had been endlessly circling around her, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>“Unlike you, I must thic-skinned. I just feel endlessly happy when I see you.”</p>
<p>“…Can you not say things like that?”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Those casual, embarrassing comments.”</p>
<p>Richard looked as if he had been struck. His next words came out trembling with surprise.</p>
<p>“Did I make you uncomfortable?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that. It’s just… a bit embarrassing.”</p>
<p>Seeing him so flustered, Jasmine felt like she had been too harsh and sighed. But she felt it was necessary to speak up this time.</p>
<p>Jasmine thought about the realizations she had while talking with her friends earlier. She had been too focused on her own pain to truly listen to his explanations and pleas. Perhaps her decision back then had been hasty.</p>
<p>Jasmine felt embarrassed by her past immaturity and guilty seeing Richard still entangled in that incident. Moreover, watching Richard cautiously gauge her reactions brought back memories of her past self, complicating her feelings.</p>
<p>But did that mean she should accept him back? The truth was, she hesitated at the thought.</p>
<p>Her old affection had been too long and deep, leaving traces that still affected her current feelings like a lingering afterimage, making her emotions towards Richard murky, like a mixture of colors.</p>
<p>It was more regret and pity than love, and while she felt sorry and worried for him, she couldn’t muster the courage to freely give and accept everything as she might have in the past.</p>
<p>When she had burst out, demanding not to hear it, what surged in her heart was not repulsion or anger, but a vague and profound fear, a true feeling she hadn’t even realized she had.</p>
<p>Realizing this vividly made her even more cautious. What if she accepted him without boundaries, feeling sorry and still lingering, only to fall back into the same sweet swamp, the cozy chaos as before?</p>
<p>Jasmine knew that when it came to Richard Aion, she was incredibly soft-hearted, and one misstep could lead to an irreversible situation.</p>
<p>But she no longer wanted to hurt him. She didn’t want to be a thorn in his side either. Because when he was in pain, she hurt even more.</p>
<p>After all, love is like fire; no matter how long it burns, it eventually goes out. Even Jasmine’s persistent affection had now reached a lull.</p>
<p>So, couldn’t she wait until his fire extinguished?</p>
<p>Time heals all wounds. If luck was on their side, maintaining an appropriate distance might eventually allow them to remain close and respectful acquaintances. In Jasmine’s relatively short romantic history, there were instances where she had dated longer than with Richard but had remained friends afterward.</p>
<p>Even if the chances were slim, Jasmine felt the need to draw a line for both his and her sake.</p>
<p>“I understand that you have feelings for me. But those kinds of words are something you say to a lover.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Richard thought for a moment, then slowly nodded. His heart felt a bit warm, but he brushed it off as nothing significant.</p>
<p>“Understood. It seems I’ve gotten into the habit of being honest with you.”</p>
<p>This time, Jasmine’s fingers twitched slightly. His words made it sound as if she were someone special to him. Noticing her reaction, Richard asked, almost as if he could read her mind.</p>
<p>“Does that make you uncomfortable too?”</p>
<p>“No, not to that extent…”</p>
<p>Jasmine shook her head, but Richard knew she was considering his feelings once again.</p>
<p>“This is difficult. I don’t know much about this.”</p>
<p>I’m sorry. Richard apologized with a sigh. It was the first time he had been so blinded by love, and he had no experience with it.</p>
<p>Being overwhelmed by emotions, his usual calmness and rational judgment were lacking. Thus, he must appear incredibly inexperienced to her. Richard didn’t want Jasmine to feel burdened and avoid him because of it.</p>
