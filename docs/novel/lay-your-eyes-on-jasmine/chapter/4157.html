            <h3>Chapter 102.1</h3>
<p>Wow, this is crazy. Wasn’t I being too thoughtless? At this blooming age, what was I thinking to take on such a burdensome task?</p>
<p>Is being a duchess all that great? In a few years, there will be pressure to have children, and as you can see with Marian, even just having children will mortgage your freedom, leaving no room for leisure.</p>
<p>Of course, there will be a nanny, but Jasmine did not want to be the kind of mother who, like many noblewomen, only gave birth and paid no attention to raising the child. At the very least, she would raise the child herself, and cherish them until they were emotionally fulfilled.</p>
<p>Just like their mother, the Grand Duchess, who raised Jasmine and her siblings. But how easy would that be! Childbirth and childcare would both be a sweet hell!</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>“My head was really in the clouds.”</p>
<p>“Jasmine. What…”</p>
<p>“I guess I really lived like a racehorse, only looking straight ahead.”</p>
<p>‘Like a horse running towards the finish line named Richard Aion. And that was exactly me.’ Jasmine was dumbfounded by her own naive immaturity. Fortunately, she realized it before it was too late, but it was just dizzying and overwhelming.</p>
<p>“Richard, this might not be the right thing to say in this situation.”</p>
<p>“Might not be?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s a good thing that our marriage talks fell through back then.”</p>
<p>For this part, she should thank Richard and the unknown Miss Lily. Richard frowned at Jasmine’s relieved expression.</p>
<p>“Are you rejecting me in a different way now?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that. I was just thinking too lightly about marriage. I was ignorant and, as they say, brave because of it.”</p>
<p>Jasmine waved her hand dismissively and briefly apologized before sharing her thoughts. Richard furrowed his brow and thought for a moment before slowly nodding.</p>
<p>“I understand that childbirth and other factors can make marriage more burdensome for women than for men.”</p>
<p>“Knowing that, you still wanted to settle me down?”</p>
<p>“Well, I didn’t intend to marry immediately. I planned to maintain an engagement for at least a year…”</p>
<p>As he quickly made excuses and glanced at her cautiously, she rested her chin on her hand and gazed at him. He was truly a beautiful man. Attractive and someone she was drawn to. And as she looked at him, she suddenly had this thought.</p>
<p>‘What do I want to do with him? That familiar sense of connection and romance? Then what comes after that? Is it marriage? Why?’</p>
<p>“Is there really a need to get married?”</p>
<p>The words slipped out before she realized it. Richard, who had been so earnest, froze. He stared at her with a subtle expression.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, you know. As the Fuke, you naturally think about marriage, but I don’t. I’m the youngest daughter, our family is powerful, and not only is my future secure, but I also have enough wealth to give my future nieces and nephews some pocket money. Why should I be worrying about marriage at my age? Honestly, I don’t even have to.”</p>
<p>Yes, if it weren’t for him, it wouldn’t even be a matter worth considering. In the Liovanni family, known for their fertility over generations, there was a tradition of not forcing marriage on children other than the heir, as long as they could take care of themselves.</p>
<p>After all, there were many children, and just as many talented descendants. Jasmine’s great-aunt, for example, remained single her entire life, living affluently and is currently traveling around the world. Jasmine began to realize anew how fortunate she was.</p>
<p>Wow. She suddenly remembered the words of a girl whose name she can’t recall, who used to be jealous of her for no reason and badmouth her, only to be scolded by Marian.</p>
<p>The girl had cried, “You have everything! It’s unfair!” and Jasmine wanted to ask if that was really a reason to slander her and spread strange rumors about her.</p>
<p>Is it someone else’s fault that you have less? It’s one thing to be envious, but to tear others down as if your jealousy is a right—what’s there to brag about?</p>
<p>But right now, she kind of understand it a bit (though even so, belittling others out of jealousy is despicable and wrong).</p>
<p>Jasmine was definitely born with a lot. It’s something to be grateful for.</p>
<p>Thinking this, she looked at Richard, who appeared calm on the outside. He tapped his knee with his index finger and spoke gently.</p>
<p>“Is that what you were thinking?”</p>
<p>“It’s a bit out of the blue, but yes. Seeing Marian made me realize that. I feel like I’ve been living thoughtlessly.”</p>
<p>Jasmine said brightly. Richard let out a dry laugh and sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s driving me crazy. Jasmine, do you know what I’m thinking?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea.”</p>
<p>As she tilted her head in curiosity, Richard looked at her with a face full of unspoken words. The more he got to know her, the more she unintentionally had a knack for touching something deep inside him.</p>
<p>Her strangely defenseless nature, her surprising honesty with her emotions, her popularity that drew men to her, and how she would immediately shift her attention elsewhere if she got distracted or distanced, as if she had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>It was as if she had no regrets, and the maddening part was that she was right. Jasmine had nothing to regret, just as she had said.</p>
<p>She was unaware of this fact about herself, but now she was beginning to realize it. D@mn it, half a year was too long.</p>
