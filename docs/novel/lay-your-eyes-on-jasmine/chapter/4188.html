            <h3>Chapter 86.1</h3>
<p>Richard’s large hand gently patted her back. The warm touch felt comforting and pleasant. She was utterly exhausted from crying so much. Her dazed violet eyes gazed over his shoulder at the slowly setting sun, painting the sky in shades of blue and orange, and the beautiful riverside.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because her mind was numb. Despite being a familiar sight, the capital bathed in a rosy glow looked serene and romantic. She sneezed briefly and shivered. The riverside was chilly as the autumn sun set.</p>
<p>Richard immediately opened his coat and pulled her small body into its warmth. It felt as cozy as entering a warm house, as if she were submerged in hot water.</p>
<p>When was the last time she felt such peace, this intensely gentle sensation?</p>
<p>She couldn’t remember.</p>
<p>But she was certain that even then, this annoying man who always provoked and angered her was by her side.</p>
<p>A sense of defeat rose within her. Jasmine chose to ignore it.</p>
<p>“Are you cold?”</p>
<p>Richard, mistaking her slight shiver from emotional turmoil for coldness, pulled back slightly to check her expression and asked. Jasmine didn’t answer. Instead, she buried her face back into his chest.</p>
<p>Haah. The emptiness from the brief separation was quickly filled. Too exhausted to think about anything else, she ignored his startled and tense reaction to the small contact. She closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Ah. I’m so tired.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jasmine found it hard to believe herself, but she must have dozed off for a moment, just a very brief moment. His excessively warm body heat was like a cozy fireplace filled with several logs. Strong, broad, and warm.</p>
<p>With her emotions and physical strength completely drained, Jasmine couldn’t help but relax in his warm embrace.</p>
<p>…That’s the excuse she wanted to make.</p>
<p>Jasmine vaguely realized that her body was swaying gently, as if cradled in a comfortable rhythm. Additionally, she noticed she was being carried on a broad back. And that the owner of that back was Richard.</p>
<p>This alone was surprising enough, but Jasmine couldn’t bring herself to say she was awake. She was in a half-dream state, hearing his low humming.</p>
<p>The moment she recognized it, she became fully alert. Naturally, the idea that the iron-blooded Duke Richard Aion was singing—excluding military and national anthems—was an extremely rare and unusual sight.</p>
<p>And surprisingly, it sounded pleasant.</p>
<p>Was it because his voice was inherently good? Jasmine slowly blinked her eyelids. Whether it was a lullaby or a love song, the melody was beautiful. It was a song she had never heard before.</p>
<p>Despite mastering various cultural refinements, including music, Jasmine couldn’t identify it. Was it a classical nursery rhyme? Or perhaps a regional folk song?</p>
<p>“Did you have a good dream?”</p>
<p>Startled by the words directed at her, Jasmine pretended to remain asleep, staring at the back of Richard’s head.</p>
<p>She felt a sense of déjà vu. But she couldn’t tell if it was because of the current situation of being carried on his back, or if it was the memories of him gently asking her every morning if she had a good dream while kissing her forehead.</p>
<p>Jasmine bit her lip slightly, then moistened it with her tongue and murmured.</p>
<p>“I’m still asleep.”</p>
<p>A low chuckle resonated through his back. Even after speaking, Jasmine’s ears turned red.</p>
<p>“Is that so? I must have been talking to myself then.”</p>
<p>“How did you know I was awake?”</p>
<p>“Your breathing is different.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Indeed, his senses were so sharp that it was almost supernatural. She remembered trying to fake sleep to get some rest from his constant advances, but he always noticed and teased her instead. The memory made her scratch her cheek in slight embarrassment.</p>
<p>“You seem to have been doing well.”</p>
<p>What is he talking about all of a sudden? Jasmine blinked in confusion at Richard’s abrupt statement. He adjusted his hold on her and tilted his head.</p>
<p>“It feels like you’ve gained weight. More than last time…”</p>
<p>What? Jasmine, who was momentarily stunned, shouted back.</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t! I didn’t gain any weight!”</p>
<p>Touching on the most sensitive issue for a lady! He’s crossed the line! Despite Jasmine’s huffing and puffing like a wildcat, Richard calmly continued.</p>
<p>“While someone was in agony, longing, and staying faithful, eagerly awaiting the day we’d meet again, it seems you were doing well. That’s good. At least one of us was happy.”</p>
<p>“Who said I was doing well…”</p>
<p>I did manage well, didn’t I? Jasmine thought to herself, suddenly at a loss for words. Although her heart wasn’t always at ease, she had actively and bravely overcome the pain of heartbreak quite well.</p>
