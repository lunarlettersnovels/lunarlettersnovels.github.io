            <h3>Chapter 75.2</h3>
<p>Jasmine watched him leave with disbelief. He wasn’t wrong, but his attitude was incredibly rude. What did Marian see in this man? His face was good enough, but he was too refined, too rough, and his speech especially irritated her.</p>
<p>Though she knew this was a vast improvement… the incident where young knight Soyer swore at his superior and got disciplined was still well-known.</p>
<p>“Old habits die hard, indeed….”</p>
<p>Jasmine clicked her tongue and shook her head.</p>
<p>A man should speak elegantly and kindly. It would be even better if he were gentle and caring, with a quiet, deep voice. A proper gentleman doesn’t raise his voice unnecessarily and maintains calmness.</p>
<p>And where are his manners? Didn’t he learn any etiquette as a noble? He’s more of a pompous brat.</p>
<p>Jasmine pursed her lips in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>“And above all, he’s younger. That brat.”</p>
<p>Yes, Marian and her husband were a couple with an age difference. He speaks so rudely to his wife and even to me, his elder. The empire’s respect for seniors is going down the drain (Jasmine conveniently forgot the times she pulled out her brothers hair).</p>
<p>Recalling the unpleasant encounter from yesterday, Jasmine shook her head, reaffirming that she couldn’t get along with younger men. She decided to bring up Marian’s situation.</p>
<p>After all, he was desperate enough to visit the duke’s house—so he shouldn’t refuse her visit.</p>
<p>She could also gather some information about his colleagues. Who knows? His affair partner might be a coworker. Female knights like Julia were known for their healthy and sexy appearances.</p>
<p>With their toned, tanned bodies, spending most of the day together at work, and having common interests, they were very risky. Richard had mentioned it, too. Most men have affairs with coworkers.</p>
<p>“If it’s true….”</p>
<p>She would pluck every single one of his perfect white hairs and make a cat’s cradle out of them. A fierce flame burned in Jasmine’s violet eyes.</p>
<p>As her slender fingers curled like spider legs, the men in front of her felt an inexplicable chill. Why did their hair follicles feel cold, especially on their scalps?</p>
<p>“Then we will escort you to the Order of the White Knights.”</p>
<p>“No need. I know the way.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, no, it’s quite complicated for an outsider….”</p>
<p>Jasmine smiled brightly but then tilted her head when she saw the expressions on the knights’ faces. Why did they suddenly look as if they’d seen the reaper?</p>
<p>Their gazes were fixed over her shoulder. Just as she was about to turn her head, a voice interrupted.</p>
<p>“Are you saying you’ll guide an outsider with no special position without prior notice into the Order?”</p>
<p>The voice was calm but carried a clear rebuke.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s heart pounded, and her eyes widened.</p>
<p>He stood behind her.</p>
<p>A long shadow covered her, his scent cool like a winter forest after rain, and his low, soft voice echoed nearby. The hair on her ears stood up as if she were facing a captivating predator. Her palms tingled.</p>
<p>She resisted the urge to turn around, biting her lip. Fortunately, he walked forward before she did. As he passed her, he stopped, and she couldn’t help but meet his gaze.</p>
<p>As their eyes locked, Richard hungrily took in her violet gaze.</p>
<p>He then spoke politely.</p>
<p>“Lady Jasmine Liovanni.”</p>
<p>“Duke Aion.”</p>
<p>Their exchange was so formal and courteous that it seemed out of a fairy tale. Richard’s eyes lingered on the hem of her skirt, the lace petticoat, and the tip of her red shoe peeking out as she curtsied. He smiled slightly and asked,</p>
<p>“What brings you here?”</p>
<p>“I was passing by and thought to visit my brother.”</p>
<p>“I heard this wasn’t your destination.”</p>
<p>Jasmine fidgeted with her fingers and glanced at the two knights, who looked pale and scared of the duke, the Minister of Defence and Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<p>Indeed, even though she was the daughter of a duke and the sister of the Commander of the Azure Knights, she was still technically an outsider to the military. The knights could be dismissed for such a mistake.</p>
<p>And the man before her was known for his strict adherence to military law. She sighed and adjusted her hair.</p>
<p>“Um, I’m sorry. I didn’t think it through.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. You haven’t broken any rules yet.”</p>
