            <h3>Chapter 68.1</h3>
<p>“What if he really is having an affair? What will I do? Meeting him was the happiest moment of my life.”</p>
<p>“Marianne….”</p>
<p>Jasmine, feeling her friend’s pain, tried to comfort her. She somehow understood what Marianne was going through, especially after meeting Richard today. Suddenly, Marianne, who had been bowing her head, jumped up and screamed.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of living like this? I’m going to die. I want to die!”</p>
<p>“Hey, calm down! Calm down!”</p>
<p>“Catch her!”</p>
<p>As Marianne frantically ran towards the window, everyone jumped up in alarm to grab her. Marianne, who was surprisingly strong despite her delicate appearance, shook off Nikki and Aisha, who were holding her arms, and Jasmine, who was grabbing her waist, was dragged along due to her lack of strength.</p>
<p>How is this girl so strong? Did she eat a whole ox or something? In the chaos, Julia detached Jasmine’s hand from Marianne’s, lifted Marianne up like a doll, and moved her away from the window.</p>
<p>“Let go! Let go of me!” she screamed, struggling. Julia firmly held her and motioned with her chin for someone to close the window. Indeed, the border guard of the Empire; protecting the frontier was not for just anyone.</p>
<p>While Jasmine, Nikki, and Aisha watched Julia with admiration, Lichang, who had been observing the chaos while smoking a cigarette, elegantly closed the window, ending the suicide attempt.</p>
<p>That night, Marianne cried and wailed, refusing to go home, saying she couldn’t stand to see her husband’s face.</p>
<p>So, it was decided that she would stay at Jasmine’s house for a few days. Jasmine didn’t want to send her friend back to a husband who made her suffer, so she gladly offered her the guest house.</p>
<p>And naturally, in all that commotion, Jasmine completely forgot about Richard.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Am I going crazy?</p>
<p>Richard pondered seriously.</p>
<p>How could it be normal to think about one person non-stop all day? He knew he had a tendency to obsess over one thing when it came to work or war, but this was extreme.</p>
<p>Thank goodness he had taken a leave of absence. Otherwise, Richard would have been unable to function, practically a lunatic. He was relieved to avoid such incompetence.</p>
<p>He kept thinking about Jasmine, over and over again. It was as if she lived at the center of his thoughts.</p>
<p>The Jasmine he endlessly reminisced about was the one from six months ago, the one preserved in the brilliant week they spent together in the garden.</p>
<p>But meeting the real, breathing Jasmine made his blood race through his veins. The present Jasmine far surpassed the one from his memories.</p>
<p>Even though she was colder and more distant than before, even showing signs of dislike, he still found her lovely and beautiful just by hearing her speak, seeing her expressions, and touching her.</p>
<p>How could preserved memories ever compare to the real sensation of her presence? The difference was as stark as waves compared to sleet.</p>
<p>The thirst inside him, once mildly quenched, only grew stronger.</p>
<p>If Richard’s self-control had been even slightly less, Jasmine would have faced a ruthless beast.</p>
<p>He could barely remember the events in the carriage earlier.</p>
<p>He felt intensely how, when overly immersed, only the crucial parts of his senses remained while the rest faded. It was inevitable. After being apart for six months, just being together in a confined space was enough to exhilarate him.</p>
<p>Moreover, the habits ingrained in his body and brain couldn’t be ignored. During that passionate period, they couldn’t keep their hands off each other, sneaking around to be together. Alone in a private space, words were unnecessary.</p>
<p>Once Richard started touching her, his hands moved without hesitation, out of habit. Remembering the sensation, Richard felt dizzy, clutching his forehead and closing his eyes tightly.</p>
<p>‘Really, she didn’t miss me?’</p>
<p>But when he held her, it felt like she was also waiting for his touch. Was it just his imagination?</p>
<p>Richard was determined to ask her directly because he couldn’t understand Jasmine. But even face-to-face, nothing changed. Unlike her past self, the current Jasmine wasn’t entirely honest.</p>
<p>If her past self was an open door, now she was firmly shut, surrounded by an icy wall. It seemed she had no intention of opening up.</p>
<p>Feeling that difference, the sense of loss was overwhelming.</p>
<p>What had he lost?</p>
<p>What should he do? Jilian said to give it time, but even after enough time had passed, Jasmine remained the same. If anything, she had grown more distant.</p>
<p>Richard was frustrated and angry at how nothing was going his way. Over time, he had become somewhat desensitized and more patient with such situations, but his dislike for them hadn’t changed.</p>
<p>It felt like he was trapped in a maze. There was no way out. For him, just not going to her, begging pathetically, or kissing her like a wild animal was a feat.</p>
<p>“Whoa, you scared me! What are you doing here, brooding?”</p>
