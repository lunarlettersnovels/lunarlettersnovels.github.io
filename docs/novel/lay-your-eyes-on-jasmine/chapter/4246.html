            <p><strong>Chapter 57.1</strong></p>
<p>Many men clung to her desperately only to be coldly brushed off and left crying, men who fought each other out of passion, such as an ex and the current guy Jasmine was dating.</p>
<p>And Jasmine, who used to have no interest in such incidents, cut them off without batting an eye.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but I don’t know what else to do for you. We weren’t that serious to begin with, were we?”</p>
<p>“Were we really that serious to begin with? I told you beforehand. I didn’t want anything deep.”</p>
<p>Nikki looked at Jasmine strangely as she repeated the words she had said in front of her ex-boyfriend before.</p>
<p>“You sound like a really bad girl.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Jasmine pondered for a moment. Even her open-minded friends seemed worried about her situation, and she wondered if her behavior was still appropriate. After all, she had met other people non-stop lately.</p>
<p>But Jasmine also felt unjustified. She hadn’t made any advances or approached anyone first. She simply met them as they came, without preemptive rejection like before.</p>
<p>She didn’t particularly want to think deeply or get serious. Everyone else was doing it. Why couldn’t she?</p>
<p>Continuing like this one or two times made it easier to adopt such an attitude. It was a change she couldn’t have imagined just a year ago.</p>
<p>She had never thought that such sporadic dating was productive.</p>
<p>But despite always having loving family and friends, something felt empty and dull. A subtle but definite hunger that persisted even after exercising, learning something new, laughing, and chatting all day long.</p>
<p>So she started dating.</p>
<p>If she focused on her new relationship, she wouldn’t feel bored, but the excitement was too short-lived. It used to last at least a month before, but it gradually shortened to two weeks, then ten days, and now a week was the limit.</p>
<p>Anything longer felt like a waste of time, and the other person’s unspoken expectations became tiresome and annoying, whether it was for her affection, time, looks, or pleasure.</p>
<p>Of course, ordinary men couldn’t openly demand such things from Lady Jasmine Liovanni, but there was an implicit expectation of physical intimacy.</p>
<p>The moment Jasmine sensed those subconscious desires or expectations, her heart cooled instantly. She also found it strange.</p>
<p>But what could she do about the discomfort?</p>
<p>She was as repelled and disgusted by them as if they were mosquitoes or cockroaches.</p>
<p>‘I’m okay with kissing, though.’</p>
<p>A very small minority made it to kissing. But as soon as physical intimacy went beyond that, she rejected them immediately.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why men were so obsessed with that, but Jasmine had plenty of unassertive exes who couldn’t touch her and make her tremble.</p>
<p>Their tastes didn’t match, they couldn’t communicate, and their personalities clashed.</p>
<p>Lichang, who chose men to date, teased Jasmine for being like that. She said Jasmine was only talking about dating and was only after the temporary high.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s true. Jasmine didn’t even know herself.</p>
<p>She accepted confessions simply because she needed someone to alleviate her boredom. But she never had any liking or expectations towards the other person.</p>
<p>As usual, Lichang kept a level head. Jasmine pouted her lips, and Lichang smiled and told her to do whatever she wanted. However, she advised her to do it in moderation.</p>
<p>She then added significantly:</p>
<p>“You know, Jasmine, men’s jealousy is often scarier than women’s.”</p>
<p>As her friends feared, most of her former lovers, even if they were hurt or perhaps uncomfortable or regretful, withdrew gracefully like nobles, but occasionally, some were excessively disappointed by the breakup and caused a disturbance or behaved rudely.</p>
<p>As the number of failed relationships accumulated, these tired individuals also increased. To Jasmine’s surprise, she had become too popular.</p>
<p>Somehow, even though she was no longer as obsessed with her reputation as she used to be and had long since neglected her beauty and grace as a lady, the more she went out, the more people took notice of her.</p>
<p>It was ridiculous. Jasmine suddenly felt tired of all these things.</p>
<p>“It feels like I’ve met too senselessly. I won’t meet anyone for a while.”</p>
<p>“What about that young lord?”</p>
<p>“I’ll sort that one out properly.”</p>
<p>“Ah, pitiful Lord Peterson.”</p>
<p>Nicky shook her head with pity. But that was it. They immediately diverted their attention to another topic.</p>
<p>“By the way, Marian sent a letter…”</p>
<p>“Oh! It’s been a while since I’ve seen Marian. I miss her.”</p>
<p>“Is she still stirring up trouble and then making up?”</p>
<p>“Well, what else could it be? Fight, make up, and then love each other again…”</p>
<p>“Hahaha.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The victor’s flag fluttered vigorously under the blue sky. Crown Prince Jilian, holding the reins, sat atop his horse at the forefront of the expeditionary force.</p>
<p>The corners of his mouth raised as he looked at the approaching outline of the white castle—the heart of the majestic and beautiful empire containing centuries of history.</p>
<p>It had been nearly six months since their departure.</p>
