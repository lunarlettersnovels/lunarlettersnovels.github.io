<p><strong>Chapter 31.1</strong></p>
<p>At that time, Jasmine didn’t know anything, and she wondered how she could be acting like this. But after trying it once, she understood. That’s how powerful s3x is.</p>
<p>When your brain is paralyzed by the intense, primal attraction between a man and a woman, and your heart beats like a wild beast in mating season, it’s easy to mistake it for love. Jasmine, too, felt that her emotions had deepened after she intimately got involved with Richard.</p>
<p>So, thinking rationally, Jasmine understood why Richard was acting this way. She’d heard that the body sometimes temporarily loses control when the body’s desires are fulfilled.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it was impossible to explain why he was so composed before sleep but had such a drastic change in attitude after waking up.</p>
<p>After contemplating all this, she felt down but found it wasn’t surprising. Now that she was serious, she had no choice but to be more cautious of her mental and physical safety. The body and the mind sometimes didn’t work separately for people like Jasmine.</p>
<p>So, let’s say that Richard had fallen deeply for her physically. Was that a good thing for her?</p>
<p>It was better than him hating it, honestly. It was nice and made her happy. However, Jasmine’s greed had become a problem.</p>
<p>She didn’t just want him physically but also desired his heart and soul.</p>
<p>She wanted Richard to be truly in love with her, to initiate their relationship, to treat her well, to be caring, and to share kisses just as she did.</p>
<p>What would it look like for Richard to be genuinely in love? Based on what she’d seen so far, he would treat her well. There were signs already.</p>
<p>His heartbroken expression when he said he liked Lily was painful.</p>
<p>Jasmine suddenly felt her heart burning. She frowned. It was a real issue. She’d dealt with unrequited love without feeling too down during her long period of one-sided love. But at this moment, Jasmine was acutely aware of a tremendous crisis.</p>
<p>An unrequited love was a different realm. Mixing bodies and deepening the relationship made it not just a matter of self-reflection; it was a blow beyond that. Moreover, this time, it was mutual. Richard also had responsibilities in this relationship.</p>
<p>Jasmine finally regained her composure.</p>
<p>She felt a stronger obligation to actively protect her mental state. Regardless of what happened, Jasmine trembled with fear because she was her most precious asset.</p>
<p>As always.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A gunshot ripped through the long, sunny summer sky. Everyone marveled as a beautiful horned stag fell as if in slow motion. Applause and cheers erupted.</p>
<p>“It seems the Duke is in good condition today.”</p>
<p>“That stag will go to the Crown Prince, right?”</p>
<p>“Well, of course. He’s always been like that.”</p>
<p>Despite not having a formal relationship or any promises for the future, people whispered, enjoying their fans and wine. They became quiet momentarily and exchanged glances as they watched Lady Liovanni drive her white horse into the forest.</p>
<p>“Seeing the two had secret meetings together for several days, it’s quite amusing.”</p>
<p>“Well, considering what happened before, their relationship isn’t bad.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they’ve been secretly spending a lot of time together.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, you didn’t notice?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>The noble lady whispered, with a meaningful smile on her face. “It’s obvious that they both have fire in their eyes. There must be something between them.”</p>
<p>“No way. Not too long ago, there were rumors that they fought a party. It’s said they’re not on good terms.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Lady Jasmine, who was so single-minded, started seeing someone else. Who was it again? It was Charles, that son of a marquis.</p>
<p>“I heard they broke up.”</p>
<p>“Hoho, in matters of love, only <em>they</em> know the truth, isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>“No, madam Eagle-eye. Do you know anything?”</p>
<p>When someone driven by curiosity asked, the woman, who was skilled at reading between the lines in love affairs, folded her fan with a mischievous laugh.</p>
<p>“Well, you can’t hide it, can you?”</p>
<p>What? When everyone turned their heads to her, she smiled.</p>
<p>“When you fall in love, it’s hard to hide. Even if you try to keep it a secret, no matter how cold-blooded you are, the fever of love makes your heart bloom.”</p>
<p>“Miss Jasmine has been like this for years, so her feelings can’t be easily hidden.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Rather than Lady Jasmine… she thought about the dashing Duke, who had been fixated on a single person throughout the tea party, luncheon, and the hunt, revealing no interest elsewhere, and chuckled.</p>
<p>“Someone who hasn’t experienced it can be even more frightening when they catch up.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jasmine trotted along the forest path, her high ponytail bouncing cheerfully. It had been a while since she had gone riding, and it felt good.</p>
<p>Exercise and walks were the best ways to clear her head when she had many things on her mind. The complicated thoughts washed away quickly, like a thorough shower after a tiring day.</p>
<p>She hummed a little tune while holding the reins, glancing in the direction where the applause and cheers erupted.</p>
<p><em>‘Richard must have caught another stag again.’</em></p>
<p>She mumbled, gazing at the forest head with a disgruntled expression. What on earth could that man not do?</p>
<p>Not only was he skilled in his duties, but he was also the Empire’s best knight. He excelled in hunting, was terrific in bed, and they even said he could cook well.</p>
