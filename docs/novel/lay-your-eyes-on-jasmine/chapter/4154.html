            <h3>Chapter 103.2</h3>
<p>James, with eyes full of things to say, looked at the Duke, who was now quietly bowing his head, and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Duke Aion, it seems today is not the day. Please return to your residence.”</p>
<p>“I apologize for causing a disturbance.”</p>
<p>Richard also bowed his head again, seemingly agreeing that today was not the day. Originally, he rarely bowed his head even to the Emperor, but he was fundamentally humble despite his sharp retorts.</p>
<p>James’s expression became peculiar as he sensed the change in Richard’s attitude. However, it seemed to irritate the Grand Duke even more.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand what nerve you have to hover around my daughter. What, did His Majesty suggest you take over the military and now wants you to get married too?”</p>
<p>“Father, please…”</p>
<p>James sighed and tried to intervene in response to the spiteful remark. He understood, but the opponent was too influential, and behind Duke Aion stood the Emperor, the supreme ruler of the empire. There wasn’t a noble unaware of how much the Emperor cherished his nephew, Richard.</p>
<p>“It’s a misunderstanding, Grand Duke. My marriage is entirely up to my own will. I have never thought of Lady Jasmine lightly. Not once in history.”</p>
<p>“Huh, so rejecting the previous proposal wasn’t done lightly either?”</p>
<p>“At that time, I wasn’t in a position to be faithful to a betrothed, and she is not a woman whom an unprepared person can take responsibility for lightly. Even so, if you rebuke my rashness, I will accept it willingly.”</p>
<p>“Then what about now? What has changed your attitude in just half a year?”</p>
<p>“I hold her in my heart enough to dare speak of responsibility. This too is my audacity.”</p>
<p>Richard responded calmly and sincerely to the Grand Duke’s growling, without blinking an eye, looking straight into the eyes of the fierce noble.</p>
<p>As their argument continued, the atmosphere grew peculiar. It was like a scene from a tale of a wandering knight seeking permission to marry his beloved despite family opposition.</p>
<p>Caras, unusually perceptive of the situation, was trembling with a tic under his eye, while James stood with his arms crossed, his expression unreadable. Jasmine, overwhelmed by the unexpectedly escalating situation, alternated her gaze between her father and Richard, clutching her head.</p>
<p>How did it come to this! She never imagined that this cautiously opened relationship would escalate so dramatically from the start.</p>
<p>“Um, well… both of you, please calm down…”</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying you love our Jasmine? Is that what you’re saying?”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s lips froze as she tried to intervene. The topic she had been avoiding since their reunion suddenly surfaced.</p>
<p>She desperately wanted to either run away or clamp her hand over Richard’s mouth, which was eerily quiet. His eyes briefly turned to her, and Jasmine quickly shook her head. Don’t say it, don’t say it!</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Aaaah!</p>
<p>“I love her.”</p>
<p>Jasmine, screaming internally, looked at each of the shocked members of the Liovanni family, and finally froze when her eyes met Richard’s, who was looking directly at her. His intensely blue eyes, heated like shards of hot glass, were piercingly focused on her.</p>
<p>He was silently saying it again.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>So much that it drives me crazy, as if my heart would burst. As if I can’t live without you.</p>
<p>It felt like an arrow had pierced her chest without a sound. Jasmine took a shaky breath and looked away from his gaze. Her whole body tingled, leaving her disoriented.</p>
<p>She never expected to hear such a confession, such words, at this moment. She had somewhat prepared herself, but now that it was happening, she didn’t know what to do. Everything was too sudden and overwhelming.</p>
<p>She felt so confused that she just wanted to escape somewhere.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, what do you think?”</p>
<p>The Grand Duke, squinting his eyes, glared at the Duke, who was openly showing how much he adored his daughter, then looked at the stunned Jasmine. He let out a long sigh. His face seemed to have aged several years in a short time.</p>
<p>“I… ”</p>
<p>With four men staring intently at her, Jasmine felt as if her face might develop holes. Just as she was about to swallow nervously, a soft yet firm voice interrupted.</p>
<p>“What is everyone doing right now?”</p>
<p>As the gentle voice of a beautiful lady with wavy auburn hair styled up entered with the servants, Jasmine brightened up and shouted.</p>
<p>“Mother!”</p>
<p>“Dear! Well, it’s just that…”</p>
<p>“Oh my, isn’t it Duke Aion?”</p>
<p>The Grand Duchess Eliza, who stopped her husband from explaining by holding his hand, smiled warmly and looked down at Richard.</p>
<p>She looked at him with the gentle and elegant demeanor of a lady, unlike her husband who was angry or her sons who felt offended. It was a smile that seemed kind and friendly, as if they had met at a social event.</p>
<p>“Our Jasmine has brought a friend. It’s no use leaving a guest standing outside. I would like to offer some delicious tea as a token of thanks for safely escorting my daughter. Would you have time?”</p>
<p>Richard quietly faced the Grand Duchess, who had a smile resembling Jasmine’s, and nodded.</p>
<p>“It would be an honor.”</p>
<p>“Then please come in. We’ve just received some fine tea.”</p>
<p>As she turned around lightly with her shawl and gestured with her eyes, the atmospher quickly lightened.</p>
