            <h3>Chapter 98.2</h3>
<p>“Oh my. And your uncle…”</p>
<p>“He passed away recently due to a stress-induced illness.”</p>
<p>It was a serious matter. Jasmine’s face hardened as she expressed her condolences for the deceased. Charles gave a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“So, what are you planning to do?</p>
<p>“My cousin is still there. She’s a kind and delicate girl, and she just became an adult. According to the laws of that country, a woman without a husband cannot inherit property. It’s an absurd law.”</p>
<p>Charles nodded in agreement with Jasmine’s furrowed brow. She began to understand what decision he had made and looked at him with concern.</p>
<p>“Are you sure about this? It’s your life at stake.”</p>
<p>“I’ve lived without any particular desires or dreams so far. I’ve been fortunate to grow up comfortably without much worry. Now it’s time to repay that fortune. Honestly, I was very happy when I received a letter from her saying she needed me.”</p>
<p>Despite Jasmine’s concerned gaze, Charles grinned. It was a bright, confident smile, revealing his white teeth, a look she had never seen on him before.</p>
<p>“I want to be of help to someone who wants and needs me. It may not be love yet, but I want us to cherish and support each other. I want to find the value in my life. Seeing that young, small girl endure trials that even adults struggle with, I realized I want to do everything I can to help her. I want to protect her, even if I’m not much.”</p>
<p>At this point, I think I’m worth something too.</p>
<p>Jasmine looked into his resolute eyes and slowly nodded. A relieved and happy smile appeared on her face.</p>
<p>“Of course. Charles, you’re already wonderful. Go and protect her.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. The more I talk with you, the more confident I am that I’ve made the right decision.”</p>
<p>“I’m starting to feel a bit sad. I think I’ll miss you.”</p>
<p>Jasmine made a light-hearted joke, and Charles laughed pleasantly. A warm atmosphere surrounded them as they smiled at each other. After a moment of hesitation, Charles looked up at Jasmine and asked,</p>
<p>“Jasmine, do you still have feelings for him?”</p>
<p>Jasmine paused. Then she looked into his calm eyes.</p>
<p>“Does it seem that way?”</p>
<p>“When we parted, it seemed like you still had him in your heart.”</p>
<p>Her heart sank. So, he knew too. After all, how could someone not know where the heart of the person they care about is directed? If they were truly paying attention, that is. She felt a pang of bitterness and sighed softly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I really am terrible, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s just that it seemed like there was a shadow on your face, and I was worried.”</p>
<p>He touched his cheek awkwardly. Do I really look that bad? Jasmine laughed softly and squinted her eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, honestly. I don’t know what my heart wants.”</p>
<p>“Whatever it is, I just hope you’re happy.”</p>
<p>I mean it. She looked at Charles quietly as he murmured.</p>
<p>A simple, kind person who adapts well to others without great ambition or greed. Such a person would be quite suitable for marriage and building love. Someone ideal for nurturing love in a calm and peaceful manner.</p>
<p>‘If only I had loved you, maybe I would have found peace too.’</p>
<p>‘Thinking such thoughts made me feel weak. Or perhaps, I have become weak. ‘ Jasmine clicked her tongue.</p>
<p>“Indeed. I don’t know how things ended up this way.”</p>
<p>“People’s hearts don’t always follow their will.”</p>
<p>Mine didn’t either. Charles scratched his head as he spoke. After a brief pause, he continued.</p>
<p>“No man in the world could help but like you, Jasmine. I guarantee it.”</p>
<p>“You’re very confident. Surely, there must be someone who doesn’t find me to their taste.”</p>
<p>Jasmine chuckled, making a light-hearted joke. Charles, who was about to respond, suddenly paused.</p>
<p>The sound of a carriage door slamming shut, followed by hurried footsteps approaching, caught their attention. Charles turned to look at Jasmine, who was curious about the noise, and smiles bitterly. It was a smile filled with mixed thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>“Trust me, I know what I’m talking about. I’m a man too.”</p>
<p>It was a meaningful statement. Jasmine, sensing something unusual, tilted her head in curiosity.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Her shoulders tensed involuntarily. It felt like ages since she had heard that voice. Before she could fully lift her head, a tall figure stood close to their table. The person wore a light blue-tinged gray frock coat, and his gloved hand was clenched into a tight fist.</p>
<p>She remembered how the veins on the back of his hand would stand out when he was like this. Her eyes traveled up his sleek, panther-like torso, past the coat collar, to the pulsating throat and tense jaw, and finally to the thin, displeased lips.</p>
<p>His deeply set, fierce blue eyes were not looking at her. Instead, they were fixed on Charles, who was sitting across from her, with a gaze so cold it seemed to almost kill.</p>
<p>“Lord Alexander.”</p>
<p>As his ominous voice filled the air, it felt as though the atmosphere around them changed completely.</p>
<p>“I heard you have a fiancée.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, that’s correct.”</p>
<p>“Then what are you doing here?</p>
