            <h3>Chapter 62.2</h3>
<p>“Have you forgotten the rank of aristocrats, Peterson, even though you are just a footman without any title?”</p>
<p>Richard’s low voice, digging into her ears after six months, was rough and imposing, like a growling wolf. Even though it wasn’t a threat directed at her, Jasmine couldn’t help but shiver from the anger and murderous intent in it.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of his large hand gripping hers tightly. His huge, hot hands enough to cover her hand up to the fingertips.</p>
<p>She thought she had forgotten everything about him, but his touch was awfully familiar.</p>
<p>Her eyes felt hot. Jasmine hastily tried to pull her hand away, but his firm grip wouldn’t let her go. His large, motionless figure felt like an impenetrable barrier pressing down on her.</p>
<p>Unlike before, instead of discomfort, Jasmine felt burdened. There was a desire to avoid, and confusion made her heart pound erratically.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Richard, who had pounced on the arena, struck fear into Peterson, who had stepped back flustered. Richard’s gaze was authoritarian. When he opened his mouth to speak softly, the air felt chillingly cold.</p>
<p>“I haven’t heard rumors about the Peterson heir being raised as a wastrel.”</p>
<p>“S-sorry…”</p>
<p>“How dare you threaten your superior. And it’s utterly repulsive that you would coerce a lady with strength.”</p>
<p>If this were a battlefield, he would have lost his tongue before he could apologize. Peterson’s face was deathly pale.</p>
<p>Although he received a formal knighthood, he had no experience in actual war, as his father cherished his eldest son. He did not know the true identity of Duke Aion, who was famous for his reputation and even more infamous for his iron sword.</p>
<p>But even without that knowledge, he knew very well that the person’s words before him held immense weight.</p>
<p>Richard felt like pulling out the knife from his waist and cutting the bastard in two right away, but he held back.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since he last met her, half a year in fact, and he felt her trembling warmth in his hands. He didn’t want to startle her even more.</p>
<p>Other little things were meaningless; only the soft little hands and the breath from behind aroused him till he felt dizzy. The urge to quickly turn around and embrace her overlapped with the desire to cut off the hands of the man who dared to touch her.</p>
<p>“Go away.”</p>
<p>If you are seen again, no matter who your father is, know that your head will be blown off. His eyes seemed to say.</p>
<p>Peterson trembled at the contemptuous gesture, then ran away.</p>
<p>Silence fell once again.</p>
<p>As Richard slowly turned around, the light shone on his sharp face, highlighting his well-defined forehead, thick eyebrows, his nose and lips she had once affectionately touched, and his deep blue eyes resembling the winter sea.</p>
<p>And that expression. Ah. Jasmine momentarily closed her eyes, feeling dizzy. She opened them again.</p>
<p>While Jasmine couldn’t shake off her confusion, Richard, almost obsessively, continued to scrutinize her from head to toe.</p>
<p>From her sweet golden locks to her nervously fluttering eyelashes, her amethyst eyes he sorely missed, tempting scarlet lips to even the single freckle on her plump cheek.</p>
<p>Even the breath between her slightly parted lips seemed too precious to waste. It was unbearable. He was going crazy.</p>
<p>When he reached out his hand without realizing it, Jasmine was startled and took a half step back. Moving further away was impossible because of the hand that was holding her. His fingertips, unable to reach through the small gap, hesitantly moved down.</p>
<p>Richard had stopped by the palace this morning to obtain approval for his leave and report about the war. However, he found himself instead detained by various ministers and senior nobles for quite a while.</p>
<p>Feeling like it would never end, he was about to slip away discreetly, but the astute Marquis Atlante, the Minister of Justice, suggested they go to the coffee house where he often frequented to finish the rest of the discussion.</p>
<p>It was hard to refuse, not only because the Marquis was a close confidant of his late father’s but also because he had treated him with great kindness when he had just inherited the title as a young man. They were, and still are, friendly political partners.</p>
<p>He thought it would be better to engage in productive conversations with people rather than spend the whole day thinking about Jasmine.</p>
<p>But he never expected to encounter her here.</p>
<p>She was still as radiant as he remembered her six months ago. He felt a sudden urge to embrace her, to kiss her passionately like a starving dog. But she wasn’t alone.</p>
<p>Richard’s chest swelled as he quickly realized the person sitting in front of her was a man. He was momentarily distracted by meeting Jasmine, but then he remembered the stark details about her personal life from what he’d heard.</p>
<p>As Jasmine turned her gaze away from him towards the man, a wave of dizziness swept over Richard.</p>
<p>Is she pretending not to recognize me? Or is it for real? Is that your new lover? It’s not even the first time, is it?</p>
<p>He had heard the rumors for the past six months, but he couldn’t believe it until he saw it with his own eyes.</p>
