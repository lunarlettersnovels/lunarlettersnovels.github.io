            <p><strong>Chapter 50.2</strong></p>
<p><em>Jasmine, Jasmine, Jasmine!</em></p>
<p>So, she really left. To truly put an end to it.</p>
<p>Is that what it means? Is this the end?</p>
<p>It felt like the tightly controlled threads of reason had suddenly snapped.</p>
<p>Breathing heavily like a mad horse, he arrived at her room, which was eerily empty. No luggage cart, no Jasmine—nothing.</p>
<p>Feeling hollow and disjointed, Richard walked slowly from where he had first met the fresh-faced blonde lady as she stepped out of her carriage. Breathless, he reached the spot. The distinct marks of carriage wheels, freshly imprinted on the road, were unmistakably present.</p>
<p>She had left.</p>
<p>“Jasmine!”</p>
<p>A long-drawn growl erupted from him. His chest swelled dangerously, and his clenched fists trembled with restrained anger.</p>
<p>Jasmine Liovanni. That woman. Jasmine, Jasmine, Jasmine.</p>
<p>You ask me why everything is so easy for me, and I ask you the opposite.</p>
<p>How do you end things so easily?</p>
<p>I can’t imagine. I can’t even fathom it. How?</p>
<p>Do you really think I don’t like you, that I’m just fulfilling a sense of responsibility for you? Is that what you truly believe?</p>
<p>His patience was at an end. He had to go and get her now. The Duke’s eyes flashed like a bird of prey, and he growled, not even looking at the butler who had come running with the news.</p>
<p>“Bring the horses at once.”</p>
<p>To the fastest horse.</p>
<p>Richard’s eyes narrowed as he snatched up the reins of the whinnying steed and expertly mounted it.</p>
<p><em>“I’ll leave.”</em></p>
<p>Jasmine…</p>
<p><em>“You have no self-respect. I’m sick of you.”</em></p>
<p>Pride means nothing to him. Now, he would hug her even if she despised him.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Jasmine, roused by the stableman’s announcement that they had arrived, yawned and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>The Duke’s mansion, situated slightly away from the capital’s outskirts, symbolized the Liovanni family’s political neutrality, maintaining distance from the power, and had stood for generations.</p>
<p>Possessing a small estate-level garden and grounds, the grand mansion exuded an elegant and noble grace. However, to Jasmine, it was simply a comfortable hometown, neither more nor less.</p>
<p>Firstly, having not slept all night, she felt extremely drowsy. With Marie’s support, she let out a yawn. Ugh, tired. She longed for a warm bath and a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p>She stepped into the mansion. In the midst of her drowsiness, she heard a thunderous voice.</p>
<p>“Jasmine!”</p>
<p>“Oh? Nicky?”</p>
<p>Jasmine smiled broadly, happy to hear a voice she hadn’t heard in far too long, and Nicky came running down the stairs, her skirt flapping like a flag, and scooped her up like a flying squirrel.</p>
<p>The little fellow had a spunky, sassy personality, but his short stature made him adorable. Jasmine laughed, thrilled.</p>
<p>“What—why are you in our house?”</p>
<p>“I was here to see Lord Caras! I didn’t expect to see you instead!”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“What’s going on between you and Duke Aion?! What happened? The entire capital is in chaos right now!”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>The news of Richard publicly presenting game to her had spread like wildfire in the social circles. Such gossip spreads quickly, as expected. Jasmine frowned as her excitement subsided.</p>
<p>To have come all the way here to avoid that man, and the first words she hears here are about him. His pervasive influence and their tangled history were exhausting. It might be a gateway she had to pass through inevitably.</p>
<p>Observant friend Nicky, noticing Jasmine’s expression, became wary.</p>
<p>“It seems like it’s not just good news. Did I bring up something unnecessary?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing. It would have reached anyone by now.”</p>
<p>Jasmine stretched Nicky’s worried cheek, smiling wryly.</p>
<p>“Well, good or bad, news about a guy like him is widespread. You know, friend?”</p>
<p>Jasmine burst into laughter at Nicky’s supportive words. Meeting a wholehearted ally who cared more about her feelings than curiosity and speculation made her feel much better. She hadn’t seen her family yet, but the feeling of returning slowly started to set in.</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>It’s still tough, though.</p>
<p>“Jasmine!”</p>
<p>At the sound of approaching footsteps, Jasmine’s eyes widened. As luck would have it, her brother Caras and her parents, the Duke and Duchess, were rushing towards her without regard for their dignity. Momentarily taken aback, she found herself surrounded by her family.</p>
