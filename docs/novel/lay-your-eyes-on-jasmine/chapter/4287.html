        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 36.2</strong></p>
<p>The word sounded gentle and kind, although lying down like a dog was a command. She hesitated but eventually stood on all fours. This position was not new; she refused Richard when he first took her like this.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his face disappeared, and the scene before her returned some sense of rationality. The skies had darkened, and she felt a slight chill from the cold draft. The tension increased as she observed well-trained horses eating and standing still. My God. What are we doing here…</p>
<p>Then, a slap echoed.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“You need to focus.”</p>
<p>His tongue teased over her sensitive cr0tch, making goosebumps erupt on her skin. Elongated fingers swept across the swollen, sensitive flesh. The touch of his elegant hand was vivid, adding to her embarrassment.</p>
<p>Soon, he pressed against the swollen peak, and she almost screamed. The throbbing female organ reacted strongly as he rubbed her wetness along her nub. Her mouth opened unconsciously from the delicious pleasure.</p>
<p>His body was so excited that he unconsciously pulled back his hips and tried to swallow his fingers, but Richard stayed back and watched. Except for the twitching around his eyes, he appeared calm. Only his heavy breathing betrayed his true feelings.</p>
<p>“Richard… Richard…”</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>Immersed in the lust.</p>
<p>When he didn’t resume the act immediately, Jasmine was left puzzled. She was about to turn her head to look at him when = a gentle tug on her hair called her attention.</p>
<p>Then, the man grabbed her as if holding the reins and thrust vigorously. A strong, slick sound echoed as their lower bodies joined together.</p>
<p>Completely engulfed by him, she felt a mix of shame and excitement in this humiliating position. It felt wrong, yet it felt good.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what to do. He grabbed her chin, mixed his tongue with hers, and licked her swollen lower lip, and only then did she whimper.</p>
<p>“Ah! Richard… ”</p>
<p>“Shhh…”</p>
<p>While gently sweeping her trembling spine, he gripped her hips and continued to pound into her with such force she almost buckled. He filled her each time to the brim, that Jasmin you feel it in her lower abdomen. At every thrust, her fair buttocks danced.</p>
<p>Richard tamed her humiliation with an intense pleasure.</p>
<p>As the climax neared, her hips involuntarily met his strong thrusts, but Richard withdrew, examining her movements intently. Her body trembled with desire.</p>
<p>His laughter echoed.</p>
<p>“I also like riding.”</p>
<p>“Mhhm! Ah! Ah!”</p>
<p>“I don’t have enough exercise.”</p>
<p>He fiercely thrust inside as if he was a ruthless plunderer. Jasmine, with her vision shaking wildly, met the gentle eyes of the horse. She felt as if she had fallen into a beastly illusion.</p>
<p>This feeling intensified when Richard, breathing heavily, pulled her wrists back and held them with one hand. A squelching sound came from both their attached lower regions dripping with warm liquid.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s lips parted, and her body and heart trembled with each passionate intrusion. As the large hands grabbed and molded her swaying brea!sts while incessantly pounding, she felt a tremendous wave of sensation, as if needles were pricking her head in some places.</p>
<p>Wild imaginations of a male mounting a mare in heat, clouded her mind.</p>
<p>In reality, it wasn’t much different. Richard, like a horseman holding reins, gripped her with both hands, erect member rigidly penetrating her body, relentlessly ravishing her as she sobbed at the pleasure.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s waist was bent over in an arch. She was at his mercy.</p>
<p>Their nether regions became more soaked and messy with their love juices. So thick it was that at each thrust, juices bubbled. Her pub!c bone and swollen nub was crushed by his scrotu!m.</p>
<p>It was maddening. A sense of joy and conquest engulfed her brain and lower body.</p>
<p>With each strong thrust, her heaving breas!ts swayed, and sweat dripped from the back of the woman’s flushed body. And when the explosive moment came,</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>She twisted her waist as Richard let out a rough groan. Richard, grinding his teeth, instinctively pulled her wrists closer. His manho0d delved deeply into her, filling her innermost depths with his seed.</p>
<p>The 0rgasm came like a strong, long wave, so he thrust once, riding out the pleasure. Jasmine’s body, caught by his persistent fierceness, convulsed and quivered.</p>
<p>Seeing her sprawled beneath him like a hunted deer brought a mix of embarrassment, tenderness, and a strange sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>The act of sowing his seed deep within her warm confines added to the primal intensity.</p>
<p>He gently moved, slowly pulling out. Then, noticing her shivering shoulders, he embraced her and covered her with his jacket. Semen trickled down from her satisfied hole.</p>
<p>With a touch of mischief, he traced Jasmine’s tear-streaked cheeks. His fingers then gently explored the lower region. He pressed his index finger against the hole, almost as if trying to stop something.</p>
<p>Since Richard himself had been taking contraceptive pills since the first day, this act had no real significance.</p>
<p>He just enjoyed claiming her as his, relishing his scent and the marks left on her.</p>
<p>He couldn’t even understand what kind of childish psychology this was, but how could he stop?</p>
<p>It was da!mn good.</p>
