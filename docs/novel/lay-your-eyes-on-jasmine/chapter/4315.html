            <p><strong>Chapter 22.2</strong></p>
<p><em>“Um, excuse me, but may I dance with you too?”</em></p>
<p>He remembered the face of a bashful girl. Her innocence was a stark contrast to the sensual allure of the woman’s exposed body in front of him. Richard suppressed that thought, thrusting deeply, hard, and fast as he caressed her swaying breasts.</p>
<p>“Oh, oh, oh! Richard! Slowly… ah!”</p>
<p>For some reason, Richard suddenly grew even more excited, like an oil had been put on a fire. He firmly grasped her wrists like reins against her back and thrust even deeper and faster, causing Jasmine to sway helplessly like she was riding a wild horse.</p>
<p>Her taut n!pples bounced. The heated friction of their union felt scorching. AS she felt her release building up, Jasmine’s voice got louder. Their mo*ans filled the room.</p>
<p>Richard felt as though he couldn’t penetrate her deeply enough. Before he realized it, he had positioned both of her legs over his shoulders and continued to thrust downward from above. With her waist partially raised, Jasmine screamed with the intensity of his powerful thrusts and penetration.</p>
<p>She was securely held in his large hands, but the sensation of being plunged was distinct from before. With each thrust, her bottom was slapped until it turned red. His firm pelvis forcefully striking her, the bed creaking, and the man’s groans echoing in her ears made her all dizzy.</p>
<p>After f*cking her senselessly in that position, Richard gently lowered her on the be. Jasmine thought it was over, but his shaft dove into her dripping canal again.</p>
<p>Both breathing heavily, they locked eyes when it was all said and done. Their tongues met in a slow and intimate dance. Their bodies gently moved against each other like puzzle pieces.</p>
<p>Exhausted, Richard released an exhale. He moved his hips back and forth a few times deep inside her.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s cheeks were flushed, and with her lips parted, he inserted his fingers into her mouth, making her suck it before kissing her deeply. It was an animalistic and primal act as if he desired to possess her entire body.</p>
<p>After expending every last drop of his essence inside her, he sighed, kissed Jasmine’s neck, and cradled her head.</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p><em>‘What’s wrong? Why does my head hurt so much?’</em></p>
<p>Jasmine groaned. This hangover wasn’t pleasant. It felt like needles were poking her head. Yet, she was sure she hadn’t that much to be this hungover. Her eyes blinked open.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>The bright surroundings appeared, and she realized she was lying naked in bed. And, one after another, it struck her that she wasn’t alone. An arm of a man beside her draped across her figure. Her legs tangled with the man’s strong thighs.</p>
<p>Jasmine held her breath and slowly released the hand wrapped around her stomach. She turned around and then took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Richard Aion.</p>
<p>Recognizing the unfamiliar face that had slept beside her, the memories of last night rushed over her like a wave. She had been drinking, and she <em>still</em> liked Richard. Then, she lamented on aging as a spinster, gritted her teeth, and had crazy thoughts about taking matters into her own hands…</p>
<p><em>“Do you want to stay with me?”</em></p>
<p>Jasmine, whose face had turned various shades of color, swallowed hard.</p>
<p>From her faintly tingling lower body, the kiss marks to the excessively handsome man lying next to her, this was beyond what she had imagined.</p>
<p>She had thought about it before and had to quit drinking for real this time! Most shocking of all was that she had confessed to him yesterday!</p>
<p><em>“I like you.”</em></p>
<p>Aaah! Die! Jasmine Liovanni, just die!</p>
<p>She screamed in frustration and hurriedly got dressed.</p>
<p><em>Why is he still sleeping on the bed with me? And even if I was a bit tipsy last, he looked perfectly fine. So why did he sleep with me?</em></p>
<p>She looked at him peacefully with half-closed eyes. Disheveled black hair on the pillow, thick eyelashes framing deep-set eyes, and such a sight in a man who looked like a painting.</p>
<p>His face, which had been exhaling rough breaths all night, frowned, and the desire that had deeply penetrated within, along with low moans, suddenly came to mind, making Jasmine’s face turn bright red.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s too good… Ugh, shut up!</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know!”</p>
<p>She clutched her head and muttered as she searched for her underwear. She frowned when she couldn’t find her panties. Where did she even throw it…</p>
<p>“Are you looking for this?</p>
