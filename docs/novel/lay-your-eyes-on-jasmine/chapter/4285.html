            <p><strong>Chapter 37.2</strong></p>
<p>Looking at her cuteness, Richard felt a strange mix of wanting to bite, pinch, tease, and console. He didn’t know that he, too, could feel such impulses.</p>
<p>“Ha, still not enough? Should I feed you more?”</p>
<p>“Don’t say such things…”</p>
<p>Teasing her waist lightly a few times, whether it was stimulation or embarrassment, her face turned red, and she rebuked him. The brave and daring girl who used to boldly approach him seemed to have disappeared.</p>
<p>Jasmine seemed to be subtly shy and showed weakness in explicit matters. How cute. The nasty-tempered Richard deliberately blew wind into her ears.</p>
<p>“So, shall we have se!x every day? Then, later, you’ll probably get wet just by looking into my eyes.”</p>
<p>“Uh! Ah! Richard!”</p>
<p>“… or have you been biting mine all night?”</p>
<p>His lips, murmuring lewd and vulgar words, swallowed up her protesting words.</p>
<p>Her mouth was tightly shut. Her fair legs spread wide on both sides and shook aimlessly. Her breasts heaved, nipples gleamed red with saliva. Her bright purple eyes lost their vividness from the ecstasy, becoming hazy and clouded as he tasted and indulged all of her.</p>
<p>The table crealed, and the teacup and fruits rolled on the floor as their sticky love affair reached a frenzied climax.</p>
<p>Unlike the wobbly table legs that swayed as if they were about to break with the intense force, the strong legs of the lone man remained firm.</p>
<p>Like a predator, his lower body muscles tightened as they thrust back and forth rapidly, each movement accompanied by the squelching sound of wetness. The small feet hanging over the table shivered uncontrollably with each movement.</p>
<p>She panted. Her lips tasted of whipped cream. The sweet flavor from her soft body made him unbearably thirsty. So, he devoured her recklessly like a frantic feast.</p>
<p>He grabbed the woman who was screaming and clinging to him as he filled her with his cream. He squirted the remaining white desire on her half-naked body, like marking his territory.</p>
<p>He let out a sigh of satisfaction. Jasmine’s pure face was now stained. Her man’s lust utterly entranced her.</p>
<p>She looked at him, blinking with a sense of drowsiness, a little irritation, and even absurdity. All the while, sticky fluid dripped down her eyelashes.</p>
<p>Ah, she definitely looked good in white.</p>
<p>Richard smiled with a neat and dignified face that contradicted his dirty thoughts. It was a predatory smile like a beast that had feasted.</p>
<p>“Jil.”</p>
<p>When Jilian raised an eyebrow at the uncommonly intimate address, he calmly declared, “I should propose.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>When the Crown Prince stared at him with a blank look, Richard repeated it kindly.</p>
<p>“I said I should propose. To Lady Jasmine Liovanni.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Would I lie?”</p>
<p>Prince Jilian couldn’t ignore the swirling rumors of their relationship that had sprung up like snowflakes since yesterday. So, he had hoped for something fresh and optimistic, like the two young souls finally officially requesting courtship and perhaps anticipating even better news in the future.</p>
<p>As the rumors of their relationship spread in the social circles and when their bond appropriately strengthened, Prince Jilian planned to gradually show his intentions. He would subtly hint at the Duke about reigniting the matter that had been called off previously.</p>
<p>Wasn’t the morning call today meant to gauge the current progress and discuss how to navigate the upcoming ball to catch the wind? But proposing… already?</p>
<p>Apart from the bombshell declaration, Jilian, observing his casually modest younger cousin, raised his hand subtly. It meant to sit down first.</p>
<p>Richard looked relaxed and full, sitting cross-legged in a gown as if it were his living room. Jilian, who found the flashy expression, which meant ‘I’m dying to do it,’ both funny and embarrassing. He crossed his arms and took a moment to choose what to say.</p>
<p>“It’s welcome news for me, but… are you okay? Isn’t it a bit too soon?”</p>
<p>“Since I’m going to do it anyway, what’s the harm in doing it now?”</p>
<p>As if he was certain that the chaos would unfold like the rising sun in the east, Jilian, bemused, asked,</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea what you’re doing? Just because the Lady likes you doesn’t guarantee she’ll accept. It’s not like you’ve had a track record of successful proposals, have you forgotten your unfortunate military engagement?”</p>
<p>“It’s possible.”</p>
<p>Richard responded, seemingly having already considered that aspect.</p>
<p>“But I’m confident in persuading her. I have no choice, so I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p>The prince’s stern gaze narrowed. Jilian had known Richard for a long time. He had always moved out of duty and responsibility.</p>
<p>But Richard stating, “I’ll do my best,” with his own will, meant he was ready to make a life-changing decision. To go all out.</p>
<p>It was a sincere declaration, a commitment to see it through.</p>
<p>Looking into those determined eyes, it seemed like the madman from the past had returned, and Jilian couldn’t help but feel a chill down his spine.</p>
