            <h3><strong>Chapter 8.2</strong></h3>
<p>Unlucky, unlucky… It was as if nails were piercing his ears. When Richard’s finely arched eyebrows slightly furrowed, Jasmine felt delighted. She wanted to make it worse, to rile him up even more to the point his facade wholly disintegrated.</p>
<p>But the Duke was no pushover either.</p>
<p>“You were known as the belle of high society, but now I see you’re not without your thorns.”</p>
<p>“You also don’t know? You’re always going around smiling like a fool.”</p>
<p>Jasmine snorted and kicked off her uncomfortable shoes. As Richard’s gaze naturally fell on her now-bare feet, he looked away.</p>
<p>“You’re the same way.”</p>
<p>He turned back from the window he had forcibly faced.</p>
<p>“Did you know I knew you had ‘fun’ back in the day?”</p>
<p>Leaning towards him, Jasmine whispered as if sharing a secret. She smirked when his body twitched. Her fingers accidentally poked his firm chest.</p>
<p>“Back in the Academy days. About a year ago, right? People only know you as well-mannered and faultless, but you acted like a rascal back then. Deceiving even the previous Duke.”</p>
<p>Was that so long ago that he had forgotten?</p>
<p>A moment of silence passed. His expression remained blankly composed, but Jasmine could see his inner thoughts.</p>
<p>The cracks in that seemingly impenetrable mask were showing.</p>
<p>Looking straight into his now slightly puzzled blue eyes for the first time, Jasmine grinned gleefully.</p>
<p>“Quite the perfectionist, aren’t you? Who would’ve thought you had that side? Everyone always talks about how perfect and splendid you are. It’s amusing!”</p>
<p>Discovering the mischievous escapades and dark history of Duke Aion, whom no one else knew about, was a mere coincidence.</p>
<p>It was seven years ago, just as her one-sided crush was beginning, and she had taken an interest in his daily life. Jasmine had tagged along to the Academy for her older brother James’ graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>She wanted to catch a glimpse of him, even from a distance. Back then, Richard was still a novice at the Academy, often venturing outside only for family events or significant occasions. Beyond that, he remained hidden within the school walls. It was rare to catch a glimpse of him.</p>
<p>With the anticipation of being able to see him tomorrow, Jasmine had spent a restless night. Feeling like going for a walk or something, she ventured out to the garden and stumbled upon something astonishing.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Someone was climbing over the wall!</p>
<p>The Academy’s annex for guests, where Jasmine had been staying, was a secluded place, so even small sounds echoed loudly.</p>
<p>Could it be a thief? But who would dare commit such a bold act at the Imperial Academy?</p>
<p>After all, it was known to have the best security, second only to the Imperial Palace. Feeling more cautious than before, she gripped her pounding chest and approached closer. She hid behind the bushes, peered through them, and was taken aback.</p>
<p>Ri- Duke Richard?!</p>
<p>The man wore a hood, but his distinguished nose and black hair that peeked out were unmistakably that of Duke Richard. He was with two or three friends, and it seemed like a private gathering.</p>
<p>Was it because of that? His demeanor and speech were far from what one would expect from the usual elegant nobleman.</p>
<p>“Why go all the way there to drink?”</p>
<p>“Then how about drinking here? You’re the one risking your life for points, not us.”</p>
<p>“Ha? Is he on the same level as us? We’re exiled, and the future Duke is here to study.”</p>
<p>“And studious guy is hanging out with us?”</p>
<p>As the two of them chuckled and bantered, Richard’s refined forehead furrowed even more.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to talk nonsense, just quit it.”</p>
<p>“Got it, got it. So uptight.”</p>
<p>Muttering with annoyance, one of the other boys took something out and put it in his mouth. A cigarette? But wasn’t smoking prohibited for Academy students? Jasmine bit her lip and fidgeted with her hands.</p>
<p>Richard looked natural, holding a cigarette between his lips and tilting his head towards his friend, who lit it up. Jasmine stared, almost as if in a trance. He puffed out a short burst of smoke and grinned mischievously. It looked like he was used to it.</p>
<p>The stark contrast between the perfect boy she knew and this different side of Richard left Jasmine confused.</p>
<p>A minor smoking? The Empire’s culture was strict on drinking and smoking until one reached adulthood, even if they were lenient on matters of love. This was undoubtedly an act of rebellion. And to think that Richard, the exemplary and exceptional student, would engage in such behavior…</p>
<p>Seemingly mocking his friend, he said, “He’s not even eighteen yet, and he’s smoking like a chimney.”</p>
<p>“Hey, are you doing well with that girl? Beatrice.”</p>
<p>“Oh, the widow? She was pretty. Wait, Joanna too? Man, this guy.”</p>
<p>“Neither of them are like that.”</p>
<p>“Really? That girl seemed really into it.”</p>
<p>Richard’s handsome eyebrows twitched at one of his friend’s comment. As the other boy was about to say something, Richard’s eyes narrowed in a warning.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to talk trash, stop.”</p>
<p>“Fine, fine. Touchy.”</p>
<p>Ignoring his friend’s murmurs, Richard’s jaw hardened. When his icy gaze made the other person flinch, he let out a puff of smoke and smirked again. There was something unspoken between them.</p>
<p>Jasmine looked at him with an amused smile, her mind racing. “He knows even how to smoke?”</p>
<p>The contrast between his usual demeanor and this debonair attitude fascinated her.</p>
<p>His face revealed a hint of weariness and exhaustion in the faint light. More than the youthfulness typical of his age, his expression exuded a sense of jaded indifference tinged with something heavier. He flicked the cigarette to the ground, crushing it underfoot, and mumbled slowly.</p>
<p>“I don’t engage in irresponsible behavior.”</p>
<p>That was the sort of behavior reserved for trash.</p>
