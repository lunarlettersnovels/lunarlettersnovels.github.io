            <h3><strong>Chapter 45.2</strong></h3>
<p>“It was about five years ago. There was a hunting competition on the Emperor’s birthday. For the first and last time, you didn’t win. The winner was Princess Nysa. She hunted a big bear while you chased after a deer you missed. You spent three days chasing it to the edge of the forest. I remember the Empress scolded you before everyone.”</p>
<p>“<em>‘The Duke doesn’t know when to stop once he’s fixated on something. Seems like he’s got quite the obsession.’</em>”</p>
<p>The Emperor’s words from a few years ago echoed through Jasmine’s lips. Jasmine had a good memory, especially regarding this man. She remembered everything about him because she was curious and wanted to know everything.</p>
<p>Continuing to observe, listen, and replay everything for seven years, she gradually understood the man like a familiar friend. Maybe it was better to observe him from a distance.</p>
<p>“Do you remember your nickname during your academy days?”</p>
<p>A cruel whisper cut through the chilly night air.</p>
<p>“‘The Strange Perfectionist.'”</p>
<p>Indeed, Jasmine loved Richard. Without love, she couldn’t choose the most painful places to poke at him. It was instinctive. Watching his squirming eyebrows as if he was stepped on.</p>
<p>Jasmine clenched her fist. A smile appeared on her face—now, she only wanted to scratch and hurt her opponent. Ironically, she felt like she was wielding a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>“Don’t be mistaken. Right now, it’s just the Duke’s persistent perfectionism kicking in. It’s no different from when you chased that deer for three days, neglecting your rationality and everything else. What’s different from back then?”</p>
<p>“Then why are you so sure it’s the same?” Richard suddenly interjected.</p>
<p>“How can you be so sure that I don’t like you, that I’m delusional, that it’s all fake? How do you know? How can you be so sure? Even I feel like I’m going crazy!”</p>
<p>His face became cruelly distorted as he started to speak faster and faster. As Jasmine stepped back, he approached even more.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am greedy.”</p>
<p>The man, overwhelmed by passion, thoroughly scanned Jasmine from head to toe, his gaze full of greed.</p>
<p>“I want to be the only man to see you. I want the world to know you are mine. When I see you smiling like a child in front of others, I want to take you and lock you up. When other men gaze at you, it drives me crazy. Understand?”</p>
<p>His azure eyes were now uncomfortably close. A flickering glint in those eyes sent shivers down Jasmine’s spine. As she stepped back, the hunter-like figure stuck to her like a shadow and reached out for the tree behind her.</p>
<p>His huge shadow enveloped her. A familiar sense of danger or an unfamiliar warning sent a chill down her spine.</p>
<p>Jasmine sharply exclaimed, “Back off.”</p>
<p>“I like you.”</p>
<p>A quiet statement pierced her ears. Jasmine’s mind momentarily went blank due to the thick emotion in that seemingly calm statement. As Richard, who had whispered into her ear, slightly tilted his head, he whispered again, “I’m so crazy for you.”</p>
<p>“Richard.”</p>
<p>His lips hovered over her trembling ones as if they would touch but refrained. Jasmine felt his bloodshot eyes carefully exploring her face. Richard’s heavy breath spilled over her eyelids like a starving beast controlling its appetite. Despite not touching her with a single finger, it felt as if he was devouring her slowly.</p>
<p>“I still want to fu!ck you.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“When I hold you, nothing else in the world matters at that moment. Anything I’ve built suddenly feels worthless. If you smile, I want to do anything for you, like a servant. And you say this means nothing? Do you know how good it feels to hold you?”</p>
<p>“Move away.”</p>
<p>The sweet words he usually whispered had now turned blatant, provocative, and unrestrained in desire. The raw, savage words were intruding even into her soul. Her eyes stung with embarrassment, and her lower abdomen warmed.</p>
<p>While Richard, looking at her, red at the neck, remained simultaneously pitiful and adorable, wanting to torment her yet hold her, his eyes were filled with affection and a hint of malice.</p>
<p>Beautiful, yet detestable. She was so lovely he wanted to mark her. He wanted to bite those tiny lips that caused him pain. You, you…</p>
<p>He kissed her red earlobes and whispered, “Do we need proof this time too? Shall we try it here? I don’t care if others see or hear.”</p>
<p>“You crazy person.”</p>
<p>When an enraged Jasmine fiercely hit his chest, he withdrew as if pushed away by that small touch. However, his eyes sank even deeper.</p>
<p>“What do I have to do?”</p>
<p><em>What should I do? What should I do…</em></p>
