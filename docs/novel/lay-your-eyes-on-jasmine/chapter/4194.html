            <h3>Chapter 83.1</h3>
<p>“Lady Jasmine, where would you like to go?”</p>
<p>“I just want to walk a bit.”</p>
<p>When Sir Antun, the escort knight, asked politely, Jasmine quietly replied. He nodded and stepped back a few paces. Jasmine walked lightly and entered the old bookstore she had thought of visiting someday.</p>
<p>The worn and faded green sign had ‘Leaf Bookstore’ written in faint golden cursive. With the ringing sound of a bronze bell, the unique smell of paper in the bookstore wafted through the air. She slowly entered the store, savoring the scent of aged ink.</p>
<p>‘Should I read some classic literature after a long time?’ What she had avoided as boring in her childhood was now interesting and enjoyable. Even Jasmine herself couldn’t have imagined she would come to love reading so much. Without a certain trigger, she might not have even tried. It was a blessing.</p>
<p>With a comfortable heart, Jasmine sat by the sunny window corner and put down her parasol. She pulled out a book that caught her eye from the shelf, read the beginning, and then put it down.</p>
<p>‘I’ll read this one thoroughly at home. Since it’s thick, it will be good to read when I can’t sleep.’</p>
<p>She picked one and got up again to look around.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of books, from neatly shelved leather-bound volumes and old newspaper clippings to illustrated fairy tales that are hard to find nowadays. In the tranquil atmosphere of the bookstore, Jasmine felt even more relaxed and selected books that she could collect to her heart’s content.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Then, a book on one side caught her eye. It was a book about herbs, and for some reason, it kept drawing her attention. Was it because she had been busy with Marian’s affairs? Sir Soyer had suddenly started reading medical books.</p>
<p>When Marian heard that he was lying in the infirmary with a cold, she had remarked, “What did he do well to get sick?” but she seemed genuinely concerned and upset. She had even written a letter to the mansion after a long time, instructing the butler to prepare healthy meals for Sir Soyer.</p>
<p>It seems like they could never really get divorced.</p>
<p>Jasmine chuckled softly and reached for the book, but she was startled. A finger had just barely touched the back of her hand. The long, white finger was unfamiliar yet strangely captivating, as if it weren’t entirely new to her.</p>
<p>When Jasmine looked up, she met the eyes of a woman who seemed equally embarrassed, her eyes squinting. The woman had her silver-gray hair tied up high and wore glasses, giving her a cold, northern beauty look. Jasmine quickly scanned her, as was her social habit, and tilted her head in curiosity.</p>
<p>Though she appeared somewhat shabby, the platinum glasses chain, the texture of her coat, the gold-crafted horn buttons, and the handmade shoes were all high-quality materials that only a noble or at least an upper gentry class could afford.</p>
<p>If she had been dressed entirely in expensive clothes from head to toe, Jasmine would have dismissed her as a nouveau riche. However, the woman had an indifferent naturalness, as if she didn’t particularly care about the value of what she wore. Her attitude reflected this as well.</p>
<p>Look at her now. In the capital, most people who encountered someone of Jasmine’s status would either show blatant favor or, even if they didn’t recognize her, would feel an awkwardness from the aura she exuded and keep their distance. But this woman was meeting her gaze directly.</p>
<p>Who is she? I’ve never seen her in the capital’s social circles. Her attire is too free-spirited to be a noble, and she doesn’t seem muscular enough to be a knight.</p>
<p>She doesn’t quite fit the vibe of a gentry either… She seemed like a comfortable person without pretense, yet there was an elegance about her. Her upright posture and expression exuded the dignity and grace of someone well-educated, along with a relaxed ease.</p>
<p>“Are you going to read this book?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>
<p>Could she be a scholar, lawyer, or doctor? Her expression and actions somehow smelt of ink. Jasmine smiled, forming a plausible guess in her mind.</p>
<p>“If it’s a book you really need, would you like to take it?”</p>
<p>“No, well. It’s not that urgent.”</p>
<p>But despite saying that, she couldn’t take her eyes off the book. Finding her actions cute despite her cold impression, Jasmine smiled again and offered.</p>
<p>“I have other books to look at besides this one.”</p>
<p>“You really don’t have to.”</p>
<p>She muttered this but quickly accepted the book and hugged it tightly. Jasmine smiled again. How old could she be? She seemed to be around the same age.</p>
<p>“Are you a doctor by any chance?”</p>
<p>After securing the book, the woman finally faced Jasmine properly, her expression momentarily enigmatic. It looked as if she was deep in thought. Does she know me? Even if she did, it wouldn’t be surprising. To Jasmine’s question, she replied coolly.</p>
<p>“In a way, yes.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Is that a yes or a no? As Jasmine tilted her head in confusion, the woman suddenly asked an unexpected question.</p>
<p>“Have you ever been to Watt’s Bakery on 5th Avenue Gerante?”</p>
<p>“What? No?”</p>
<p>A bakery, out of nowhere? Where is this conversation going? Jasmine felt bewildered.</p>
<p>Regardless, without any change in her expression, the woman took out her pocket watch to check the time and then smiled.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>“At 3 o’clock, fresh bread and cookies come out, and they taste amazing. You should try them.”</p>
<p>“Oh… thank you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for letting me have the book. See you next time, Lady Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Goodbye.”</p>
<p>Jasmine responded in a daze and watched the woman quickly leave. The woman’s high ponytail of silver-gray hair gleamed.</p>
