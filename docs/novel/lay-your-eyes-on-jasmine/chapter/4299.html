            <p><strong>Chapter 30.2</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine’s friends told her that during the early stages of a relationship, the world appeared pink, and everything was exciting. She, however, wasn’t feeling quite like that.</p>
<p>Upon closer reflection, wasn’t it a bit much or too little compared to her friends’ experiences?</p>
<p>After all, it had been seven years. Her first love since her girlhood. Now, her earnest wish had come true. But why did her warm feelings of love feel so empty and worrying?</p>
<p>Sleeping together was nice, but, in truth, it wasn’t just 1%. There was a faintly bitter aftertaste, like coffee. It grew little by little with each encounter.</p>
<p>Why was that? Why?</p>
<p>Jasmine kept pondering. If only she had friends to talk to, even a casual conversation would suffice. Unfortunately, this villa had no close acquaintances.</p>
<p>Maybe she had set her expectations too high. Perhaps she had dreamt of a fairytale-like romance. Or maybe she felt awkward and unfamiliar because it was all new to her. She blamed herself for thinking that way.</p>
<p>However, she soon snapped out of it. No, right? Her parents said that if she feels bad and loses her temper, it’s the situation or the other person’s fault.</p>
<p>A grown-up and good-hearted person like herself hadn’t done anything wrong. If she had, she would have felt guilty and apologized immediately. Let’s say she had unrealistic fantasies. Isn’t it natural for her to have expected it?</p>
<p>A strong-willed person with unwavering self-esteem, Jasmine, who had been through seven years of secret admiration, quickly pouted.</p>
<p><em>‘Right! It’s not my fault! Then why do I feel so bad, as if I couldn’t eat another macaron?!’</em></p>
<p>So, to assess the situation and the other party more objectively, she focused.</p>
<p>First of all, situation-wise, instead of going through the basic course of confessing, dating, and getting closer to each other, and then finally making love—as she had imagined—she hastily skipped the middle step!</p>
<p>Jasmine never imagined that she would spend the night with Richard. It happened to be like that, but it was true that their relationship developed suddenly and was more passionate and exciting than a regular one, but it was less stable.</p>
<p>Well, to be precise, if Jasmine and Richard’s relationship had appeared as horizontal and equal as it looked, or if Jasmine had been more immune to romance, it wouldn’t have felt less stable.</p>
<p>Jasmine was so wrapped up in the situation that she couldn’t see through all of this at once, but she subconsciously sensed that this wasn’t completely what she had hoped for.</p>
<p>And then, Richard.</p>
<p>Whenever she thought about him, her heart would race, and she’d feel a burning sensation. Now, though, a faint sense of lingering seemed to throb. It was as if the impression of his fiery image had been etched into her body, making her slightly troubled.</p>
<p>It was hard for her to come to her senses. She tightly pressed her lips together.</p>
<p>So, Richard… affectionate and kind. He always came at her like a wild beast and an amazing kisser. They communicate better than expected. Richard is more mischievous than he looks and secretly has a bad-boy personality. But, in the end, he always smiled warmly at her.</p>
<p>All the time she spent with him was wonderful. S3x, kissing, tea time, or the secret glances exchanged. The best part of it all was when they shared brief, honest conversations with their hands intertwined after a session of lovemaking.</p>
<p>It might have been a short period, but during those moments, Jasmine felt extremely happy and thought that things were just fine as they were. She liked his loving gaze, his smile filled with playfulness and tenderness…</p>
<p>It felt like something tangible, yet just out of reach. She often found herself nibbling on her nails, then suddenly opened her eyes.</p>
<p><em>“You said you like me. Was that a lie?”</em></p>
<p><em>“You’re truly lovely.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It feels a waste that someone like you would like me.”</em></p>
<p>Richard, who seemed more affectionate and expressive than he appeared, frequently showered Jasmine with compliments like “You’re pretty,” “You’re cute,” or “You’re lovely.”</p>
<p>When no one was watching, he’d embrace or put her on his lap, tenderly sweep her hair, make eye contact, or kiss her on the cheek. He’d hold her hand as if he were unsatisfied with even the slightest distance between them.</p>
<p>With the attitude and expressions he displayed, everyone who saw him would think that he was completely infatuated with Jasmine and couldn’t break away from her.</p>
<p>Jasmine thought about it as well. <em>‘Doesn’t this man like me so much?’</em></p>
<p>It was difficult to deny Richard’s overflowing affection and the deepening affection in his gaze. The reason why Jasmine was certain that Richard’s feelings were less than hers was because she had no reason to be certain of his feelings.</p>
<p>Jasmine had seen plenty of men and women who clung to each other as if they couldn’t live without each other after going to bed.</p>
<p>Even when not in a romantic relationship, some passionately pursued a brief moment of play, like a one-time fling. They would act fervently as if they would die if they were separated, only to walk past each other the next day as if they were strangers or soon to find new lovers and eventually get married.</p>
<p>Jasmine had often seen this phenomenon, even though she couldn’t comprehend it. But what could she do? It was a reality.</p>
