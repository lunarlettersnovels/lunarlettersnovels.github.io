            <h3>Chapter 62.1</h3>
<p>After meeting for the first time in six months, they stood frozen, staring at each other.</p>
<p>Jasmine, with her more tanned and gaunt face than before, slightly shorter hair, blue eyes, and a perfectly matching sharp blue coat, stared at him for a long time as if trying to grasp onto him.</p>
<p>Jasmine stared at him for a long time, captivated. He looked cooler and sharper with his tanned, gaunt face and slightly shorter hair. His stylish navy coat matched his blue eyes perfectly.</p>
<p>She noticed the slight parting of his lips, the tension in his jaw, and the veins bulging on the back of his hand as he clenched and unclenched his fist.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to read the shifting expressions on his face, so she quickly turned her head.</p>
<p>‘Calm down. Nothing surprising. I was expecting this.’</p>
<p>But she hadn’t expected to meet him like this.</p>
<p>Jasmine tried to act nonchalant on the outside. She bit her inner cheek and grasped the edge of her skirt. Her fingers were cold.</p>
<p>Her first thought upon seeing him after six months was, “He lost a lot of weight, huh?” It was amusing.</p>
<p>Whether that’s the case or not, what did it matter? He’s a complete stranger now.</p>
<p>“Lord Peterson, I’m sorry. I should go first.”</p>
<p>She was so focused on him that she had forgotten she was in the midst of breaking up. Jasmine forced a smile and got up from her seat.</p>
<p>She wanted to leave this place quickly. Although unlikely, if he happened to say something or try to stop her, or even worse, greet her, she felt it would be even more uncomfortable than it already was.</p>
<p>However, contrary to her expectations, Richard was not the one who blocked her path.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, wait a moment.”</p>
<p>When her wrist was grabbed, Jasmine frowned but quickly composed herself. Peterson looked at her with an unfamiliar expression.</p>
<p>Jasmine felt an ominous premonition and tried to pull her arm away reflexively, but his grip was too strong. She furrowed her brow at the tingling pain.</p>
<p>“Hey, let go of this…!”</p>
<p>“Is it common to tell something like this so suddenly? What did I do wrong? What don’t you like about me? Whether it’s my face or my family background, I’m better than the men you’ve replaced me with. Why are you suddenly rejecting me?”</p>
<p>Jasmine clicked her tongue. Peterson had a sour face as if his pride had just been kicked. How misleading. You can really never know people just by looking at them.</p>
<p>She advised with a sigh, “Mr. Peterson, let go of me. I’m saying this nicely.”</p>
<p>“No, this is not the case! No matter if you’re part of the grand duchy, you treat people like this… I only told you good things. Are you ignoring our Marquis family?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Jasmine was dumbfounded, not out of anger but because she found it absurd. It was ridiculous to see someone who used to be polite and gentlemanly behaving like this.</p>
<p>Moreover, it wasn’t like they had been through a marriage proposal or something; it was just a few dates.</p>
<p>“Lord Peterson, come to your senses. I think you’re making a huge mistake. You have no right or reason to demand anything from me. Do you think we’re in some kind of significant relationship? What do you know about me? Aren’t you embarrassed to call us lovers?”</p>
<p>“We are in love…!”</p>
<p>“…Of course not. In love? Me?”</p>
<p>Jasmine truly forgot where she was, who she was dealing with, and who was watching. She laughed cynically, feeling both ridiculous and shocked. Her face was so cold, as if a chilly wind had blown past it.</p>
<p>“You are wrong. You knew from the start that we wouldn’t be able to meet for long. But you still met with me. I should have said that from the beginning. Let’s not burden each other. Haven’t you already heard from other people, Lord Peterson?”</p>
<p>Her final words were rather gentle, almost to the point of being dismissive. The intention wasn’t any different.</p>
<p>Jasmine was genuinely annoyed for the first time in a while. Actually, she was most annoyed with herself. She felt like she had experienced this before.</p>
<p>Why does she make so much little progress?</p>
<p>“Ugh, I can’t stand it.”</p>
<p>She was too irritated to be angry. Jasmine twisted the man’s arm, grabbing the inside of his elbow with all her strength. As his hand loosened with a scream, she smirked insincerely.</p>
<p>“I have no sense of judgment for people, so I’ll pass this rude behavior as an accident. Have a cup of tea and regain your senses. Think about who you’re demanding things from right now.”</p>
<p>Feeling dirty as if she had just been covered with filth, Jasmine wanted to splash some tea on him right away. But it seemed like a lesson that she should stop this meaningless activity. She sighed.</p>
<p>Brushing her hair aside, she sighed and turned away from the table with a refreshed face. For a moment, it felt like she met someone’s eyes again, but she ignored it.</p>
<p>But just then, she felt a dull grip on her shoulder. Jasmine turned around, her face twisted. She felt like kicking him in the gro!n.</p>
<p>In the next moment, she sensed something rushing forward, and the unpleasant hand on her shoulder was immediately thrown aside. Her view was blocked by a broad back.</p>
<p>Huh? She blinked rapidly.</p>
<p>The familiar scent, the familiar silhouette, pierced through all her senses. Like a strong perfume suddenly wafting under one’s nose. Overwhelmed by it all, Jasmine was momentarily mesmerized.</p>
