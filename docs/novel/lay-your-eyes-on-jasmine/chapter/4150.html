            <p><strong>Chapter 105.2</strong></p>
<p>Looking at Richard’s utterly composed face, Jasmine felt defiant. It hadn’t even been a day since this man had boldly declared he would accommodate everything for her.</p>
<p>Being good? Not manipulating? Easy to say. But is he even capable of that? Irritated by what she sensed beneath his confident facade, she provoked him directly.</p>
<p>“You think I’ll end up marrying you no matter what, don’t you?”</p>
<p>When she asked with widened eyes, Richard’s lower eyelid twitched. He sighed softly.</p>
<p>“How dare I have such an arrogant thought…”</p>
<p>“Or you’re probably plotting ways to make it happen. That’s what you want.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not true.”</p>
<p>Richard answered firmly, but both of them realized it was a lie the moment it left his mouth. Jasmine moistened her dry lips while meeting his blue eyes as he lied without changing expression. Why was she remembering that moment from half a year ago now, of all times?</p>
<p>“What do my feelings matter? I’m the best man in the entire empire to suit you and satisfy you. I guarantee there’s no one better than me.”</p>
<p>“You say you love me.”</p>
<p>“If you love me, choose me first. Think wisely. Consider what’s more beneficial.”</p>
<p>Sometimes during their arguments, a devilish competitive spirit would coil and rise within her. Though she didn’t know why it always turned out this way, this man had a talent for drawing out fiery emotions she didn’t even know existed within herself.</p>
<p>Jasmine smiled seductively. As Richard flinched and curled his index finger at her smile, beautiful like a blooming rose, another bombshell dropped.</p>
<p>“Fine. Let’s say I marry you.”</p>
<p>“What? Really?”</p>
<p>“Jasmine!”</p>
<p>Regardless of her family’s surprise, Jasmine smiled brightly at the frozen Richard. Though his eyes trembled with inevitable emotion, there was anxiety lurking in one corner.</p>
<p>Looking straight into those eyes, Jasmine called out to the fidgeting Grand Duke.</p>
<p>“Father, does our family need an immediate marriage?”</p>
<p>“What? Of course not! If you’re feeling pressured, don’t worry about it at all, darling.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>Jasmine said, grinning like a carefree girl.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll date as my heart desires, meet all sorts of different people, and marry when I want to.”</p>
<p>Amidst the shock, only Jasmine remained cheerful as she asked casually. That’s okay, right? Under the collective gaze of the Grand Duke’s family, Richard appeared outwardly unchanged from his usual self. At least, that’s how it looked on the surface.</p>
<p>His upturned lips, doll-like, were as elegant as a well-crafted statue. When he covered his eyes and started laughing “hahaha,” Caras cast a suspicious glance, wondering if Richard had lost his mind from shock.</p>
<p>After a brief laugh that stopped abruptly, Richard responded politely and kindly.</p>
<p>“Go ahead. I’ll wait. For however long.”</p>
<p>But Jasmine felt a chill in her heart as she saw his bloodshot blue eyes staring intently at her. As she realized he was truly angry, a thrill of excitement welled up in a corner of her heart.</p>
<p>Ah. A sigh escaped. Her once pure affection was no longer just affection. Perhaps the current Jasmine wasn’t loving him as he was, but rather feeling a love-hate relationship.</p>
<p>“As long as you choose me in the end, I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“You’re quite confident. Or is it broad-mindedness? Seems you’re generous about your future wife’s past.”</p>
<p>“No. It’s begging.”</p>
<p>If only you would choose me this way… I’ll endure even that wretched situation.</p>
<p>“What wouldn’t I endure if you’d become my wife?”</p>
<p>However, regardless of the sincerity behind those words, Richard wondered if he could really tolerate seeing Jasmine holding someone else’s hand, calling them her lover, right in front of him.</p>
<p>Of course, the answer to that was obvious.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“So are we officially lovers now?”</p>
<p>That was what Richard asked straightaway when he visited the next day, as if by appointment.</p>
<p>After he’d left, Jasmine had been pestered by her family, then tossed and turned all night, and now, half-dreaming, she’d barely washed her face before being dragged out. As she was yawning softly, she tilted her head in confusion, “Huh?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You said you felt the same way, that you wanted to get to know me better.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I want to get to know this person better.”</p>
<p>That’s what she had said. After a night’s sleep and regaining her senses, Jasmine adjusted her shawl, crossed her arms, and sighed. Ah, I really need to stop being so emotionally impulsive.</p>
<p>But he was the same way. She had clearly expressed her skeptical feelings and suggested starting slowly, but what’s this about being lovers? He came rushing the very next day, ready to seal the deal.</p>
<p>Jasmine responded indifferently while blowing on her tea.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you didn’t care what I did before marriage as long as I married you? So why do we need to date already?”</p>
<p>“Then do you intend to marry me?”</p>
<p>“Well, if I were to marry, there probably isn’t a better choice than you in the entire empire.”</p>
<p>She said it casually, but Richard fell silent for a moment at that response. Wondering what was wrong, she looked up to find him staring at her with an unreadable expression.</p>
<p>“What? Do you have something to say?”</p>
<p>“No. Just thinking how awful those words sound, even though they were mine.”</p>
