            <p><b>Chapter 3.2</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…That’s what she thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Greet him. This is my academy junior, Richard Aion, the Duke of Aion. Richard, this is my younger sister, Jasmine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine blinked in a daze. It didn’t feel real. But it wasn’t false either. If anyone had an authoritative say concerning Richard Aion, it was Jasmine, the world’s foremost expert in his doctoral studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His neatly combed black hair, his blue eyes, his elegant and handsome face – it all shone just as brightly as before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He seemed paler and more contemplative than usual, but as Jasmine, the fool, saw him up close again, her heart raced </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">again</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretending not to see, with her face slightly averted, she shot a sly look at her older brother James, who was beaming proudly at them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James had manipulated the situation so they could meet privately, but who asked for this? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enough of this unrequited love, she thought.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like I’ll finally stop this crush!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she couldn’t say the words she had prepared, even though she had dressed up meticulously from head to toe when he suggested they go together to meet the duke. Jasmine was only surprised and taken aback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past few days, she had been holed up at home, drowning her sorrows in ice cream while wearing casual clothes, delving into music and books about unrequited love, and trying to endure the end of her long-lasting love in her own way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then James suddenly urged her to get ready to go out. His insistence was enough to make Jasmine sway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The momentum that had built up over seven years was truly frightening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing him up close like this is the first time since last year’s party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After courteously greeting him, Jasmine looked at the sideline where Richard was conversing with her older brother James. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was certain. He seemed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">off </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What could be the matter? He used to be so composed that he hardly showed any signs of distress, but Jasmine was sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, even while discussing practical matters with James about their academy mentorship, he occasionally seemed to be lost in thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jasmine, sorry. Did I startle you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As James playfully winked one eye, Jasmine awkwardly pursed her lips. If they were at home, she would have retorted, “Isn’t that obvious? Where did your manners go?” But now, Richard was discreetly observing them, siblings. She responded gracefully with a ladylike demeanor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, it’s not that. You’re both involved in official matters, so there must be a reason.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not a big deal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard was undoubtedly a gentleman. Even if he claimed not to care, he was conscientious enough to feel responsible and apologetic for not properly engaging with a lady, even briefly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been a while, Lady Liovanni. You’re still as beautiful as ever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These calm and composed words were a greeting. Yet, her heart raced endlessly. He, whom people had always surrounded, was now looking at her alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine felt the promise she had made to herself over the past few days, like brainwashing, that she wouldn’t like him anymore, was already faltering.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is dangerous.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine smiled, slightly lowering her gaze. She muttered softly, “Is that so? Thank you, Your Grace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, by the way, have you two met before?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James, observing them, asked, and Richard replied, “I remember dancing with her at the year-end party two years ago.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Jasmine lifted her teacup to hide her flustered state, she almost choked on her tea. When she looked up, she saw him casually waving away the teacup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His long fingers and the shadow of his lowered eyelashes looked like something out of a painting. She knew he had a good memory and was considerate. She knew it was customary manners… She knew all that, but still, she couldn’t help feeling a surge of anticipation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine felt pitifully small in moments like these.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Was that so? You have an impressive memory. Our Jasmine must have been quite charming.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was an honor to have such a splendid lady in my presence.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How could he be so faultless?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her admiration and excitement came a growing sense of melancholy. It was truly a picture-perfect scene. And just as affectionate and kind-hearted James remained blissfully unaware of his sister’s turmoil, he conveniently stood up at that moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I forgot that an officer left some documents behind. Can you stay here for a moment? I’ll quickly sort it out and return.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh no!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jasmine mentally screamed at James as he winked at her. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where are you going, leaving me alone? Don’t go! I said don’t go! Don’t you dare leave your precious sister’s heart vulnerable to that handsome thief again! Hey, you scoundrel! Who in their right mind entrusts their sister’s precious heart to a heart-stealer?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, oblivious to her intense gaze and inner growls, James cheerfully whistled and left the scene. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just wait, I’ll get to you later. I’ll tear your hair out.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Jasmine grumbled inwardly, she swallowed hard in the oddly hushed atmosphere surrounding her. Aside from a few distant bird calls, the serene garden, the blue sky, and beneath it, the handsome man with cool, icy eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just the two of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to do? What should she say?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though this was the moment she had rehearsed countless times during those seven years of endless contemplation, her mind went completely blank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, before she could awkwardly begin, Richard, gazing at her with clear eyes, spoke first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jasmine Liovanni, my lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-yes! Why did you call for me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine’s response was a bit hasty, and she realized a moment later that she had muttered that to herself. She let out a sigh of relief. Thankfully, she didn’t make a complete fool of herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She composed her expression gracefully and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please, go ahead, Your Grace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope this doesn’t sound intrusive, but I’m not very skilled at turning words around.”</span></p>
