            <p><strong>Chapter 23.2</strong></p>
<p>A tingling sensation coursed through her. He came close just enough for his eyelashes to brush her face. His eyes bore into her own.</p>
<p>And then, he said, as if making her remember, “You said you liked me, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>“Was it a lie?”</p>
<p>As his lips pursed, Jasmine shouted back, torn between excuses and a sudden rush of emotions.</p>
<p>“Wh-who would lie about something like that?”</p>
<p>“Well, Jasmine, you’re not that kind of person.” <em>I know because I’ve seen it,</em> his face seemed to say.</p>
<p>Jasmine realized where this sense of discomfort was coming from. It was a tension similar to when they had a confrontation inside the carriage before. But the next moment, Richard’s gaze became calmer. It was a face that was familiar and polite, and this time, there was a touch of warmth.</p>
<p>“Are you genuinely struggling to remember, or are you intentionally feigning ignorance? It can only be one of the two options.”</p>
<p>At his statement, Jasmine’s shoulders shrank. Nevertheless, he kept smoothing her hair. It was a soothing, affectionate touch.</p>
<p>“Is it the former or the latter?” He checked her face and said, “But it seems like you remember vividly, so maybe it’s the latter…?”</p>
<p>“I’m not feigning ignorance!”</p>
<p>This person seemed upset. Jasmine, who noticed it quickly, grabbed his wrist.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m just a bit surprised. I had a few drinks, so I got emotional last night.”</p>
<p>He looked down at her hand, which he had briefly held. As if on cue, he intertwined his fingers with hers, causing Jasmine to catch her breath. The warm morning sunlight shone down on them, reflecting the dust floating in the air and making it almost sparkle.</p>
<p>With slightly wrinkled brows, Richard traced the pulse on Jasmine’s wrist and the back of her hand with his thick thumb. His soft and low voice echoed in her ear.</p>
<p>“I feel the same way.”</p>
<p>She was breathless.</p>
<p>“It was a side of me that wasn’t like me.”</p>
<p><em>What could he be thinking?</em> Jasmine peered at him shyly. Although they were both unfamiliar with it, there was no regret or remorse about what happened between them.</p>
<p>His gentle touch on her cheek felt warm and comforting. She unconsciously brushed her cheek against his, and he stood still, looking down at her intently. His long eyelashes, blue eyes, sharp nose, and lips—looked mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Likewise, Richard looked at her as if she were a newly blossomed rose bathed in the morning’s golden sunlight.</p>
<p>As if they had made a silent promise without anyone saying who should do it first, they drew to each other, their lips meeting.</p>
<p>Warm honey pooled at her lower belly.</p>
<p>It felt passionate, sweet, euphoric, and sensual… When he embraced her firm neck and felt his strong hands wrapping around her waist as if he had been waiting for it, her head was spinning with excitement.</p>
<p>Yes. Being with this person, doing this, felt so good that it seemed insane. And it didn’t seem like it was just her thought; her body heated up in thrill.</p>
<p><em>‘Oh, is it just me? Am I the only one feeling this way?’</em></p>
<p>She couldn’t tell. Jasmine was overwhelmed by her own emotions. So, with feverish eyes, she held his neck tightly, looking at him passionately, not realizing that her appearance was igniting his desire.</p>
<p>Richard thought she was like a small bird. He squeezed her cheeks and kissed her plump and soft lips repeatedly.</p>
<p>The woman in front of him seemed strangely adorable. Her emotions were transparent, and she came across as incredibly blunt, embracing him openly, saying she liked him, asking him to like her too. Her naive eyes made her endearing.</p>
<p>Richard had never seen anyone be so confident and wholehearted about their emotions.</p>
<p>Of course, he had never been one himself. So, he found it fascinating. He wanted to understand. How could she be so honest in every moment?</p>
<p>Many people are true to their desires. Richard had never liked those who couldn’t restrain themselves. But what set Jasmine apart was that he found it neither annoying nor offensive but rather charming.</p>
<p>What was the difference? What made her special?</p>
<p>At this moment, he couldn’t tell. He only knew he wanted her.</p>
<p>He wanted to claim her under the bright light. Under the open, in a way that couldn’t be forgotten.</p>
<p>He tilted his head again to kiss her, pulling aside the loosely draped sheets around their bodies.</p>
<p>As he touched her fair skin, her flesh tingled with pleasure as if voicing a yearning for him. Richard gently squeezed her soft bottom, his breath becoming shallow and hot.</p>
<p>Their bodies slowly entangle, their legs subtly teasing each other. Jasmine let out a soft m*an against Richard’s lips. He ran his index finger along her neck, clearly feeling her excitement.</p>
<p>Perhaps because it was morning, the sensations felt more pronounced and intimate. No, it was the same for him.</p>
