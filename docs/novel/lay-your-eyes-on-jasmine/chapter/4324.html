            <p><strong>Chapter 18.1</strong></p>
<p>“Ha, it’s a big deal.  We are a perfect fit for bed, but we do not communicate.”</p>
<p>“It’s just like we were asleep.”</p>
<p>“You haven’t even had your first kiss yet? Oh, my Jasmine is a baby.”</p>
<p>The way Jasmine’s friends talked about each other’s relationships and those eyes fixed on her, as they didn’t quite understand how she was ignorant of these matters. They made it seem so easy, repeatedly breaking up and getting back together.</p>
<p><em>What’s so easy about it anyway?</em></p>
<p><em>No, if it’s just nothing, what can’t I do it?</em></p>
<p>Jasmine squinted at the dancing lovers.</p>
<p>Of course, unrequited love included imagining love and physical contact with the man of her dreams. It wasn’t a wild and intense fantasy; instead, it was a tender, romantic one.</p>
<p>However, apart from that, she had never imagined any other kind of contact with the opposite sex. In fact, her brain rejected the idea. It made her uncomfortable.</p>
<p><em>This is why I can’t have a proper relationship. I can’t go on like this.</em></p>
<p><em>“You know, I’ve realized I’ve never said this to you before.” </em>A serious and confident confession about an unrequited love.</p>
<p><em>“I mean, it happens; some couples go straight to bed the moment they lock eyes.”</em></p>
<p><em>Why can’t I do that?</em> Frustration sets in.</p>
<p><em>“I don’t think it’s worth compromising your dignity because of someone you don’t like.”</em></p>
<p>And then,</p>
<p><em>“You are my friend’s sister and the only lady of the Duke’s family. We can’t let such a lady return without her dignity. Please consider my perspective as well.”</em></p>
<p>Richard’s scolding is full of adult-like reasoning and a face that can be pretty annoying.</p>
<p>Her alcohol intake had reached its limit, mixing with the pent-up emotions, and exploded.</p>
<p>Jasmine placed the empty wine bottle on the table with a thud. Sometime during this, she’d grabbed it without pouring it into a glass, and the strength to even hold the bottle was slipping from her hand.</p>
<p>Richard Aion…</p>
<p><em>“It would be wise to drink in moderation in the future. Isn’t it risky for a young lady to wander around absentmindedly and get involved in accidents?”</em></p>
<p>Yeah, right. Show me how dangerous being “intoxicated” can be. Her vivid purple eyes gleamed strangely.</p>
<p><em>I’ll make you fall for me tonight.<br>
</em><br>
***</p>
<p>Richard clenched his fist, fixated on the whiskey glass with melting ice. The wall in front, despite its cool colors, concealed his tangled thoughts.</p>
<p>Jilian, flashing only a sly smile, had known Richard since his mischievous childhood days. He couldn’t help but notice his confusion.</p>
<p>“Lord Aion.”</p>
<p>Richard didn’t respond, perhaps ignoring him.</p>
<p>“Hey, Duke.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Richard.”</p>
<p>He playfully nudged Richard’s leg under the table.</p>
<p>“Stubborn as ever, huh, little brother? Can’t even talk when you’re in love?”</p>
<p>Only then did Richard, vexed by his mischievous cousin, look up at him and rubbed his temples. Unbeknownst to him, the surroundings had emptied, perhaps prompted by the Prince’s signal. He sighed deeply.</p>
<p>“Why, again.”</p>
<p>“What’s going on with you and the lady? Seems like you’re in a good mood.”</p>
<p>Richard turned his head slightly, giving his cousin, the troublemaker, a critical look. “Nothing. She looks happy.”</p>
<p>“Well, neither of you seems entirely honest. Considering the rumors of your ‘parting,’ you two look quite close.”</p>
<p>“She’s just a kind person.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“Could you stop prying?”</p>
<p>“Oh, well.” Jilian raised his eyebrows, amused. He had grown considerably since the days when he teased him relentlessly.</p>
<p>A war hero and a chivalrous knight, despite receiving praise, Richard remained in his eyes as the grown-up version of the cheeky kid who used to pester him. Jilian chuckled mischievously and propped his chin on his hand.</p>
<p>His seemingly cold demeanor turned charming when he smiled, and the crow’s feet around his eyes gave him an endearing look. Unlike the straightforward and unpredictable stepsister, he was like a completely different person.</p>
<p>“You’re just so frustrating, that’s why you are the way you are. You can’t help it as your sister’s the only one left. Both our uncle and aunt have passed away, and your sister couldn’t care less if you grow old alone.”</p>
<p>“Risha is not the type to bother with unnecessary matters.”</p>
<p>Jilian pursed his lips, looking at him as if blaming him.</p>
<p>“It’s not like that. If you end up without an heir, you’d be leaving the massive family responsibility to Risha alone.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Even in the Liovanni family, with your character and looks, there’s no shortage of matches. Don’t be stubborn and get married before someone else does. It’s not like what happened with Lily.”</p>
<p>“Please, refrain from making such remarks.”</p>
<p>Jilian laughed mockingly, as if amused.</p>
<p>“It’s the former that went up to the auction, but the latter? She’s available.” Jilian said, distinguishing Lily as the former and Jasmine as the latter.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
