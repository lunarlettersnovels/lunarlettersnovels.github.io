            <p><strong>Chapter 6.1</strong></p>
<p>“I did it last time. I’m going to drink it all at once. You’re a weak drinker. How could you believe that you can do as well!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay because you are here, brother.”</p>
<p>“Words.”</p>
<p>Tsking, Caras moistened his tongue, sighed, and finished his wine in one go. He then placed the empty glass on the tray carried by a passing waiter. Following that, there was an entertaining animal trick circus that added to the party’s excitement, and Jasmine burst into laughter, clapping her hands with gusto as she drank</p>
<p>Although Caras kept making sarcastic remarks, Jasmine surreptitiously drank quite a bit. As the slightly buzzed feeling set in, she watched with an amused glint in her eyes as couples exchanged flirtatious glances and moved to the terrace or garden.</p>
<p>After that, she turned her attention to her swordplay-impassioned (or foolish?) older brother Caras, who was intensely observing the dancer performing martial arts.</p>
<p><em>It seems like my brother left me alone. He came here by himself or with his friends perhaps. As for I… Even if I wanted to have fun, I have to act all proper as if I came with my parents.</em></p>
<p>Jasmine realized this just as she was about to pout her lips.</p>
<p>“Jasmine!”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Either the tiger is coming to talk, or something. Startled by the sudden embrace from behind, Jasmine turned around with a playful shout.</p>
<p>“Nicky!”</p>
<p>“What’s going on here? You came alone? Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
<p>With her orange-red hair and emerald eyes, Nicky, a beautiful girl resembling a cat, was one of Jasmine’s friends who went well with her.</p>
<p>Due to various commitments like studying abroad, family succession, and marriage within their group, they hadn’t met much recently, so this unexpected encounter was truly joyful.</p>
<p>“Yes, just for a change of mood.”</p>
<p>“You little rebel. So, you finally discovered the joys of staying out at night? Why did you always leave early, insisting on studying and taking etiquette classes? Oh, by any chance, did Duke Aion come and that’s why you’re here? Where is he?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that.”</p>
<p>Jasmine corrected her slightly extended neck and her pursed lips, returning to her usual expression with a crooked smile. That darn Duke Aion, Richard, Richard! Even Nicky herself couldn’t help but mention Duke Aion whenever she saw her. How much of a commotion had she caused for people around her to be like this?</p>
<p>“I don’t like him anymore.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Nicky’s mouth hung open.</p>
<p>“What are you saying? Are you expressing your intention to retire from the social scene in that manner?”</p>
<p>“…It’s about that level.”</p>
<p>“No way, from the time when our heads were full of dreams, you were steadfast in your devotion. Why would you suddenly change?”</p>
<p>“Just because…”</p>
<p>Nicky was now managing her inherited perfume business from her mother.</p>
<p>Having just returned from abroad, she remained unaware that all hopes for an engagement between Jasmine and Duke Aion had vanished. Jasmine pursed her lips and sighed.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you later. It’s a bit complicated. Anyway, I won’t be seeing that person anymore.”</p>
<p>Nicky, quick to pick up on the story from Jasmine’s expression and demeanor, nodded without pressing for more details. Instead, she hugged her friend tightly and said,</p>
<p>“You did well! Yeah, it’s foolish to give everything to a man just because you’re a woman. Those kind of pushovers should be discarded! A person should have some self-respect! Let’s be independent from men… Who’s that?”</p>
<p>As Jasmine and Nicky held hands, giggling and hopping around like mischievous children, Caras approached them from behind and raised an eyebrow. Nicky’s expression instantly changed. It was like her emotions could be seen even through a mask…</p>
<p>“Oh, hello. Are you Duke Caras? I’m Nicole Valrand, daughter of Marquess Valrand. I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p>
<p>Looking down at the shyly smiling girl, Jasmine blinked her eyes in disbelief. Who was this? Just a moment ago, she was acting all helpless and defenseless.</p>
<p>“Oh, Marquess Valrand. It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you remember me?”</p>
<p>“Of course. My sister’s friend is particularly beautiful.”</p>
<p>“Ah.” Nicky’s ears were as red as her hair. As the two people ended their polite conversation, Jasmine whispered into Nicky’s ear as soon as her brother turned away.</p>
<p>“Who said that giving everything to a man just because you’re a woman is foolish?”</p>
<p>“Well, each to their own. Caras is a different case. He’s on a level above most men.”</p>
<p>Nicky retorted quickly without a hint of hesitation. As the heir to the Empire’s top perfumer and a savvy businessperson, she wasn’t one to mince words. Jasmine pursed her lips.</p>
<p>“Do you still have a crush on my brother? Fond childhood memories?”</p>
<p>“Well, I thought I was past that. Until today.”</p>
<p>Jasmine raised an eyebrow at her, tongue-in-cheek. Looking at Nicky, who couldn’t seem to take her eyes off her brother, even after seven years of unrequited love, Jasmine couldn’t help but chuckle. Those eyes were indeed filled with an unwavering devotion.</p>
<p>Even if she were to engage in courtly romance, she wasn’t one to easily give her heart away.</p>
<p>When Nicky was a child, she would watch the then younger Caras swing a sword near the training ground and be at a loss for words, thinking it looked cool.</p>
<p>Little did Nicky know that even now, he would have this effect on her.</p>
<p>Amidst the back and forth between Nicky’s subtly admiring glances and her oblivious, sword-loving fellow knights engaging in geeky conversations, Jasmine sighed.</p>
<p>“While it’s great that you are not so popular, have you considered the possibility of attracting unwanted attention from strangers? It’s important to stay safe.</p>
<p>Even in her haste, Nicky was still worrying about Jasmine’s well-being. She truly was a good friend. Though her body was turned towards Jasmine, her gaze was still fixed on Caras.</p>
