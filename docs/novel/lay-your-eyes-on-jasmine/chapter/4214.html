            <h3>Chapter 73.1</h3>
<p>“…What about the underwear?”</p>
<p>“He says he was wearing military underwear because he got all sweaty during training. Don’t make me laugh. Ever since we got together, he said he’d get rashes if he didn’t wear the underwear I embroidered with his initials! Can a superstition change overnight?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah. But did his behavior change suddenly?”</p>
<p>Ignoring the previous comments, Jasmine furrowed her brow. Though she wasn’t married, she’d heard enough stories about typical behaviors of men having affairs.</p>
<p>Even Lichang, still reeling from the realization, glanced over at Marian, who was still sobbing, and said in a low voice, “It could be true, though.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Well, regardless of everything else, if he suddenly stopped expressing his li.bido, then it means he’s getting it elsewhere. Men can’t live without it. They’re all the same in that regard.”</p>
<p>Listening to Lichang’s cold perspective, Jasmine felt her faith in humanity slipping away. Seriously, this was the last thing she wanted to know. She let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>“So, what are ddwe going to do now?”</p>
<p>Marian, chewing on a cucumber, propped one knee up on her chair and gave a bitter laugh. She looked like a mother and wife who had weathered countless storms, and her expression was a mix of solemnity and sadness.</p>
<p>“What can I do? If it’s true, I can’t live with him.”</p>
<p>“What? Are you really going to get a divorce?”</p>
<p>Despite expecting it, Jasmine was still shocked by Marian’s determination. She knew how deeply Marian loved her husband.</p>
<p>“Are you sure? Can you really live without him?”</p>
<p>“It’s not okay, but what choice do I have? Life goes on. Jasmine, there’s nothing in the world you can’t do.”</p>
<p>Her calm voice, despite her haggard appearance, reminded Jasmine of the girl who defiantly looked up when her family fell apart, and her mother ran off with the butler. Yeah, Marian had always been like this. Jasmine felt a bit relieved.</p>
<p>“It’ll hurt, but how can I live with someone who betrayed me? That’s the worst. You saw how I cut off my mother.”</p>
<p>Just as Jasmine cut off anyone who didn’t respect her, Marian never forgave those who betrayed her.</p>
<p>Years later, when Marian’s mother heard about the birth of her grandchild, she sent a tearful, apologetic letter. Marian burned it without batting an eye.</p>
<p>Even Jasmine was momentarily shocked by her ruthlessness but understood her immediately. How Marian had been stung by her mother’s terrible abandonment when she needed her most.</p>
<p>Not all families are flesh and blood. There were plenty of families worse than strangers, and it was better to cut off toxic relationships. Parent-child relationships were just another part of human interactions.</p>
<p>To insist on maintaining family ties without understanding the other’s position was selfish and presumptuous.</p>
<p>Jasmine gently patted Marian’s forehead with a mix of pity and admiration.</p>
<p>“You’re the strongest person I know.”</p>
<p>“I know. Thanks for the compliment.”</p>
<p>Marian snapped off a piece of cucumber and chewed it, giving a thumbs-up. Despite looking quite impressive, her red, rabbit-like eyes made it a bit funny. Jasmine chuckled and changed the subject.</p>
<p>“What about Joshua? Is he still with your aunt?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I can’t trust that man. A cheating basta.rd isn’t going to care for his child.”</p>
<p>Jasmine pondered for a moment, tapping the table. Given the situation, she needed to consider various variables and possibilities.</p>
<p>Her knowledge of law, learned as part of her liberal arts education, flashed through her mind like a book.</p>
<p>Divoerces between nobles were usually complex, but if the fault was clear, the process favored the wronged spouse. The main issue would be the child. Custody battles could be exhausting. She snapped her fingers and said,</p>
<p>“If it goes to court, let me know. I’ll get you the best lawyer in the capital.”</p>
<p>“They’re expensive. Are you going to cover the legal fees?”</p>
<p>“The lawyer is from our family’s firm. Just let me know.”</p>
<p>“Jasmine, I love you.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>The two friends expressed their affection for each other while munching on cucumbers and carrots. Jasmine dipped a cucumber generously in mayonnaise, propped her chin on her hand, and casually asked,</p>
<p>“If you do get a divorce, what will you do?”</p>
<p>“First, I’m going to squeeze a lot of money out of that man and go traveling. I’ve been so busy that I’ve never had a proper vacation. The last trip I had was our honeymoon. Isn’t that just too much?”</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh. What was Sir Soyer doing all that time?”</p>
<p>“He was always busy. I was at home taking care of the kids and managing the estate.”</p>
<p>Marian spoke calmly, but it was impossible not to feel a pang of bitterness. They started their married life against the objections of their families and received little support.</p>
