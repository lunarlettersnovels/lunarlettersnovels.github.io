            <p><strong>Chapter 108.2</strong></p>
<p>But that man, who’d been helplessly provoked, seemed particularly bothered by her past relationships now.</p>
<p>Worrying about the past was just self-destructive. Meaningless.</p>
<p>With some dating experience now, Jasmine knew what constituted taboos in relationships. It’s better to leave the past in the past.</p>
<p>After all, what’s past is past, and if it’s not affecting the present, it’s best to let it lie. Unnecessarily reviving what’s gone, dwelling on it, imagining things, and reproaching your lover only damages the relationship.</p>
<p>For the person being interrogated, it’s frustrating and unpleasant to be suspected and made jealous when they’ve done nothing wrong, strictly speaking, and it becomes exhaustingly pointless.</p>
<p>Yes, Jasmine had experienced that too. It was truly exhausting. Because comforting didn’t end it, and there was nothing you could really do about it. How could you remove a rival who exists only in imagination?</p>
<p>But in this case, she’d partly brought it on herself, and seeing them actually talking was different, wasn’t it? He couldn’t possibly feel good about it. Though she and Richard weren’t officially back together yet, she felt it wasn’t proper. Mmm… Jasmine let out a small groan.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you had to see that earlier.”</p>
<p>She shifted her gaze slightly, embarrassed to meet Richard’s knowing eyes.</p>
<p>“Sorry for getting irritated when you said it bothered you. Even considering my circumstances, I guess it must have looked like I was flirting with an ex.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think that.”</p>
<p>I thought he was hitting on you. Richard muttered his unspoken thoughts.</p>
<p>Jasmine stared at his visibly relaxed face for a while, then after much deliberation, spoke what she’d been hesitating to say.</p>
<p>“And to answer what you’re most curious about, I didn’t sleep with Raymond.”</p>
<p>“Pffft!”</p>
<p>Richard, who had been drinking water for his dry mouth, coughed violently. Fortunately, Jasmine was fine as he reflexively turned away, but she gaped in surprise.</p>
<p>It was quite a sight to see his face turn bright red as he covered his mouth, coughing repeatedly. Jasmine, feeling bewildered, incredulous, and somewhat worried, let out a nervous laugh, asked if he was okay, and got up to go to his side and pat his back.</p>
<p>Instead of accepting his insistence that he was fine, she ordered a wet towel, napkins, and a new water glass from the waiter. Only after gulping down an entire glass of water did Richard seem to calm down, pressing his forehead firmly. Jasmine watched him and asked,</p>
<p>“Are you okay now?”</p>
<p>“Yes… no, I mean… so, uh, you didn’t?”</p>
<p>Seeing him immediately ask and then sheepishly gauge her reaction, Jasmine almost laughed again. Was that so important and curious to him? Though she found his persistence exasperating, there was something bewildering yet cute about him acting like a child, eyes sparkling in uncertainty. She smiled again with amusement.</p>
<p>“No. I’m telling you this so you don’t torture yourself with unnecessary thoughts.”</p>
<p>“…I feel somewhat ashamed that that’s not entirely wrong.”</p>
<p>Though Richard spoke a bit dejectedly, his mood had clearly improved. His face brightened up after maintaining an artificial smile like a porcelain doll. Jasmine’s lips twitched again, finding it amusing. At times like this, he really does show he’s a man too. So simple. And a bit cute, actually.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why someone like you, who doesn’t seem the type, is so jealous.”</p>
<p>This time, even Richard seemed at a loss for words, opening and closing his mouth before rubbing his forehead and sighing.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I think it’s because this is the first time I’ve truly wanted to possess something.”</p>
<p>“I’m your first?”</p>
<p>“Among living things.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>That can’t be true. Jasmine briefly considered bringing up Lily. Wouldn’t it be fair to expose his past since she’d exposed hers? As she was contemplating this, Richard spoke first.</p>
<p>“I want to confirm you’re mine, want you to definitely be mine, and want everyone to know that so they won’t dare desire you. So obvious and certain that no one would doubt it. Actually, I want to be the only one who sees you, the only one who touches you. Is that too strange?”</p>
<p>Seeming to think he’d revealed too much, he glanced cautiously at Jasmine. However, his words led Jasmine to different thoughts. Even half a year ago, when their emotions had run high, he had said something similar.</p>
<p>“I wish I were the only one who could see you, and I wish the whole world knew you were mine. When I see you laughing like a child in front of others, I want to take you away and lock you up, and I go crazy seeing men glancing at you. You know?”</p>
<p>Now it seemed those weren’t metaphors but his genuine feelings to the bone. Jasmine looked at Richard as he watched her carefully. Such a gentle face, yet inside, so full of possessiveness.</p>
<p>Seeing this, it wasn’t entirely strange that the previous Jasmine had misunderstood his feelings as mere physical desire or ambition rather than love. Who could have predicted that this calm, polite symbol of chivalry would be the embodiment of jealousy and obsession when it came to love?</p>
