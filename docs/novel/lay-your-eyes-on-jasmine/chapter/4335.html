            <p><strong>Chapter 12.2</strong></p>
<p>So, it wasn’t uncommon to see noblemen gathered, chatting and joking while enjoying the music. They appeared youthful, possibly academy students or individuals who had not yet inherited their family titles.</p>
<p>Even though there wasn’t much of an age difference between him and them, Richard chuckled lightly at the sight of these young and inexperienced gentlemen.  Then, he continued walking past them.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t heard a familiar name, it would have been just another scene.</p>
<p>“Charles, how is she? Lady Liovanni, I mean.”</p>
<p>“She’s nothing short of the belle of society. Lucky devil.”</p>
<p>Among the cheering and whistling crowd, there was a young man with a somewhat embarrassed expression.</p>
<p>Upon noticing the man, Richard’s steps involuntarily came to a halt. He found himself unconsciously fixated on him, even though he didn’t understand why. It was a behavior driven by instinct.</p>
<p>The rather neatly dressed and presentable young man, Charles, wore a well-fitted navy suit. He was shorter than Richard, but he had a lively demeanor.</p>
<p>Objectively, Charles possessed the kind of outgoing charm that women would find appealing, and without realizing it, Richard found himself mentally comparing the young man to Jasmine. He narrowed his eyes slightly.</p>
<p><em>Really? That man and Jasmine?</em></p>
<p>No matter how much he thought about it, they didn’t seem like a suitable match.</p>
<p>However, it wouldn’t make sense for Charles to refer to someone else since there was only one Lady Liovanni. Furthermore, her private life was so impeccable that there had never been any scandals.</p>
<p>She was famous for her unwavering affection for the Duke. Many tried to win her over, but few held their attention for her exclusively.</p>
<p>Richard wrinkled his brow in a strange feeling that suddenly came over him.</p>
<p><em>What is this feeling?</em></p>
<p>“She’s truly beautiful,” Charles said.</p>
<p>For some reason, Richard’s mind flashed back to Jasmine’s face, the way she glared angrily at him, her fiery gaze, and the violet eyes that had once scrutinized him. At the same time, his chest tightened.</p>
<p>As Charles continued to discuss Jasmine with the others, Richard inexplicably found himself listening intently. It was an unusual behavior for him, as he usually had no interest in idle gossip.</p>
<p>“Miss Jasmine is not just a lady with a beautiful face. Her words are kind, she doesn’t behave arrogantly despite her noble status, and she always considers others. Her heart is as pure as silk! I’m truly fortunate.”</p>
<p>Charles seemed utterly infatuated with Lady Liovanni. His face turned red, and his eyes sparkled with passion.</p>
<p>Well, Lady Liovanni was undoubtedly the belle of society. It wasn’t surprising that a young man like Charles would be smitten with her. Her reputation in society was impeccable.</p>
<p>However, Richard was bothered by the choice of words, particularly the phrase “doesn’t behave arrogantly.” Although the speaker seemed unaware, even a slight change in tone or expression could be interpreted differently in this social circle.</p>
<p>Especially among unmarried aristocratic young ladies, those of Jasmine’s status, who maintained both a noble position and a spotless private life, were exceedingly rare.</p>
<p>She was a flower on the precipice, an unattainable beauty that no one could overlook. If there was Duke Aion on one side, then Lady Jasmine of Liovanni was on the opposite end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>In other words, if Richard was the center of excessive attention and expectations from everyone, Jasmine might be even more so. Her youthful and blossoming beauty would surely draw more attention than him.</p>
<p>And if she had entered her first romantic relationship, it was only natural that everyone would be curious about her relationship.</p>
<p>Like a pack of wolves gathered around a piece of meat, they all had expressions of excitement.</p>
<p>They must be envious of her for holding hands with a man for the first time, slightly jealous, filled with heated rivalry, and, especially as men, there was some curiosity.</p>
<p>How would those words<em> “doesn’t behave arrogantly”</em> be interpreted by those people?</p>
<p>Richard frowned at this thought, even though he usually had no interest in such matters. It was an incredibly unusual behavior for him, but he couldn’t help himself.</p>
<p>With his fist clenched, he stared into space for a moment, but when he saw his expression reflected in the opposite mirror, he was briefly surprised. He had thought he was wearing a blank expression, but his eyes were chillingly cold as if he were slightly irritated.</p>
<p>“I’ve decided to visit my estate this time, and it’s a big deal. I should make a good impression on her.”</p>
<p>Estate? Even if he had one, what difference would it make in Lady Jasmine’s eyes, especially when he wasn’t even the heir to her family? They were already going to the estate together? So soon? How long had it been since they first met?</p>
