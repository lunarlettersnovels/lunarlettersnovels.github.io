            <h3>Chapter 84.1</h3>
<p>Jasmine had always wondered how a large man could laugh like a child.</p>
<p>On the surface, he appeared cold and stern, but when he smiled, his dimples would form as if melting ice, making him look like an undeniably lovable boy. It was different from when he just laughed heartily out of joy.</p>
<p>When he looked at her with those eyes, a corner of her heart would burn as if it had been scorched.</p>
<p>Ah, come to think of it, that woman earlier…</p>
<p>“Why did you buy so much bread?”</p>
<p>“Well, it just happened.”</p>
<p>Jasmine awkwardly smiled, embarrassed as she held a basket full of bread as if she were stockpiling emergency rations for a war. Richard, who had been quietly watching her, reached out his hand. Before she could react, his thumb touched her lips. He briefly rubbed and then withdrew.</p>
<p>The light touch felt unusually light as if a petal had brushed against her and then fallen away.</p>
<p>“You had some cream on you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right.”</p>
<p>Jasmine flinched and took out a handkerchief to carefully wipe her mouth. It must have been from the cream bread she had eaten earlier. How embarrassing. She muttered to herself, then directed her gaze to the bread roll he held.</p>
<p>“Please, eat it. They say it’s the best in this bakery.”</p>
<p>“Can I?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>It was bread she might have thrown away if it hadn’t been for him. Richard alternated his gaze between the bread and her, then thanked her and smiled again. Oh, really. She wanted to tell him to stop smiling like that. But she held back, knowing it would only make her look foolish.</p>
<p>Feeling annoyed, Jasmine glared at him as he broke the bread into two pieces. He was too handsome, and it irritated her. Then, suddenly, he offered her a piece of the bread, catching her off guard. She shook her head in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“No, I’m fine…”</p>
<p>“Eat it. You seemed to have waited a long time.”</p>
<p>He smiled again. Feeling somewhat helpless, Jasmine accepted it. When he saw him take a big bite with a hearty appetite, despite his noble appearance, she followed suit.</p>
<p>Her mouth was filled with a subtle sweetness and softness. It was delicious—and sweet—excessively so. In reality, it was perfectly delicious and not overly sweet, but it just felt sweeter. As she chewed, she mumbled.</p>
<p>“I want some milk.”</p>
<p>Bread rolls should be eaten with milk. Isn’t that the rule? Absentmindedly seeking agreement, she looked at the person beside her, only to find he had disappeared.</p>
<p>What? Where did he go? She was flustered, but then she spotted him a little distance away, buying something from a boy with a bread cart. When Richard quickly returned, he was holding a bottle of milk.</p>
<p>“This is freshly squeezed from this morning. We’re lucky.”</p>
<p>Jasmine stared at the milk bottle without responding, and when she didn’t take it, she looked at his smiling eyes as he waved it at her again. She had no choice but to accept it.</p>
<p>The cap was already unscrewed, making it easy to drink. The fresh, creamy milk slid down her throat. It was delicious. And, indeed, excessively so.</p>
<p>“How is it? Is your throat no longer dry?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Richard, you should have some too.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Richard watched her with a curious expression for a moment, then opened his mouth to speak but closed it again. Then he smiled once more, this time a bit faintly. It was a complex expression mixed with a hint of embarrassment and regret.</p>
<p>The square had become crowded by now, and people were continuously passing by them. Richard diverted his attention.</p>
<p>“There are too many people here. We should move to a different spot.”</p>
<p>Before she could react, he had taken the bag of bread from her and placed a careful hand on her shoulder. It was a gentle and respectful touch, like a mother bird protecting her chick.</p>
<p>Even if it hadn’t been him, her escort knight, Sir Antun, who was always nearby, would have done the same. Such gestures of escort and consideration were routine for Jasmine, and this kind of physical contact wasn’t particularly special.</p>
<p>But the man himself was not part of her routine, and that made all the difference.</p>
<p>Half-embraced by him as they walked, Jasmine caught his distinctive, refreshing scent. It was a comforting and soothing fragrance. When they reached a bench by the river, he released his arm and handed the bag of bread back to her.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you liked bread this much.”</p>
<p>“I like it a bit. Today, it’s more like taste testing.”</p>
<p>Jasmine replied somewhat sheepishly. Richard, despite his cheerful and easygoing nature, always saw Jasmine as a neat and charming lady. He recalled the image of her earlier with sugar and cream on her lips but chose not to mention it.</p>
<p>“That place is quite famous, it seems.”</p>
<p>“Is it? I didn’t know.”</p>
<p>“Neither did I.”</p>
<p>If someone hadn’t told him today, Richard wouldn’t have known about this bakery in the capital either. And if that someone hadn’t mentioned Jasmine’s name along with the bakery’s location, he wouldn’t have rushed here, throwing on his coat in haste.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Jasmine asked him about it.</p>
<p>“How did you come all the way here, Duke? Is that bakery really that famous?”</p>
<p>She’s calling me ‘Duke’ again, Richard thought bitterly.</p>
<p>“My sister recommended that I visit. She doesn’t make idle suggestions.”</p>
<p>“Oh, your sister must be in town.”</p>
<p>Jasmine murmured, recalling Richard’s sister, Risha, whom she had heard about before. Even in social circles, she was a figure shrouded in mystery.</p>
