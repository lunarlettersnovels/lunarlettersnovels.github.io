            <h3><strong>Chapter 42.1</strong></h3>
<p>Jasmine felt a shiver crawl down her spine at the low, raspy voice that whispered into her ears. Her breath quickened, and her heart, once quiet, began to thump loudly with confusion or tension—it was hard to tell. Once again, she closed her eyes tightly.</p>
<p>“Just a moment like this.”</p>
<p>Richard, exhaling a long breath, brushed the tip of his nose against Jasmine’s hair.</p>
<p>“It’s not that difficult, right? Hmm?”</p>
<p>Contrary to his rough voice, his hand, whispering like a plea, was chillingly cold, as if he had been standing in the cold wind for a long time.</p>
<p>Jasmine knew this well from the countless times that hand had touched and caressed her. Contrary to expectations, Richard’s body temperature was higher than one would think.</p>
<p>He easily gets hot, so he often slept without covering himself with a blanket. Jasmine, who clung to him tightly in such moments, couldn’t understand how someone with so much warmth could endure wearing the knight’s uniform all the time.</p>
<p>If a person’s hand felt this cold, then what about… even in early summer, this place surrounded by the forest became surprisingly cool and chilly in the evenings.</p>
<p>“How long have you been here?”</p>
<p>“Your maid said you were resting.”</p>
<p>Although she had heard that Mari had come an hour ago, the time she had waited from then until now felt quite long. While Jasmine leisurely enjoyed her meal, wrote a letter, and felt uneasy about this complicated relationship, why was he persistently seeking her?</p>
<p>Jasmine bit her lip and pulled away from him. Uncomfortable emotions surged as she looked at his pale face.</p>
<p>This was why she tried not to see him. It’s hard to maintainin her composure in front of this person.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>However, instead of a retort, Jasmine let out a sigh. She felt sorry and uneasy; it wasn’t a pleasant feeling. She rubbed her forehead and mumbled.</p>
<p>“I sent you a letter to meet tomorrow. Did you receive it?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“But why…”</p>
<p>However, Richard, who had been staring at her intently, talked about something else.</p>
<p>“How’s your body?”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“Are you okay now?”</p>
<p>Jasmine opened and closed her mouth. There was both much and little to say.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Then, may I kiss you?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Before she could properly respond, his large shadow covered her, and his palm cupped her cheek. Her lips were engulfed without a chance to push away.</p>
<p>A large arm caught her waist as she tried to retreat in surprise. Hot breath rushed into her mouth. Fingers parted her startled lips as his tongue delved deep into a kiss.</p>
<p>The sensation was tingling, almost predatory, and yet tender and careful. It was both overwhelming and gentle, making Jasmine wonder how such contradictory impressions could come from a man of such imposing stature.</p>
<p>She was pushed back one step at a time until her back hit the wall. Richard, pushing her against it, turned his head and deepened the kiss even more. He exhaled a short breath.</p>
<p>His neck throbbed as if he found it difficult to control himself. His fingers held her cheek greedily as their breaths mingled wildly on this midsummer night. His large hand, resting on the wall above Jasmine’s head, once again swept down from her neck to her spine, brushing against her tailbone as if by chance.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>As intended, a soft m0an escaped from Jasmine at the teasing sensation.</p>
<p>Her small, bewildered face was incredibly charming. Richard gently sprayed kisses on her face. Her fragrance filled the air, saturating his whole body and teasing his nerves with the pleasant aroma. Jasmine’s scent was absolutely delightful—sweet, subtle, and comfortable.</p>
<p>It was maddening to be forcibly separated from this smell. Richard buried his nose in her soft, fair neck and inhaled her scent deeply.</p>
<p>Jasmine wrapped her arms around his shoulders as he frantically dug his nose into her skin like a released beast. She felt her head tingle from the sensual temptation he made her feel.</p>
<p>It was a familiar pattern. Despite the pleasure that made her heart flutter, Jasmine pushed him away.</p>
<p>“Richard, just a moment….”</p>
<p>Jasmine gasped when she felt something solid standing halfway up her lower body. Despite his stoic and gentlemanly face, Richard never bothered to hide his passion and excitement from her. And she never refused or failed to give in to his blatant temptations.</p>
<p>But today, Jasmine didn’t want to share a bed with him.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>Her firm words echoed through the corridor. Richard, who had been softly nibbling on her ear, his face buried in her hair and fragrance lingering, paused.</p>
<p>A stillness settled between them as they locked eyes. Richard discreetly composed his excitement. At least, that’s how it seemed externally. He kissed Jasmine’s forehead more politely.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. Did I startle you?”</p>
<p>“A bit.”</p>
