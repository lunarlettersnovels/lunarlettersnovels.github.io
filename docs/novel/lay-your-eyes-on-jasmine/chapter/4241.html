            <h3>Chapter 59.2</h3>
<p>Hazy steam rose as overflowing water poured out. Richard leaned against the hot tub, his arm resting on his forehead. He gazed absently at the reflected light and the misty particles floating in the air.</p>
<p>Despite the hot water washing the contours and additional scars on his sculpted upper body, he didn’t feel hot.</p>
<p>Despite being back in the imperial capital, at the Duke’s mansion, after escaping the sticky blood, heat, flesh, and tension of war—he still felt as if nothing had changed, as if everything was just as before.</p>
<p>This wasn’t his first war. He had fought even more intense battles, larger-scale wars.</p>
<p>Afterward, there was always a sense of extreme fatigue and exhaustion, yet there was also relief and fulfillment in completing his duty and responsibility. However, this time, even that was faint.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it was his most successful and fastest achievement, yet it felt ordinary. Even if he spent sleepless nights pushing through. Even if he resorted to force to finish the job.</p>
<p>After winning the war, he always indulged in a glass of old wine from the cupboard—his secret pleasure. Upon returning to his territory after a long absence, he also enjoyed the sight of this noble land and mansion, inherited from his ancestors and father, quietly gleaming under the night sky.</p>
<p>In truth, Richard loved this time. As his boiling blood slowed, he savored the calm and reflected on each accomplishment—there was satisfaction in everything operating smoothly and perfectly within his domain.</p>
<p>The life he managed and achieved. This right and beautiful balance.</p>
<p>But if asked if he would resume his routines as before, his answer would be an immediate no.</p>
<p>Nothing was yet perfect or resolved. Where exactly was this satisfaction supposed to come from?</p>
<p>Even now, feeling stifled, with waves of unease rising in his chest, he pushed aside and managed it like a habit.</p>
<p>Richard chuckled wryly, wiping his sweat-drenched face with his wet hands. His seemingly impassive, distorted face exhaled hot breath. The familiar monster within him that he had grown too accustomed to, twisted and writhed.</p>
<p>It was easy to stomach when he was solely focused on victory in the midst of life and death. However, ironically, after leaving the dangerous battlefield and returning to daily life, all the things he had suppressed for so long began resurfacing.</p>
<p>One name that immediately rose to his consciousness stood out.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>As he sang it aloud, it felt unfamiliar due to the passage of time. The awkwardness only intensified his feelings of despair.</p>
<p>At one point, the name that once felt like his own seemed unfamiliar. Of course, he had no choice but to admit it.</p>
<p>Too much time had passed. Not just a month or two, but half a year.</p>
<p>Yet, that was the best Richard could achieve with his abilities. Despite being a remarkable achievement, he felt regretful every moment.</p>
<p>If only he had returned sooner, he would have met her already.</p>
<p>What would have happened then? Would we have talked? Would you have forgiven me and accepted me?</p>
<p>Maybe. Despite how cruelly she turned and abandoned him, it was in her nature to be kind and forgiving.</p>
<p>If they had met at a better time, perhaps those absurd misunderstandings and conflicts would have been resolved long ago.</p>
<p>At the time, he was in a situation where he didn’t know what to do, but as time passed, that, too, felt nothing. Still, the unresolved resentment between them, whether regret or resentment, remained more vivid during this period.</p>
<p>If there were any lingering emotions, positive or negative, reconnecting would have been easy.</p>
<p>But the present Richard found himself standing still in an awkward time yet again.</p>
<p>He didn’t know where to start or what he would say if he met her. No, rather, would she even agree to meet him first?</p>
<p>Richard realized something again. Feeling lost and helpless was truly miserable. He hadn’t felt so powerless in his life before.</p>
<p>He almost wished he were alone, besieged by enemies on the battlefield. His pride in his reason and strategic mind had only led to incorrect answers and more questions.</p>
<p>Lying beneath the makeshift tent on the battlefield, he would think about it hundreds of times, yet he didn’t know. What excuses to make? How to persuade her.</p>
<p>In reality, their relationship was likely nearing its end.</p>
<p>He couldn’t accept it.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, when Richard stood in the garden that night and watched Jasmine turn around, he couldn’t take a single step forward.</p>
<p>Surprised and sickened by his reaction, he realized that, as she had put it, he was so trapped in it that he couldn’t break free.</p>
