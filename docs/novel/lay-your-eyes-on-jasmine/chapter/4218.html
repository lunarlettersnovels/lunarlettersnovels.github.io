            <h3>Chapter 71.1</h3>
<p>For a while, as they tipped their glasses back and forth, Richard finally spoke when he was appropriately tipsy.</p>
<p>“It all started with that misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>Thus began Richard’s revelations of unspoken matters he had faced. These were stories he couldn’t casually share anywhere. Nysa listened with rare seriousness while Risha, usually adept at tossing out remarks, quietly chewed on her meat, listening intently.</p>
<p>As the conversation flowed past the scorching summer and sudden downpours to even the war, the only sound besides Richard’s voice was the quiet breathing. There was a stifled silence after the confession ended.</p>
<p>“Ughh…”</p>
<p>Nysa groaned deeply, running her hand over her forehead.</p>
<p>“So, you were deeply involved with Lady Jasmine? I had no idea it was that serious.”</p>
<p>Nysa was aware of the scandal—she glanced at Risha, whose reaction wasn’t much different. No, she couldn’t know. Isn’t it impossible for this brother and sister to write and report each other’s pain in a heartfelt letter?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with Richard’s long-awaited love story unfolding in such darkness, Nysa felt a mixture of amusement, fascination, and a twinge of pity. Just as his first love ended in disappointment, why was his next love in such disarray? The perfect guy was great at everything but couldn’t manage the most crucial thing.</p>
<p>“How did things get so tangled? Even the cold war with your sister has its reasons.”</p>
<p>“Wow, did my brother really tell Her Higness that? Amazing. He must really like her.”</p>
<p>Initially amused, Risha now seemed somewhat surprised. It was strange, but her brother’s feelings were genuine. Even so, this scandal was truly unwarranted.</p>
<p>“I thought it was out of character for him because he had a crush on Lily for a long time, but I guess there was a real connection.”</p>
<p>Not to disparage his feelings, but in Risha’s view, the former had a powerful influence on Richard. She’d never seen Richard so distraught and disturbed. Anyway, isn’t it human nature not to wish unhappiness upon one’s own flesh and blood?</p>
<p>After thinking for a moment, she said, “My advice is the same as before. Conversation is key. No matter how skilled Prince Charming is, nothing will change unless the Lady’s heart moves. Even if His Majesty actively encourages it, the other side is no easy target. It’s a noble family, after all.</p>
<p>Risha continued, “In this situation, neither strategic negotiation nor power pressure will work. They even said that Lady Jasmine is dearly cherished by her family. Hm, there’s no solution.”</p>
<p>“Well, what did you say?”</p>
<p>When Nysa asked her question, Richard, tilting his glass, smirked.</p>
<p>“Ah, right. She told me to analyze the cause or something.”</p>
<p>“No, I want you to think more systematically and analytically. Why did that woman dump you? Why did her heart scorn you? Why does she hesitate and refuse to meet again? Analyze the cause to formulate a response strategy. Imagine this as a strategy room and the opponent’s fortress to attack.”</p>
<p>Why did she leave?</p>
<p>There were many reasons. Over time, Richard admitted that he had acted too impatiently, given the lack of trust between them. It was something he had reluctantly come to understand after much thinking.</p>
<p>Because he believed in Jasmine’s sincere and warm affection like iron, the clear and deep duration of her unwavering affection for him all throughout those years… So maybe he was being complacent. This, too, was probably arrogance. Yes, a very great arrogance.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand that either. You didn’t even say a word to her but told someone else that important thing? Where’s her consent in that? When did she ask for that?”</p>
<p>Why did he think she would want the same thing? He hastily concluded and pushed ahead due to the passion he first felt.</p>
<p>She probably felt like she wasn’t respected and felt like she was being handled. That’s probably right. He regretted it several times.</p>
<p>Nysa, who glanced at Richard’s dark eyes, cautiously said.</p>
<p>“It’s a well-known fact that the Lady has long liked you, right? However, breaking up with you, I don’t think it was an easy task.”</p>
<p>Richard’s face twisted. From what he’d seen, Jasmine was sweet and kind, but when it came to cutting, she had a ruthless edge like a knife. It was so relentless that it left him shaken. He tried to understand how she could do such a thing, but she hadn’t behaved strangely.</p>
<p>It was not strange for someone who had been born, raised, and educated as a high noble to be so sweet and ruthless at the same time. After all, Richard was the same.</p>
<p>Still, it didn’t lessen the blow. He wondered why he didn’t see it coming, why he had been so foolish not to know her patience and limits.</p>
