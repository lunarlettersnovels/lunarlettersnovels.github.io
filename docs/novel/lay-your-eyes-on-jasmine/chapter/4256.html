            <p><strong>Chapter 52.1</strong></p>
<p>Richard Aion conceals his true preferences, only finding satisfaction when he can see, touch, and privately consume all information and knowledge. He has always treated his favorites this way.</p>
<p>However, for the first time, a ‘human’ is included in his favorites.</p>
<p>The outcome might have been similar even if an arranged marriage bound them. Still, it could have been a better situation. She likes him, and he’s infatuated. It would have been nice if they could get to know each other through normal means.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s safe to say that Jilian’s hope for an alliance with the Liovanni family has vanished. Unless, by some miracle, Jasmine changes her mind.</p>
<p>It would be a loss for Jilian, but more than that, it would be a shame for his cousin to lose her because of him. He might be cynical, but he still cares for Richard.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’m sorry. My words caused this. Do you want me to take responsibility and call the lady to explain the situation?”</p>
<p>“No. Her trust in me is at an all-time low, so she might think I asked you to do it,” Richard replied evenly.</p>
<p>“What have you done to make it that bad…? Has she figured out that you’re a jerk?”</p>
<p>Jilian asked seriously, genuinely concerned and not teasing. Richard’s mouth dropped open. It was a painful question.</p>
<p>Why was her trust so low? Needless to say, it was his fault.</p>
<p>He had prioritized his security and greed over Jasmine’s thoughts and anxieties and failed to fulfill her need for reassurance. When she had exhausted herself and tried to leave him, he had pushed back with despicable force to keep her there.</p>
<p>He could still see the look on Jasmine’s face, the hurt in her eyes. His heart burned.</p>
<p>As he stood in the rain, staring into the distance at the raging river, Richard thought and thought and thought, his mind running cold. The question never left his mind.</p>
<p>What exactly had he done wrong, what terrible mistakes had he made, from what moment, how and why, why, why, why, why.</p>
<p>Why did she leave him?</p>
<p>He was sure she liked him.</p>
<p><em>‘No… does she still like me? Does she even want to see me again? If you really say you don’t have any regrets, then… What shall I do?’</em></p>
<p>“Richard. Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Jilian’s voice was serious this time. Richard, momentarily distracted by the growing chorus of voices in his head, glanced up at the Crown Prince, whose eyes narrowed in seriousness.</p>
<p>It was the first time since his distant childhood that he had seen genuine concern for him from his cold cousin. He asked the question gravely as if he were truly interested of someone else’s business.</p>
<p>“Do I look so strange to you?”</p>
<p>“You look very strange. You look like a stone.”</p>
<p>Richard chuckled at his harsh assessment, and Jilian’s expression grew stranger. For a moment, he wondered if he should lock him up until he came to his senses.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re going to be stuck here until this rain stops, so get your head out of your as!s,” Jilian said.</p>
<p>That was the sensible thing to do.</p>
<p>But Richard couldn’t help but wonder: what if her resolve had grown stronger in the meantime? What if her feelings for him had cooled down during their time apart?</p>
<p>What if she’d fallen back into her old life of vigor and optimism, surrounded by the affection of those who loved and cared for her? What if she grows to hate her relationship with him even more?</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but think about it. He wanted her before him, even if it didn’t solve anything immediately.</p>
<p>Richard, who was frantically engrossed in his thoughts and picked his nails like a bad child, suddenly realized he was in front of the Crown Prince and replied a beat too late.</p>
<p>“Yes. All right.”</p>
<p>“If you’re thinking of going back east to chase her down when the rain stops, you’d better stop.”</p>
<p>At his questioning look, Jilian clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“I know you,” he said. “You’ll be racking your brains to see what you can do to get back to the lady.”</p>
<p>Now Jilian realized Richard was a fool and a virg!n in love. He’d never had a real love affair, although he said he had when he was younger. Those were, at most, trivial relationships.  When he became an adult, there was nothing but work, war, and politics.</p>
<p>“Leave her alone for now. There’s no point in chasing after her now—it’ll only lead to a fight. Both you and Lady Liovanni need time. You’re bound to make foolish mistakes at the height of your emotions.”</p>
<p>In reality, it was advice born entirely from experience. Jilian clicked his tongue as he observed his cousin, who seemed likelier to stumble through trouble than he was.</p>
<p>Who would have known that such a cold-hearted individual would face such a trial? It was somewhat amusing, bitter, sour, and intriguing.</p>
<p>What would happen to this love affair? He didn’t know at this point.</p>
