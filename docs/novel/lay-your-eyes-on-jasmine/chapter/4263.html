            <h3><strong>Chapter 48.2</strong></h3>
<p>The color, resembling Richard’s eyes, made it even better. So, she was about to ask where he got such an item, but an unexpected answer came out.</p>
<p>“It’s my mother’s heirloom.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Surprised, Jasmine hesitated. <em>Can I have so important?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps sensing that she felt guilty and doubtful, Richard chuckled gently. His laughter felt close to her.</p>
<p>“Mother would say it suits you well if she saw you wearing it.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true. It’s luxurious.”</p>
<p>Richard chuckled at her raspy, farmgirl voice. The sound was pleasing to hear. Like a child, Jasmine pressed her cheek against his neck, savoring his warm voice and the blend of his scent with the cool fragrance of the forest. It was a sensation she wanted to immerse herself in, like a cozy dream on a midsummer night.</p>
<p>“My mother and aunt were inseparable friends. Even before my aunt became the empress, they often visited this estate as a family. I don’t remember well because I was so young, but…”</p>
<p>He spoke softly, retelling an old story.</p>
<p>“Because of that, traces of family members remain all over this estate. I had almost forgotten about this item, but the steward cleaning the warehouse last night brought it to me. He said mother used to wear this scarf often in her girlhood. I vaguely remember seeing her wearing it several times as a child.”</p>
<p>“It’s a very meaningful item.”</p>
<p>“It could be.”</p>
<p>Richard responded more casually than she expected. “But as soon as I saw it, I thought I wanted to give it to you.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I thought it would suit you well,” he said. “And it looks like my thoughts were not wrong.”</p>
<p>Jasmine cleared her throat as her cheeks warmed.</p>
<p>“But if it’s a family heirloom, shouldn’t it be given to your younger sister?”</p>
<p>“Risha isn’t interested in dressing up. And with her personality, she wouldn’t take care of it properly.”</p>
<p>Richard spoke of his sister as if he were talking about someone else. It was unfamiliar to Jasmine, who had a good relationship with her siblings. Still, in hindsight, it was probably just that their family was unusually close-knit. Their attitude as siblings was similar to Richard’s attitude toward his sister.</p>
<p>It was funny to think this perfect man could get along so well with his sister.</p>
<p>“Above all, I want to give it to you.”</p>
<p>Richard paused slightly. The nape of his neck was flushed.</p>
<p>“Because you are precious to me.”</p>
<p>For a moment, they stopped talking. They simply felt each other’s heartbeat through the quiet touch of their connected skin. It was a cozy and sweet moment where words were unnecessary.</p>
<p>That alone was enough. Until they reached the lodging, they shared a comforting silence. Jasmine whispered into his flushed ear, her face as pink as a peach.</p>
<p>“Thank you… I really love this scarf. It’s the best gift I’ve ever received.”</p>
<p>Whether he laughed in response or not, she couldn’t quite recall. Well, he probably did. Just like that boyish, sunny smile that made Jasmine gaze at him absentmindedly. How could such a grown man, usually as sharp as a knife, laugh so childishly?</p>
<p>It was sure to make people’s hearts flutter.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Miss?”</p>
<p>Jasmine snapped out of her reverie. I rubbed my cheek at her questioning gaze. Her head felt dizzy like she’d been forcibly awakened from a dream. Then, the dull, empty feeling of deprivation returned. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Nothing. It’s nothing at all.”</p>
<p>She muttered lowly.</p>
<p>“Wrap it up and leave it. It’s not mine.”</p>
<p>Jasmine struggled to turn her head away from the scarf. Her chest was burning again. She had to get out of here.</p>
<p>“Miss, how about departing after the day fully breaks? It’s still dark, and the road might be dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. But I’m in a hurry and want to get to the capital before noon. Don’t worry, I’ll pay you well.”</p>
<p>“Well, if that’s the case, I can’t help it. Understood.”</p>
<p>The coachman hesitated but eventually shrugged. Fortunately, it was summer, and the sun was rising early, so darkness was almost gone.</p>
<p>By the time the coachman had finished whipping the thirsty horses, it was already sunrise. When Jasmine had bundled up tightly against the chill dawn winds and set out on the road, the sky was already a mix of pink and gold.</p>
<p>The Lady Liovanni, eager to get out of here as soon as possible, paused momentarily to stare at the color of the sky. Her violet eyes seemed to be drawing something.</p>
<p><em>“Because I thought it would suit you well.”</em></p>
<p>His low laughter, the warmth from his broad back, and his wild heartbeat vividly came to her mind. She remembered the sunset summer forest sky over their heads.</p>
<p>It was a time so stunningly beautiful that it seemed to pass by in an instant.</p>
<p>Could I forget about this?</p>
<p>Once again, she couldn’t be sure.</p>
