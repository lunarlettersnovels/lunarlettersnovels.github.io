            <h3>Chapter 89.2</h3>
<p>Jasmine growled in a low, even tone, firing off her words quickly. Richard’s expression became ambiguous. She wasn’t entirely wrong, but for him, such minor incidents were hardly worth calling achievements.</p>
<p>If they had uncovered a large-scale drug operation, that would be different… Or could this possibly be the lead to something bigger?</p>
<p>Richard became lost in thought, struggling to decide between this and that. He sighed deeply.</p>
<p>“Alright. But you must follow my instructions exactly. Understood?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Despite her confident response, Richard sighed again, knowing that Jasmine’s quick wit and intuition had earned her the title of social queen in the cutthroat world of high society.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sir Salinger finished his conversation with the bartender and stood up to leave.</p>
<p>Richard, keeping his eyes lowered, leisurely sipped his drink as if nothing was amiss, waiting for Salinger to exit. Jasmine, though puzzled, admired how naturally Richard followed him out, almost fooling her despite being on the same side.</p>
<p>As they followed Salinger into the alley, Jasmine nearly bumped into Richard’s solid back when he suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>“Ouch, why did you stop?”</p>
<p>Richard sighed deeply again and glanced back at her.</p>
<p>“I’m still uneasy about this. Can’t we just leave?”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on. You’re worrying too much. With the Duke here, what’s the problem?”</p>
<p>asmine’s confidence stemmed from her belief in Richard Aion’s prowess, known as the Empire’s finest swordsman. However, Richard’s jaw tightened for some reason. When he remained silent for a while, Jasmine, feeling a bit awkward, called him softly.</p>
<p>“Richard?”</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>“……?”</p>
<p>His ears turned red as he rubbed his face. Richard bit his lip a few times before murmuring for her to follow carefully, briefly grasping her wrist before letting go. Feeling a sudden warmth in that spot, Jasmine rubbed her wrist absentmindedly.</p>
<p>A quiet pursuit ensued for a while. It seemed Sir Salinger hadn’t noticed they were following him. They trailed him as he left the alley, crossed a square, and took a carriage, eventually arriving near a residential area. They exchanged glances.</p>
<p>Is he just going home? If so, all this effort would be for nothing. Maybe Salinger was procuring the drugs for personal use…</p>
<p>But Richard had mentioned that Salinger showed none of the typical signs of drug addiction. He had also tested negative in the regular drug screenings conducted for military officers.</p>
<p>Then there are only three possible answers. First, he obtained the drugs for personal research purposes. Second, he is involved in the drug supply chain. Third, he acquired them for a third party or for unauthorized treatment.</p>
<p>And it seems…</p>
<p>“The first option makes the most sense, but it doesn’t seem to be the case.”</p>
<p>Jasmine narrowed her eyes, observing the scene, and then gasped. She had a hunch when she saw the carriage heading towards a familiar neighborhood, but seeing the silver-haired man meeting with Salinger confirmed her suspicions.</p>
<p>“Sir Soyer?”</p>
<p>“Shh. Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Richard calmed the shocked and stammering Jasmine, placing a finger to his lips and clicking his tongue.</p>
<p>Could it really be about drugs? To know for sure, they would need to identify the substance.</p>
<p>Salinger and Soyer exchanged a few words before the vial was handed over. They appeared more familiar with each other than before. Salinger even placed a hand on Soyer’s shoulder and gave him a light pat, whispering something in his ear.</p>
<p>Given Soyer’s usual aversion to physical contact with anyone other than his wife, this was highly unusual. Then again, this suspicious behavior was strange in itself.</p>
<p>After they left, a heavy silence settled between Richard and Jasmine. Having witnessed the scene, they exchanged complex glances.</p>
<p>“What do we do now?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Richard sighed softly. Running a hand through his hair, he clicked his tongue briefly. ‘I guess I’ll have to go to work tomorrow.’</p>
<p>“First, we need to investigate that bar. We should find out what kind of substances they are distributing.”</p>
<p>“And what about Sir Salinger?”</p>
<p>And Sir Soyer… Jasmine felt a pang of anxiety as Marianne’s face came to mind.</p>
<p>“If Count Atlante is arrested on charges of drug possession, what do you think will happen?”</p>
<p>“Well… it wouldn’t be good. Marianne is already in a bad state…”</p>
<p>“No, I’m asking how you would feel about it.”</p>
<p>Me? Jasmine blinked.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s nothing good about it for me. He’s annoying, but it wouldn’t sit well with me.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Richard nodded calmly.</p>
<p>“Even a non-custodial investigation related to drugs is a disgrace for a noble. In the military, where mental and physical health is directly tied to one’s abilities, it’s even more critical. Even if he’s found innocent, he might be passed over for promotions.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Richard glanced at her expression and continued.</p>
<p>“So, it would be better to resolve this personally if possible, before forming an investigative committee.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s enough for one night. Let’s head back.”</p>
<p>Jasmine stared at Richard’s outstretched hand for a moment before placing her hand in his, thinking.</p>
<p>Somehow, his words made it seem like… he was willing to take on the burden to ease her worries about her friend.</p>
