<p><strong>Chapter 50.1</strong></p>
<p>It hadn’t been more than a few hours, and even though they had fought like sworn enemies, he couldn’t believe he wanted to see her again.  He still wanted to see her despite feeling angry, resentful, remorseful, and heartbroken.</p>
<p><em>He missed her. Don’t you feel the same? Are you really okay? Don’t you have any lingering feelings? How can you be like this when you claimed to like me so much? For that long time…</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, the face of Jasmine, who looked exhausted, came to mind.</p>
<p>His heart sank in a different way. Her hardships were a source of bitter frustration, embarrassment, discomfort, and anxiety. He felt like had been reduced to something worthless, tiresome, and insignificant.</p>
<p>It was a humiliation he had never experienced before.</p>
<p><em>‘Are you sick of me? Are you sick of me?</em>’ Jasmine actually said so. “I’m sick of you.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t express his anger at that time because of the sudden blow to his chest. His mouth was tight-lipped as the sensation of being thrown away washed over him.</p>
<p>Richard couldn’t get his head around these terrible extremes. His world was overturned when she provided him with such sweetness and abundance—that became a source of intense pain, hatred, and agony in a single moment.</p>
<p>His brain froze at this capricious twist. It was so burdensome to follow it that he couldn’t even develop an appropriate and wise response. If he hadn’t acted so foolishly if he had resolved the misunderstanding more effectively, if he had…</p>
<p><em>Would she still be in my arms? Would I hold her and fall into a sweet, full sleep as usual?</em></p>
<p>A hollow laughter escaped him at his absurd fantasies. Richard pressed his heavy eyelids with his cold, numb hands. He wandered all night to cool his head that he didn’t even realize dawn had come. He lost track of time to calm down the intense emotions.</p>
<p>He strode into the mansion, rubbing his cool, rough cheeks. The corridor was already quietly bustling, with employees starting their day. They fell silent and stepped aside like parting waves as the pale-faced Duke walked through.</p>
<p>“Ah, Duke! You’re up early.”</p>
<p>“Your Excellency…?”</p>
<p>A few aristocrats encountered the duke, but their morning greetings were ignored without meaning.</p>
<p>Richard swiftly moved through the crowd like a lion diving into a herd of gazelles. He headed straight to Jasmine’s location but suddenly turned around. He went to his room first, tidied up, changed his clothes, and then positioned himself for Jasmine’s visit.</p>
<p>He didn’t look like a horse, so he wanted to make a good impression for such an important meeting. Jasmine usually liked my face, but even though he looked like a well-groomed gentleman, he hesitated before knocking on the door.</p>
<p>It felt kind of absurd, considering that just yesterday, he walked right into her room, held her in his arms, and fu!cked her to his heart’s content. Here he was, waiting outside without her permission.</p>
<p>He chuckled and rubbed his tired eyes before walking up and down the hallway. He thought it had been a long time, but it was too early. He hadn’t slept at all, so he had no sense of time.</p>
<p>Jasmine typically enjoyed a leisurely breakfast, took a short walk, and then indulged in tea time. That is unless he interrupted her in the middle. Knowing all too well how defenseless and adorable she was when freshly awake, he couldn’t help but chuckle at the instinctive reaction that ran through his body. Damn it.</p>
<p>“Your Grace?”</p>
<p>Richard whirled around to see an older maid backing away, flinching. Not Jasmine’s maid. His brow furrowed, and she spoke cautiously when he tilted his head.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here, by any chance….”</p>
<p>“I’m here to see Princess Jasmine Giovanni. Is she awake?”</p>
<p>The maid seemed surprised to be asked the question first, but she answered politely. “She left at dawn.”</p>
<p>Richard stood dumbfounded, speechless for a moment.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>“We were surprised when she packed up her things and left quickly…”</p>
<p>“Why? Where? How long has she been gone?”</p>
<p>Richard appeared calm on the surface, but his dilated pupils, bloodied fists, and tense jaw suggested a hidden turmoil, like a snarling beast ready to burst at the tip of a needle.</p>
<p>“That’s well… she said she was heading back to the capital, but she’s only been out for a short time…”</p>
<p>The words had barely left her mouth when his long coat began to flutter, and he swiftly passed the maid. Gritting his teeth, Richard started walking quickly, then broke into a run.</p>
