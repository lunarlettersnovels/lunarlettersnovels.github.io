            <h3><strong>Chapter 42.2</strong></h3>
<p>Jasmine mumbled without denying it. In reality, she was just as excited, and her unde!rwear was slightly damp.</p>
<p>Perhaps when he grazed her lower half while kissing earlier, he might have noticed. However, she swallowed her saliva, gathered her legs, and stood against the wall.  Richard smiled as he observed her movements closely.</p>
<p>“Do you see me as someone who would ravish a person who says no like a beast?”</p>
<p>It was a somewhat cynical jest. Looking at his cool face with a faint smile, Jasmine quietly shook her head.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>As if encouraging her to speak more, he gently brushed her hair slowly. Jasmine chose her words carefully. But she couldn’t think of anything specific, so she just shrugged.</p>
<p>“Where’s the gentleman Richard? I was surprised, that’s all.”</p>
<p>Richard, who had been quietly listening to her, caressed her warm, flushed cheek. Jasmine quietly received his touch.</p>
<p>It was familiar, and she enjoyed it when he passionately pursued her, but she especially liked it when he treated her gently, showing affection with small gestures.</p>
<p>It felt good, not just because of the mood but also because it was comfortable and cozy. She felt protected and respected. As if reading her wishes, Richard continued to caress and embrace her.</p>
<p>When he lowered his head again to kiss her on the forehead, Jasmine did not resist but accepted it. His lips, buried in her golden hair, subtly curved.</p>
<p>“‘Sir Richard.'”</p>
<p>It was a very soft voice, and Jasmine’s eyebrows raised in confusion. Richard briefly shook his head.</p>
<p>“No. I must have bothered a sick person. Let’s go inside.”</p>
<p>He stepped back, letting her go. Jasmine looked up at his neatly arranged face, contemplating how to reply. However, she couldn’t think of any specific words. Although they used to carry on endless conversations without a hitch when alone, it now felt as dry as a drought in their mouths.</p>
<p>It had only been half a day. Jasmine sighed lightly. It felt awkward even to her. What was this lingering regret that surfaced once things got a bit awkward?</p>
<p>“Uh….”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>They both opened their mouths simultaneously, then shut them as their eyes met. They stood apart, gazing at each other from a distance. However, neither showed signs of leaving first. Jasmine, glancing at his hidden fist behind his back, mumbled.</p>
<p>“I, what?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. What were you going to say?”</p>
<p>His retort was as smooth as it was swift. Jasmine lightly tapped the floor with her heel and spoke softly.</p>
<p>“No, nothing. Just wanted to wish you a good night. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Richard’s lips closed neatly.</p>
<p>“Yes. You too, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>But neither turned away first. Jasmine wasn’t used to this situation.</p>
<p>They were together all week, so instead of telling each other good night, they were busy kissing, and whispering sweet nothing. One person drags the the other by their hand towards the bedroom, where they embraced and mixed their warmth as soon as their eyes met. Because hiis embrace, her scent – it was just too delightful.</p>
<p>In the strange silence, as they stood awkwardly, they were probably both pondering the same things. Something subtle crept over their expressions.</p>
<p>“Hah.”</p>
<p>Richard exhaled a long breath after rinsing his face. Jasmine, who had involuntarily focused on his long and elegant hands, suddenly remembered the coldness of his hands when she touched them earlier.</p>
<p>His hands, waiting for her to warm them up.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, during this unfamiliar silence, courage surged forth. Usually, considering their status, it would have been better for each to take some time alone overnight and discuss things with a clearer mind the next day after a light hug and a brief kiss.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t wait. She didn’t want to let things go like this. She couldn’t bear the thought of organizing this suffocating and frightening matter later and returning to how things were before.</p>
<p><em>‘What if there was a misunderstanding? Maybe talking could resolve things. After all, he had been waiting for me. Wven if he doesn’t feel as strongly as I do… He still likes me, right?’</em></p>
<p>Breaking the standoff, Jasmine extended her hand first.</p>
<p>“Richard, want to go for a walk?”</p>
<p>Entering a closed room to drink together only spells trouble, as it might rekindle the tension. However, a walk wouldn’t hurt. After all, there would be another tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Richard gazed silently at the small hand she offered. As if observing something unfamiliar or perhaps being cautious, there was no immediate reaction, like a startled predator facing unexpected prey. Just as Jasmine was about to withdraw her hand, Richard moved closer and gently pinched her fingertips.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>His large hand felt warm.</p>
