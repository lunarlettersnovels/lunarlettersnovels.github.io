            <h3>Chapter 97.2</h3>
<p>Pride, the caution of not wanting to get hurt, those things just become cumbersome and useless over time. When you actually face it, more than half of the things you worried about don’t even exist. So, just calculate whether this choice might really ruin you or make you feel like you could die. Just up to that point. Beyond that, as long as the pain is something you can endure, it’s worth facing a few times. Truly valuable things leave scars that remain like badges of honor.”</p>
<p>As if in rhythm with her slowly blinking eyelashes, a warm hand touched her head. The gentle patting and lullaby-like advice made her feel so at ease that she could almost fall asleep.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Everything will pass. Somehow, everything will pass. It will get better.”</p>
<p>Strangely, listening to her firm voice gave Jasmine an odd confidence and assurance that everything would indeed be okay, as if it would all magically resolve. Yes, everything will be alright. All of it.</p>
<p>“Want to go shopping? Let’s relieve some stress.”</p>
<p>“You don’t like shopping.”</p>
<p>“I like spending other people’s money. It’s all your money anyway.</p>
<p>“Wow, shameless.”</p>
<p>Jasmine giggled, and seeing her mood improve, Marian sighed in relief.</p>
<p>Jasmine spent some time cuddling and playfully rubbing her cheek against Marian’s, who ruffled her hair like a puppy. After Marian took care of her son Joshua and finished organizing at home, they agreed to meet a few hours later and went out.</p>
<p>Before the meeting time, Jasmine wanted to take a leisurely walk by herself. She had heard that Aisha’s exhibition was being held at a nearby art gallery. There are times when everything aligns perfectly by chance.</p>
<p>Jasmine hadn’t felt that relaxed in a long time, and she happily bought a ticket. Dressed in velvet gloves, a small hat, a white parasol, a jacket with pea buttons, and a bustle dress that puffed out her hip line, she looked like a girl straight out of a romantic painting.</p>
<p>She walked inside the showroom, thinking about her newly ordered lace parasol.</p>
<p>The grand art gallery, used as a venue for cultural exchange since the founding festival, was supported by massive columns in the late imperial style and paved with bluish-gray and reddish-brown marble.</p>
<p>Groups of people spoke in hushed tones as they gathered to appreciate the artworks, while some citizens enjoyed their own leisurely time alone.</p>
<p>Jasmine started from the less crowded areas, slowly taking in the paintings.</p>
<p>As expected of Aisha, her skills seemed to have improved significantly over time.</p>
<p>Feeling a sense of pride, Jasmine admired a painting that vividly captured a scene from the capital: noble men and women conversing at an outdoor café, gentry reading newspapers and smoking cigars, and an unknown poet sitting in a corner, head in hand, writing poetry.</p>
<p>Aisha was a master of portraiture and loved observing and capturing people on canvas, but she actually preferred painting the natural, everyday scenes of people on the streets.</p>
<p>She only started painting portraits for financial reasons.</p>
<p>Despite that, her natural aptitude and skill led to great success. Now that she had established her reputation, Aisha began painting what she truly wanted.</p>
<p>Scenes from social parties, citizens spending time in the capital’s afternoon square on weekends, ladies hosting tea parties, men and women boating, a chef smoking a cigarette during a break, dancers preparing for a performance, and the playful tussles between maids and young ladies.</p>
<p>The colorful landscapes seen through her eyes were vibrant and beautiful. As a female artist, she captured the often-overlooked details of everyday life in her artwork. Jasmine found these warm, romantic paintings very appealing.</p>
<p>“Hmm, maybe I’ll buy this one.”</p>
<p>She stopped in front of a painting of a boy with red fur earmuffs, blowing on his hands to warm them.</p>
<p>The boy sitting on the steps in front of the red brick house’s front door, gazing into the distance, seemed to be either waiting for someone or simply taking a break from playing, with a faint blush on his cheeks.</p>
<p>His sparkling, grape-like eyes and raven-black hair, the small hands with red-tipped fingers, and the white snow piled on the steps all caught Jasmine’s attention. She thought, ‘I’m somewhat strangely drawn to it.’ She liked the way it warmed her heart despite the winter setting.</p>
<p>After a moment of contemplation, she called for the curator and said she wanted to purchase the painting. She also left a short message for Aisha. After some thought, she scribbled just one word.</p>
<p>“Superb!”</p>
<p>Thinking of her friend’s likely triumphant reaction made her smile. Everything was pleasant as she left, except for nearly bumping into someone. She stumbled but quickly regained her balance with the help of the person who steadied her.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry… Oh?”</p>
<p>“Charles?”</p>
<p>It was Charles, the young Marquis and Jasmine’s first date, whom she hadn’t seen in a long time. Seeing Jasmine’s surprised and somewhat pleased expression, Charles was initially startled, then flustered, and finally smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“Hello, Lady Liovanni. How have you been?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been well. It’s been a while. Are you here to see the paintings?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I happened to get a ticket.”</p>
<p>Charles scratched his head awkwardly as he smiled. After that, they were at a loss for words.</p>
<p>As he was about to turn away, saying goodbye, he paused and looked back at her. In his face, Jasmine felt a sense of déjà vu, as if seeing him for the last time when they had parted ways amicably.</p>
<p>“Um, Jasmine. Would you like to have a cup of tea?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
