            <h3>Chapter 88.2</h3>
<p>Richard clicked his tongue. This is why fathers and brothers are so vigilant when a man approaches their daughter or sister. They know, being men themselves, how much of a vile beast lies within.</p>
<p>Unaware of this, the young lady on his back seemed to have found peace, her legs swinging under his arms. Sometimes, Jasmine’s small actions revealed her inner child. It was both endearing and worrisome, her unchanged vulnerability made him sigh.</p>
<p>Even now, it’s the same. What makes her trust him so completely with her body? She knows full well how beastly Richard Aion can become.</p>
<p>Does she really think that just because he acts like a gentleman and lowers himself, he is entirely clean and courteous inside? Even while drawing boundaries, she subconsciously trusted him.</p>
<p>This was evident in Jasmine’s unguarded, unconscious small actions. At least, compared to the gestures and expressions she had shown to the Marquis’s eldest son before, the difference was clear.</p>
<p>Realizing this, he felt both worried for her and satisfied.</p>
<p>He was grateful for Jasmine’s unchanged innocence and kindness, and the trust she had built in him over time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the man she knew was both the same and entirely different from who he was now.</p>
<p>“But, you know…”</p>
<p>Richard calmed the beast within him and answered her call composedly.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Do you know where my house is?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>Of course, it was a secret that he had once wandered around her house drunk and only returned home at dawn. Jasmine, who had no idea, lightly thought that he must have passed by sometime since they were both from noble families. Then she asked something that had been on her mind for a while.</p>
<p>“You know…”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I have something to ask you, and I want you to answer honestly.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>Jasmine hesitated for a long time before timidly asking her question.</p>
<p>“Did I really gain weight?”</p>
<p>“Puhaha!”</p>
<p>Richard couldn’t hold back his laughter.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The event that allowed their ambiguously subdued relationship to continue happened by chance.</p>
<p>They still had about twenty minutes to walk to the Grand Duke’s residence, and Jasmine felt guilty about being carried by him the whole way, so she suggested they take a carriage. But Richard stubbornly insisted.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to personally escort her as an apology for any inconvenience he had caused. Jasmine could have cut him off more coldly if she wanted to, but for some reason, she didn’t feel like it and eventually agreed.</p>
<p>‘Ha, so much for cutting ties. I really am too soft-hearted.’</p>
<p>Resting her chin on his steadily moving back, Jasmine thought, ‘Why is it so hard to be cold to you? I’ve done my best, but maybe it’s because you keep pushing towards me.’</p>
<p>Feeling a bit melancholic, she watched the streetlights turning on one by one. Suddenly, she straightened up with a sound of surprise. Seeing her staring intently at something, Richard asked what was wrong.</p>
<p>“Jasmine?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that person over there?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Ah, Sir Salinger! The head of the military medical unit we saw last time!”</p>
<p>Jasmine urgently shouted and patted Richard’s back, asking to be let down. Among the busy citizens heading home, a tall military doctor was walking.</p>
<p>Because he was a knight before being a doctor, his distinguished military demeanor stood out even from a distance among the ordinary people.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Jasmine had a strong premonition. Whether it was intuition or a woman’s instinct, it was almost never wrong. Even when making important or large investments, if she had such a flash of intuition, it always turned out to be a big success.</p>
<p>Sir Salinger leisurely entered an alley. Jasmine, almost jumping down, chased after him, and Richard, frowning, followed her. He quickly caught up with Jasmine and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>“Why are you following him?”</p>
<p>“Just wait.”</p>
<p>As Jasmine shushed him and hurried ahead, Richard had no choice but to follow.</p>
<p>Sir Salinger, moving swiftly, was disappearing down the winding alleyways. After a bit of back-and-forth, they saw him enter a secluded tavern. Quite an unusual choice for the nation’s top military doctor.</p>
<p>Jasmine tilted her head and observed Richard’s expression. He, too, seemed surprised, his eyes reflecting a curious look.</p>
<p>“Are you going in there?”</p>
<p>“Of course. We’ve come this far.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Though he didn’t seem particularly eager, Richard had anticipated this. He quickly pulled out a hooded cloak he had hastily purchased from a nearby stall and draped it over Jasmine. As she widened her eyes in surprise, Richard covered his own face with his cloak and said,</p>
<p>“There’s no benefit in showing our faces.”</p>
<p>This way. Deciding it was best to get it over with quickly, he took the lead this time. Jasmine, inwardly impressed by his sense and thoroughness, followed him, staring at his reliable back with newfound admiration.</p>
<p>The place was a dark tavern. As soon as they entered, the strong smell of incense hit them, causing them to cover their mouths and noses. In the dimly lit corners, people were talking, drinking, and smoking pipes.</p>
