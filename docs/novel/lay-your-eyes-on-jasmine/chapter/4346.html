            <p><strong>Chapter 6.2</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine gently held her friend’s chin, turning her head towards Caras as she whispered.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. I wanted to have some fun on my own anyway.  Take care of my brother, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, yeah? Hey, but…”</p>
<p>With a playful peck on Nicky’s cheek, Jasmine chuckled and slipped into the crowd like a little bird. Though her love might be unrequited, she hoped the people she cared about would have good fortune.</p>
<p>She couldn’t ask for anyone better for her brother than Nicky.</p>
<p>After that, Jasmine continued to enjoy herself on her own. She sipped punch, listened to the songs of her favorite opera prima donna, watched a play specially arranged by the Countess, and continued to indulge in drinking.</p>
<p>Her mood was soaring, and the night was quite fantastic.</p>
<p>And she ended up getting slightly tipsy.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, ma’am. If you’re alone…”</p>
<p>“Oh no, it’s okay.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, a few men approached her. Although Jasmine wore a mask, her distinctive, lively demeanor and spirited gestures were not concealed, from the swaying gait to her charming forehead, straight nose, full lips, and graceful neck.</p>
<p>Jasmine adeptly fended off the suitors. Such situations were not new to her, having encountered them at social events before. Even if the intention today was to engage with men, well… who knows.</p>
<p>She disliked men. They were bothersome. Were they always this way?</p>
<p>Their advances didn’t pique her interest, so she felt no inclination.</p>
<p>With a flushed face, she laughed heartily, raising her new glass of wine.</p>
<p>“I’m definitely getting tipsy.”</p>
<p>Feeling unburdened, she reveled in the freedom that came with letting loose. Suppressing oneself had never been so liberating. She thought, “This is how I should live from now on! Why did I live so uptight?”</p>
<p>Her vision had started to blur a little now. After stifling a yawn and stumbling to her feet, she realized it was probably time to head inside. Despite being a rather tame gathering for young folks, Jasmine found satisfaction in the evening’s simplicity. She hummed to herself as she waded through the crowd, when suddenly, someone blocked her path. Annoyed, she turned around with a swift motion.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Greetings, madam.”</p>
<p>The man wearing a bat mask was tall. His elegant bow and eyes that shimmered beneath the mask caught Jasmine’s gaze, causing her brows to furrow. Not another suitor.</p>
<p>“I’ve been observing you for a while now. Perhaps…”</p>
<p>“I’m not feeling well.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a lie. Her vision had slightly split into two. As she pressed her fingers against her forehead, trying to regain her focus, the man once again blocked her path. Seriously?</p>
<p>“Haha. That’s what I thought.”</p>
<p>She felt the strength of the hand gripping her wrist and put on a stern expression.</p>
<p>“Seeing as you don’t appear well, may I offer you an escort?”</p>
<p>His words were polite, but his actions didn’t sit well with her. She responded with a colder tone.</p>
<p>“I don’t wish to be asked such a favor from a gentleman who raised his hand without permission.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see. I was concerned as you seemed unsteady. I apologize.”</p>
<p>He let go of her wrist, but a lingering discomfort lingered.</p>
<p>She felt irritated. Objectively speaking, he hadn’t committed any major rudeness, yet the feeling of discomfort remained. It was unnecessary annoyance, almost as if she was being overly sensitive. However, in most cases, it was simply due to the lack of respect from the other person.</p>
<p>Her mother, the Duchess, had taught her this from a young age. Even if a person of the opposite gender didn’t respect her, she should firmly decline, even if they were tempting.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but…”</p>
<p>Jasmine was in a bad mood. It felt like everyone in the world was ignoring her, especially the males.</p>
<p>“I’ve never asked anyone to worry about me.”</p>
<p>Despite her slightly dizzy state, she replied coldly, and her interlocutor seemed surprised by her response. In the midst of his bewilderment, Jasmine brushed past him and continued walking forward.</p>
<p>She was regaining her composure. Should she head home and have some dessert? Hug her teddy bear and sing a song? Maybe play chess with James. Gradually, she managed to maintain</p>
<p>her demeanor, even as her surroundings seemed to blur into the universe. At least, that’s how Jasmine saw it.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, ma’am!”</p>
<p>Just as she thought the man was following her, she turned around irritably. But as she did, a sudden shadow loomed between them. What? She looked at the wide figure with round, violet eyes.</p>
<p>“This lady has a prior engagement with me.”</p>
<p>The voice was smooth, like a low note on a piano.</p>
<p>As soon as she recognized the familiar tone, shivers ran down her spine. In an instant, he effortlessly dismissed the man with his imposing presence. The knight, even from a distance, was a robust, dominant individual—a person of strength.</p>
<p>Even though he wore a mask.</p>
<p>Slowly turning around and meeting Jasmine’s gaze, Richard’s heart felt a thud as if it had dropped. She couldn’t say anything due to the sudden tension, but Richard spoke first.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Th-thank you.”</p>
<p>Unknowingly stumbling over her words, Jasmine felt her pride wounded. Why did she always end up like this in front of him?</p>
<p>Why was she acting so helpless and unable to detach herself from a rather insignificant person?</p>
<p>Jasmine thought he was neither elegant nor handsome enough to warrant acting so submissively.</p>
<p>Her ears turned slightly pink. She knew it was unnecessary pride, yet still. Nevertheless, this is how she felt.</p>
