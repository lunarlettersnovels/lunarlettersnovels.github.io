            <p><strong>Chapter 56.2</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine closed her eyes carefully and sniffed the sweet fragrance wafting through the air. While savoring the scent, Nicky tapped the floor impatiently with her arms folded.</p>
<p>And as soon as Jasmine opened her eyes, Nicky eagerly asked, “How is it, how is it? Is it good?”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Jasmine tilted her head and replied, “It’s good but slightly disappointing compared to last time.”</p>
<p>“Why! “The last time I tried it out, they said it was okay!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s okay. But the top note is slightly sultry, so people might have different opinions.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, well, maybe that’s true.”</p>
<p>Nicky narrowed her eyebrows as if she were pondering the same thing. While lost in thought, Jasmine picked up a cup of tea and took a sip. It was jasmine tea. Nicky apologized.</p>
<p>“Oh, you mentioned you didn’t like this scent. Sorry. I forgot.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t necessarily dislike it.”</p>
<p>She trailed off, swirling the tea around her tongue, savoring the faint scent reminiscent of her name, and then swallowed it as if it were poison. The aftertaste was extremely bitter.</p>
<p>In a state of contemplation, Jasmine rummaged through her snacks and selected the sweetest biscuit, popping it into her mouth and chewing. Its fragrant aroma somehow brought a sense of calm.</p>
<p>“Adding a slightly fruity scent could make it sweeter,” Jasmine commented.</p>
<p>“I tried that too. Ah, I have a feeling about what to do.”</p>
<p>As if inspired during their conversation, Nicky nodded and jotted something down in her notebook.</p>
<p>This was Nicky’s workshop, a perfumer’s haven where she had experimented with scents since childhood. It was a cozy workshop littered with sticky notes, glass bottles containing various perfumes, and perfume-making equipment.</p>
<p>That one must be a machine that costs over 2 million won. Following Jasmine’s gaze, Nicky shrugged.</p>
<p>“Thanks to your investment, I bought a new one. Isn’t it pretty?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what I’m looking at, but it looks cool.”</p>
<p>Jasmine scratched her head. Although she studied economics and business management deeply, she had no direct business experience. Perhaps because she was lucky or had intuition and insight, the businesses she had invested in from a young age were often successful.</p>
<p>So, she had a talent for making money rather than running a business directly. The Duke and Duchess were pleased with their youngest daughter’s unexpected talent and had set aside a portion of her inheritance for her to manage separately.</p>
<p>“It’s your property, so manage it yourself,” they said.</p>
<p>So Jasmine could live relatively comfortably and well without her parents’ support. She didn’t have a separate residence since she had no intention of becoming independent from them yet.</p>
<p>She was considering buying a mansion to live on her own, but all her brothers were against it, so her plans were thwarted. If she thought about it, she would still feel empty if separated from her family.</p>
<p>“By the way, are things going well with you and my brother? That Karas—he’s so tight-lipped that it takes some charm to get him talking.”</p>
<p>“Hohoho. That’s the charm of our Lord Karas. Just how reserved can he be?”</p>
<p>“Oh my, you guys are a couple now.”</p>
<p>Jasmine grumbled as if she was upset, but seeing that they seemed to be doing well was good. Nicky, who had been watching her with a sidelong glance, suddenly piped up.</p>
<p>“What about you? Are you getting along well with that young lord?”</p>
<p>“Oh, well.”</p>
<p>Jasmine murmured casually. Her eyes were as dry as if she were chewing paper when discussing her relationship with him.</p>
<p>“Just okay? Not bad.”</p>
<p>In fact, Jasmine was already sick of it and thinking about breaking up. The first few days were enjoyable, but for some reason, as time went on, it felt increasingly cumbersome and tiring. It was clear she didn’t like him.</p>
<p>Nicky, who somewhat grasped the unsaid words Jasmine left out, rolled her eyes and clicked her tongue.</p>
<p>“Are you going to drive men crazy like that? Be reasonable. Do it in moderation.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Do you know what your nickname is? Seven-Day Lily.”</p>
<p>“What kind of nonsense is that?”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s mouth hung open in disbelief. Nicky, who was chuckling, said seriously to her laughing friend.</p>
<p>“Lilies only bloom for seven days. Just like you. You met sweetly, but suddenly, the relationship cooled off, and you decided to break up after less than a week.”</p>
<p>“Pfft! That’s not a plot for a romantic play, let alone Seven-Day Lily.”</p>
<p>“It’s true. It’s not that surprising, honestly. You break up after exactly one week of dating. None of them lasted longer than a week. Is there any reason for that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I haven’t really thought about it.”</p>
<p>As Jasmine shrugged, Nicky shook her head in exasperation.</p>
<p>All of Jasmine’s friends were surprised by this change. Originally, she was a girl obsessed with men, but these days, Jasmine, the flower of society, is a thing of the past, and now she is no different from the queen bee of society.</p>
