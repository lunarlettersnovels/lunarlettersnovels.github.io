            <h3>Chapter 91.2</h3>
<p>“Isn’t it dangerous? Why on earth would someone take such a thing…?”</p>
<p>Thinking of Marian, who had gone to her parents’ house to see her son, Jasmine felt deeply pained and worried. Even if it wasn’t an affair, if he was truly an addict, she wondered if it might be better to divorce him. Richard, intending to comfort her, added.</p>
<p>“Still, this drug is among the least addictive and has the fewest side effects of the substances that shop handled. If he hasn’t been taking it for a long time, the addiction risk should be minimal.”</p>
<p>“If there’s no problem, then why take it secretly!”</p>
<p>“That’s a good question.”</p>
<p>Richard rubbed his chin thoughtfully for a moment.</p>
<p>“When your friend said her husband was acting strange, did she mention any issues with overspending or financial problems?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, she said it wasn’t excessive. He’s always been frugal, so even if he spent more, it was about average?”</p>
<p>One of the changes that raised suspicions of an affair was suddenly using hidden funds, and although it wasn’t much, she had heard that his spending had increased compared to usual. Listening quietly, Richard sighed.</p>
<p>“One of the common paths nobles with drug problems often fall into is gambling. They can’t control their impulses and seek strong stimulation.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s mouth fell open in despair. This was getting worse and worse. What should she do, Marian? Unable to hold back, she slammed the table.</p>
<p>“Is he crazy! Bring him in immediately and interrogate him! Beat him until he confesses or get him to sign the divorce papers!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Jasmine. These are all just hypotheses.”</p>
<p>“Hypotheses, my foot! I saw it all with my own eyes yesterday!”</p>
<p>Jasmine shouted like an enraged cat. This white-haired jerk must have really lost it! She looked ready to storm out and grab him by the collar, so Richard tried to calm her down, hushing her.</p>
<p>“We don’t have any evidence yet. We need to find out the exact facts to help your friend.”</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa. Wow, they say you can’t trust anyone. What if, what if he’s doing drugs and having an affair? How do we know! They could be doing both together!”</p>
<p>“It’s not impossible, but…”</p>
<p>Richard, who was always almost excessively honest, quickly corrected himself after seeing Jasmine’s expression.</p>
<p>“Unlikely. It’s too early to jump to conclusions.”</p>
<p>“Wow, really. Wow. To do that to his wife and child. If he’s been taking drugs and doing reckless things, then…”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s fingers twitched as she ground her teeth. Seeing her hands move as if ready to tear out every strand of his fine hair, Richard instinctively felt a chill run down his spine.</p>
<p>Wondering why he felt this way, he rubbed the back of his head. Though he didn’t think there was much hope, he offered some comforting words to provide a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>“Maybe he was taking it temporarily for treatment.”</p>
<p>“Treatment? What treatment! You said there was nothing in his medical records! And if it was just a simple illness, why hide it? With so many good medications available, why would he resort to something like that!”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>In the end, he agreed. Richard narrowed his eyes in thought for a moment before speaking. In truth, he had come to see Jasmine from the morning to say this.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I would like you to stop worrying about this matter. This issue goes beyond the personal realm and is something that someone like me should handle entirely.”</p>
<p>It was a polite but quite official and boundary-setting statement.</p>
<p>In the past, Jasmine might have felt she was troubling him, become apologetic, and withdrawn, saying she understood. But she was no longer in that ‘very personal state’ overwhelmed by emotions.</p>
<p>She looked at Richard quietly and asked.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that out of concern for me?”</p>
<p>“It’s against investigative principles, and it’s an illegal matter. It’s not a normal situation for a civilian…”</p>
<p>Seeing him trail off, Jasmine felt a pang in her heart. He was concerned about her in his own way. Coming to see her so early in the morning was proof of that. She felt both grateful and sorry. Jasmine spoke soothingly.</p>
<p>“You said you rounded them all up, right? Then we just need to interrogate that damned Soyer, don’t we?”</p>
<p>“Technically, only the military doctor Salinger and Soyer, who is affiliated with the military, remain.”</p>
<p>“Right. But even so, there shouldn’t be any practical issues, should there?”</p>
<p>It’s not like I’m planning to conduct an espionage operation with you like yesterday.</p>
<p>“I think I can request to be kept informed about the case processing since I was involved in the information-gathering process. So, tell me what you plan to do next.”</p>
<p>“Haa… Nobles like Soyer require a more cautious and detailed investigation, so I plan to conduct a preliminary investigation first.”</p>
