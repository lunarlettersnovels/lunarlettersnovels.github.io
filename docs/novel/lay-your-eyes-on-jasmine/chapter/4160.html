            <h3>Chapter 100.2</h3>
<p>Jasmine felt herself wavering helplessly and pressed her forehead with her hand. The person in front of her was overwhelming. More precisely, it was her own longing for him, still searching and yearning, that was difficult to bear. She felt a twinge of frustration, almost like anger. Frowning, she asked,</p>
<p>“Why are you going this far for me?”</p>
<p>Richard responded with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Then what about you?”</p>
<p>Do you have a reason for going this far for me?</p>
<p>Is it a foolish question with an obvious answer? After all, is there really a reason for why someone likes another person?</p>
<p>Richard, with a pained expression, pleaded intensely.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, are you sure you won’t regret it? I can’t say the same. Be honest. Can you really forget me and live well? Do you remember how we were, how tender and fulfilling it was? Have you ever imagined what it would be like now if that night hadn’t happened, if we had understood each other a bit more? If I lose you now, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>In the end, Jasmine gave in completely.</p>
<p>If she couldn’t fully cut him off or accept him, why not just let things flow naturally? Avoiding her lingering feelings for him was, in the end, her own stubbornness. After all, if it fell apart multiple times before, so why not let it break once more?</p>
<p>Since it has already shattered once, maybe it would hurt less the next time.</p>
<p>“Haa. Alright. Let’s give it a try.”</p>
<p>Richard’s head snapped up.</p>
<p>Jasmine shook her head.</p>
<p>“It’s not exactly ‘let’s start over.’ It’s more like… Richard, you asked me to trust you once. Honestly, I’m still not sure. But it’s true that I have lingering feelings, and what you said makes sense.”</p>
<p>Slowly, without rushing. That much might be okay.</p>
<p>Understanding her intention, Richard nodded. He nodded again. Even that much was something, for now.</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p>“I’m not asking you to do your best.”</p>
<p>“I know. Still.”</p>
<p>Why is he smiling like that? Jasmine fidgeted with her fingers, feeling restless and unsure. Yet, there was a sense of relief, as if she had finally let go of something she had been tensely holding onto for so long, bringing a slight comfort to a corner of her heart.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I’ll take you home.”</p>
<p>In the end, her plans with Marian were postponed.</p>
<p>Richard made the offer to Jasmine, who had just received a message that Joshua wouldn’t be able to come due to a sudden upset stomach. Looking up at him as he waited with his hand extended, she recalled how pleased she had been earlier when her schedule had seemed to align perfectly for the day.</p>
<p>Was this a coincidence too? As he said, it was a day full of coincidences.</p>
<p>When Jasmine placed her hand in his, he supported it with familiarity and briefly kissed the back of her hand. Even through the glove, the sensation sent a tingle up to her neck. Meeting her slightly surprised eyes, Richard rubbed his thumb over her hand and smiled warmly.</p>
<p>His striking blue eyes curved into crescents beneath his naturally tousled black hair, and a dimple appeared on one cheek, catching her attention. Oh dear, such a charmer.</p>
<p>Jasmine blurted out without thinking.</p>
<p>“You seem like a flirt.”</p>
<p>Richard froze like a statue, seemingly taken aback.</p>
<p>“Why suddenly… where did that come from?”</p>
<p>“Do you usually do this kind of thing so casually, anytime?”</p>
<p>Trying to dispel her embarrassment, Jasmine spoke with a deliberately stern tone, and the earnest Richard took her words at face value, furrowing his brow in confusion. His repeated blinking seemed genuinely aggrieved.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that. I haven’t really done this kind of greeting unless necessary.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you do it?”</p>
<p>“Just, just… because I wanted to. Is that not allowed?”</p>
<p>It’s a greeting even mentioned in etiquette books. Richard narrowed his eyebrows as he defended himself. He was flustered, yet there was a hint of disappointment. It must have been bewildering to be suddenly accused.</p>
<p>Jasmine didn’t quite understand why she was being so childish, but his charming smile seemed momentarily annoying. Then again, it wasn’t surprising that someone could attract others with just a simple, unintentional smile</p>
<p>“It just seems like this kind of thing is second nature to you. You really do like physical contact.”</p>
<p>“I don’t do this elsewhere. Only with you. Do you dislike it?”</p>
<p>Richard looked genuinely aggrieved, his expression deeply furrowed. With lingering frustration, he continued.</p>
<p>“Do I really come across that way? I’ve never cheated on a partner or tarnished my honor in my life. I have no intention of doing so. Why would I do such a thing when I have my own woman?”</p>
<p>His words spilled out rapidly, clearly upset. She hadn’t truly thought he would do such things, but it seemed his feelings were quite hurt.</p>
<p>Jasmine had only meant to tease him a little, but now she felt sorry for her words. As he was about to say more, she gently cupped his cheek and soothingly stroked it.</p>
<p>Richard stood still, as if frozen by her touch. Meeting his piercing blue eyes, Jasmine gave an awkward smile.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I meant it as a joke, I didn’t think it would upset you.”</p>
<p>I won’t do it again.</p>
<p>Richard remained silent for a moment. As the silence stretched, Jasmine thought, ‘I did what I always did when my older brothers were genuinely upset, but maybe this feels too much like soothing a child.’ Just then, his sudden breath close to her made her catch her breath.</p>
