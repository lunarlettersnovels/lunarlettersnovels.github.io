            <h3>Chapter 63.1</h3>
<p>He may have been in denial the whole time, not realizing that she was seeing someone else. Furthermore, the ensuing conversation was a series of shocks.</p>
<p>“No, this is not the case! No matter if your part of the Grand Duchy, you treat people like this… I only told you good things. Are you ignoring our Marquis family?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Despite the flames flickering in Richard’s eyes at the nonsense pouring from the man’s mouth, Jasmine herself, appearing tired and annoyed, merely sighed without showing any anger.</p>
<p>The way she handled the situation, as if it were nothing out of the ordinary, was shocking.</p>
<p>“Lord Peterson, come to your senses. I think you’re making a huge mistake. You have no right or reason to demand anything from me. Do you think we’re in some kind of significant relationship? What do you know about me? Aren’t you embarrassed to call us lovers?”</p>
<p>“…Of course not. In love? Me?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, I can’t stand it.”</p>
<p>It was the same expression he had seen before. Eyes that seemed indifferent, as if there was no point in getting angry. Ruthless and scornful mockery. His heart sank in a different way.</p>
<p>She laughed at love—she was like a different person from the one he knew.</p>
<p>It felt as though she was mocking the emotion itself to the extent that her previous declarations of love felt like lies.</p>
<p>The Jasmine, who had always been honest with her emotions and cherished them, seemed to have disappeared somewhere.</p>
<p>It felt unfamiliar and unsettling, and seeing a man discarded so mercilessly made Richard feel bitter and troubled. It was as if he was the one standing in that place.</p>
<p>Their last cold and hot summer night. The memory of that day was a significant blow to Richard in many ways. Enough to come up in dreams several times.</p>
<p>He could vaguely feel it. Jasmine had changed, just as Richard had also been worn down and gradually changed over the past six months. The breakup hadn’t left traces only on him.</p>
<p>Even if the direction was completely opposite.</p>
<p>When Jasmine and his eyes met again, she simply glanced past him as if she hadn’t seen him. She pursed her dry lips.</p>
<p>Whether it was fortunate or not for Richard that the stupid fool pulled Jasmine, it was unclear. Nevertheless, Richard, who couldn’t bear to watch any longer, quickly intervened, forcefully pushing the man away from Jasmine. He revealed his teethg, even if it meant encroaching on his territory.</p>
<p>“Have you forgotten the rank of aristocrats, Peterson, even though you are just a footman without any title?”</p>
<p>The emperor’s sword and the highest-ranking aristocrat, the Duke of Aion, held enough power and influence to diminish the perceived differences in status among aristocrats.</p>
<p>It wasn’t unusual for him to step forward according to court rules. It’s only natural to act chivalrously towards a lady in need.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>He hoped that despite his unnecessary interference and various excuses, she wouldn’t be upset. Jasmine, lips pressed as if weighed down by various complicated thoughts, glanced at Richard.</p>
<p>Jasmine remained silent for a moment. Then, with a delayed sigh, she responded. Her voice was tinged with fatigue, causing Richard’s eyebrow to flinch.</p>
<p>“Yes. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Even with such a polite expression of gratitude, neither of them seemed at ease. An uncomfortable and tense silence lingered.</p>
<p>Jasmine, as if unable to bear it, slightly furrowed her brow for a moment, then smoothed it out and held the edge of her skirt.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your assistance, Duke Aion. I should be going now.”</p>
<p>A restless voice grabbed her as she turned away without a trace of regret.</p>
<p>“Just a moment, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>How long has it been since he called her name?</p>
<p>Jasmine hesitated and turned back. She had tried to avoid his gaze, but those persistent blue eyes were the kind she couldn’t escape from.</p>
<p>That captivating allure in his beautiful exterior had captivated Jasmine from the first time she saw him, and she had never succeeded in resisting it.</p>
<p>Especially when he stared at her with such persistence, how could she avoid it?</p>
<p>“May I… escort you?”</p>
<p>He was worried about letting her go alone.</p>
<p>His softly spoken gaze was direct and clear. He had said something similar when they met at the evening party.</p>
<p>Jasmine felt an inevitable sense of déjà vu in this situation, comparing it to the past and feeling the clear difference between then and now.</p>
<p>At that time, his emotion was all about expressing embarrassing and awkward concerns, but today, there was something very dark and desolate about him, like a depleted well.</p>
<p>At first glance, the atmosphere had changed from before. He appeared somewhat rougher and more severe. Still, his appearance exuded the same neatness and aristocratic elegance, yet Jasmine keenly caught onto the subtle change.</p>
<p>Was it because his face seemed more gaunt? Jasmine, who had been watching him closely, spoke in a tone that was much more composed than before. It was firm and brief.</p>
<p>“No. It would be best for each of us to go our separate ways from here.”</p>
