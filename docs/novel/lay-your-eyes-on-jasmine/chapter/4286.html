            <p><strong>Chapter 37.1</strong></p>
<p>“What happened this morning?”</p>
<p>“This morning? What morning? It’s already noon. Can’t you see that the sun is up?”</p>
<p>Jilian waited for Richard all morning. He eventually sent someone after him. He clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>Only then did Richard, who had been adjusting his appearance roughly and running his hands through his messy hair, glance at the sunlight pouring through the window and the clock pointed out by the prince.</p>
<p>When did it become like this? It was not even morning; it was already noon.</p>
<p>He lost track of time, staring at Jasmine’s sleeping face. Richard was only forced to leave the bedroom when the messenger sent by the prince came.</p>
<p>Even though it wasn’t far and he wouldn’t be away for long, the small face sleeping under the covers had delayed him, causing him to come out a bit later.</p>
<p>And even as he walked down the corridor, he regained some self-control. Only now did his mind clear, and he felt relieved, but the cousin who interrupted his good time was annoying.</p>
<p>“So, why did you call me?”</p>
<p>And that didn’t change even after he realized it was quite late. When Richard came out shamelessly without raising an eyebrow, Jilian spat a sigh.</p>
<p>“Look at you. It’s nice to see not being so pretentious for the first time in a long while. Did you enjoy it?”</p>
<p>The prince put his legs on the desk, and Richard shifted the teacup to the right while pushing his feet away. No one knew the Crown Prince behaved like this.</p>
<p>While picking the biscuits among the snacks on the table, Richard suddenly thought of Jasmine, who loved stuffing herself with sweet, high-calorie food after every time they had se!x.</p>
<p>Although she, unlike other young ladies her age, didn’t particularly like sweets, she preferred healthy, fresh, and plain food. However, after their lovemaking, she tended to seek high-calorie and rich dishes, perhaps due to fatigue. A charming habit indeed.</p>
<p>A picture of a petite woman wearing his shirt, waving her bare legs while munching on fluffy toast filled with cheese, nuts, and sweet honey came into his mind.</p>
<p>It was indeed a delicious sight. Well, not that it wasn’t. Richard had often felt se!xual arousal witnessing such a scene after spending the night, making it quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Jasmine, who was sensitive when eating, he would have laid her on that table several times and devoured her.  He rationalized his impulse by saying it was morning and the woman was too sensual.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an excuse for someone who had already grabbed Jasmine when she opened her eyes most mornings, but not that it mattered to him. He also had his fair share of gently soothing her by serving her.</p>
<p>After feeding her strawberries, he gently licked her tongue for the taking. Her plump lips turned even redder. The pale purple eyes glared at him with dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>“Ah, really! I told you not to touch when eating!”</p>
<p>“Please eat. I have something else to eat.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah!”</p>
<p>Lifting the oversized shirt from her ample bosom, long fingers swept over her thigh. Just that made her hidden part moist, and he laughed silently.</p>
<p>He kneaded her butt0cks and kissed her quivering ear and the nape of her neck. With each movement, her chest, trembled frome xcitement.</p>
<p>“You smell sweet.”</p>
<p>So, indeed, he said it was appetizing.</p>
<p>Her large hands grabbed her ankles and spread her legs, making her lean against the table. His casual movements  didn’t look like he was about to ravage her.</p>
<p>Her cheeks were as red as her erect cu!nt, dripping like an animal in her heat. He gently rubs her sensitive cl!t and pressed hard.</p>
<p>“No matter how much you eat, ugh!”</p>
<p>“Ah! Richard! Slowly… Ah!”</p>
<p>“Shh, swallow it well.”</p>
<p>With each word, he thrust his throbbing pen!s, as if nailing her to the table. After inserting his large co!ck into her petite body in one go, he swallowed a sigh. He looked down at the woman whose eyes were moist.</p>
<p>Her full and soft body was spread out, their hips connected. Sugar and cream were still on her lips as she frowned. It was a scene too much for him.</p>
<p>It looked so sexy and cute as she stroked her bulging lower abdomen with her small hands as if her stomach was hurting. He laughed and flicked her sweet lips with his tongue.</p>
<p>“Is it too much?”</p>
<p>“That’s… ah, wait!”</p>
<p>“We did it all night yesterday.”</p>
<p>Considering how much he poured into her, it was regrettable that the small space inside still struggled to accept him.</p>
<p>Is it because her love was transparent and sweet? It could be because he and Jasmine fit remarkably well in terms of personality. He became strangely possessive and rougher in bed.</p>
