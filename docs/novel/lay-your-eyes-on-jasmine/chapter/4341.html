            <h3><strong>Chapter 9</strong></h3>
<p>Why does he appear lonely and tired even when he smiles? Why does he seem like he’s sacrificing something? She couldn’t comprehend it. As he had mentioned, refraining from irresponsible behavior should be normal.</p>
<p>Jasmine, who had felt a hint of resentment, wiped her eyes and returned to her bed, drifting off to sleep. The next day, just like any other day, she observed the impeccably gallant Duke of Aion. His face, immaculate and orderly, shone as he took the oath as the representative of the graduating class, saluted, and received the sparkling medal. Everything seemed like a facade.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Richard was promptly deployed to the battlefield and experienced a remarkably rapid promotion, becoming a deputy commander. While he made steady progress, his father, the former Duke, passed away during the conflict. Richard briefly returned to the capital and succeeded his father’s title.</p>
<p>The entire capital buzzed with excitement over the emergence of a war hero. The young man who knelt before the Emperor had a more mature countenance than a few years ago.</p>
<p>As he continued to grow and develop into a more impressive individual, Jasmine found herself falling for him once again.</p>
<p>That person continued to advance. Steadily, ceaselessly.</p>
<p><em>I want to be like that too. Perhaps right by your side…</em></p>
<p>…It was like that.</p>
<p>“You’re not perfect. Wake up!”</p>
<p>Jasmine let out a frustrated chuckle, feeling vexed by love and nonsense. <em>Just shut up already. Even the great Richard or the rising star of society! You’re not perfect!</em></p>
<p>Hahaha! Take that!</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>THere was a snort. Jasmine, who had felt somewhat relieved after venting her frustration, furrowed her brow slightly in confusion at the sound.</p>
<p>For some reason, the Duke covered his eyes and chuckled.</p>
<p><em>Well, well. Did he become so infuriated that he lost his mind?</em></p>
<p>As Jasmine let out an exasperated breath at her own irrational assumption, Richard raised his head. Suddenly breaking into laughter like a maniac, his previously composed face now seemed oddly calm. Jasmine, whose unease had grown, opened her eyes wide in disbelief. The once poised and indifferent Richard now spoke.</p>
<p>“What? What! Do you understand how bad it will be if rumors spread? Do you even know about that? Do you dare ignore me to such an extent?” she furiously chided him. Jasmine had read too many romance novels about swordsmen.</p>
<p>But Duke Aion’s response was only…</p>
<p>“Please return home now. It’s late at night.”</p>
<p>Yes, completely dismissive.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“It would be wise to drink in moderation in the future. Isn’t it risky for a young lady to wander around absentmindedly and get involved in accidents?”</p>
<p>And your honor as well, he implied.</p>
<p>After kindly offering advice, he gave Jasmine a fleeting look and left the room with impeccable manners. She stared blankly at the closed door, her face turning tomato red as time passed. Finally, she clenched her fists and exploded.</p>
<p>“Richard Aion, you jinxed brat!”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The morning after a heavy rain in the early dawn, the air felt fresh and invigorating. With perfect weather for hunting, some high-ranking nobles embarked on picnics or headed to their own hunting grounds.</p>
<p>As always, Princess Nysa, responsible for maintaining the royal ambiance, carried a hunting rifle on her shoulder and laughed heartily.</p>
<p>“The weather is ideal for hunting! Shall we go after deer today? I needed to get Jay’s gloves resized anyway.”</p>
<p>Throughout, Nysa playfully prodded Richard, who had remained silent all along, attempting to engage him in conversation. He was typically reserved, but today his responses were limited to ‘yeah,’ ‘whatever,’ and ‘sure.’ It was unusual for him to agree to her sudden suggestion to go hunting by bursting into the study.</p>
<p>Normally, he would have said, “What nonsense are you talking about? Don’t bother me,” and chased her away. He’s truly acting strangely today, isn’t he?</p>
<p>“Hey! Why are you like this after coming all the way to the hunting grounds? Are you hungover?”</p>
<p>Richard irritably swatted her hand away, frowning at the word ‘hungover.’</p>
<p>“I haven’t even touched alcohol.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I saw you having a boring time.”</p>
<p>This gloomy guy had acted like a pompous bore and abruptly disappeared in the middle of their conversation. Then he reappeared as if he had just been fooling around. She had thought that if she came out to play with him again, she wouldn’t be human. Yet she still joined him for hunting the next day, so she was just as guilty. Nysa scratched her cheek and inquired.</p>
<p>“But you left first. Where did you go?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Richard pulled out a cigarette without responding and lit it. The way he exhaled after taking a drag was strangely composed for such a bright day.</p>
<p>His mood today was the complete opposite of hers, which had improved. However, she couldn’t say she felt bad. It was as if his attention had been diverted elsewhere entirely. Even though he had nearly quit smoking since going to the war zone, why suddenly…</p>
<p>“Nysa.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Richard, who had been silent for a moment, suddenly spoke up, catching Nysa off guard.</p>
<p>“Am I unlucky?”</p>
