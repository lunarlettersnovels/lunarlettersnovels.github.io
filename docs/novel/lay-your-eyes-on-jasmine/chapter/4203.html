            <h3>Chapter 78.2</h3>
<p>As Jasmine’s imagination slowly traced his body with an imaginary hand, her face grew hot. She was losing it. She must be mad with lust. It felt as though his angry, aroused manho.od was right there in her hand.</p>
<p>That heat, the obscene size and texture, the taste… she knew it all.</p>
<p>Jasmine tried to deny it, but the more she did, the faster her imagination ran.</p>
<p>If she stroked him and teased him, Richard would pant desperately, gritting his teeth before kissing her roughly and parting her legs. His predatory movements were maddeningly ero.tic.</p>
<p>He would climb up her thighs, roughly squeezing her bu.tto.cks, and push his body between her legs. Then he would firmly grab her bre.asts through her clothes, and deepening the kiss.</p>
<p>In her mind, she could feel his hands roughly kneading her bre.asts, her nip.ples stiffening under the teasing touches, and as she moa.ned busily, Richard would trail his lips down, biting her neck as he always did.</p>
<p>His hands, which had been groping her bu.tto.cks, would slip inside her thighs, spreading her legs wider and stimulating her there. She was already wet from the moment she touched him.</p>
<p>As if there wasn’t enough time to undress, he would push her underwear aside and thrust his fingers inside her, pressing on her most sensitive spot.</p>
<p>Ah! Jasmine wouldn’t know what to do, her body writhing under his heavy frame. Richard, panting, would press his erect length against her hand, rubbing frantically. The shame and pleasure of having her small hand treated like a toy would drive her mad.</p>
<p>Hah, ugh. Jasmine.</p>
<p>Ah, ah!</p>
<p>Good. Do you like it?</p>
<p>Yes! Ah!</p>
<p>Da.mn it, can I do it? No, I will. Ha, ugh! Even if you say no, I will.</p>
<p>Open yourself to me quickly. His crude whispering would accompany the withdrawal of his fingers from her now aching core.</p>
<p>As she cried, her legs weak, he would spread them wide and lift them. Panting like a beast, he would rub his slickened arousal between her cro.tch.</p>
<p>While she was dazed, the tip of his co.ck, slipping and rubbing against her moist petals, would find her hole.</p>
<p>He would penetrate her.</p>
<p>Sluuuurp, thunk!</p>
<p>A dizzying stream of excited curses rang in her ears.</p>
<p>Ha, fu.ck, you’re tight.</p>
<p>Ah, ah, ah!</p>
<p>With several quick thrusts, he would bury himself completely inside her, filling her with his entire length. Completely buried within her, he would whisper lewd words in her ear as his co.ck thrust in and out quickly.</p>
<p>The friction of their pelvises meeting, the noise growing louder, matched by his harsh breathing and explicit groans, would make her head spin with a mix of shame and pleasure.</p>
<p>Just when it seemed gentle, he would thrust violently, with a slapping sound. His pub.ic hair and balls slap against her butt.ocks, marked with his fingerprints. He thrusts so hard that her pubic bone bumps against his. The obscene sound of pe.nis slapping against her wet pu.ssy grows louder and louder.</p>
<p>This ecstasy, this feeling! The sensation of his thick, vulgar manho.od conquering her completely, his wild thrusting that made her feel as though she was being devoured, she screamed out, her body jolting up and down.</p>
<p>The voluptuous, white bre.asts bounced and jiggled wildly, and on that quivering flesh, the sweaty man bared his teeth. When he bit down hard, the nip.ples reddened as if they were bursting with juice. Despite her mo.ans, he continued to delve deeply into her, heating her from below.</p>
<p>Hah, Jasmine, Jasmine….</p>
<p>Her legs, draped over his shoulders, shook wildly. She saw the man’s eyes gleaming. He fu.cked her for a long time. Then, with one leg spread wide, he plunged deeply and twisted her until, like mating animals, he had her on all fours.</p>
<p>Her soft bu.tto.cks squeezed with each powerful thrust. Her insides were a blend of pleasure and dull pain, which she relished. She matched his rhythm, her hips moving rocking frantically. He smacked her bu.tto.cks as if in approval, driving him to thrust faster, harder.</p>
<p>Thump, thump, thump! Ahhh! Her bre.asts were gripped tightly in his hands, and as he thrust deep, he spurted his seed entirely inside her. He ground his hips slowly, making sure she swallowed every drop, his tes.tes wet and clinging to her before separating.</p>
<p>As Jasmine shuddered in climax, Richard leisurely finished his ejacu.lation, parting her soft pubic hair and rubbing her clit.oris. Jasmine gasped as she came, his bloodshot eyes greedily watching her every reaction.</p>
<p>Just like his eyes right now.</p>
<p>They witnessed themselves rolling and thrashing passionately in each other’s eyes.</p>
