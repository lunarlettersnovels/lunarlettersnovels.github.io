            <p><strong>Chapter 20.2</strong></p>
<p>Da.mn it.</p>
<p>His chest felt like it was burning. He pressed his face roughly against hers, urgently tasting her small lips, licking and sucking them in a frenzy. He shed the veneer of politeness, becoming more licentious and savage.</p>
<p>But wasn’t lust supposed to be like this?</p>
<p>Moving down to her neck, he nibbled and licked it softly, eliciting a brief m0an from her. She had a sensitive body. Her skin emitted a sweet scent that tantalized his senses. He buried his nose in her nape and inhaled her subtle fragrance. It was enough to make him fully erect.</p>
<p>Richard let out a bitter laugh.</p>
<p>This was driving him crazy. Was saying “I like you” enough to excite him?</p>
<p><em>I thought she would hate me.</em></p>
<p>Exhaling a ragged breath, their lips met again. She was assertive. She might not have known what to do or how to do it, but her desire to touch him was so palpable that it overwhelmed him. The blend of inexperience and honesty left his mind in a daze.</p>
<p>They clung to each other and rolled around on the bed. His hand moved from her shoulders down to her back, softly lifting her skirt and caressing her smooth legs.</p>
<p>As his fingers reached her fair thighs and brushed against her pant!es, he finally regained some semblance of consciousness. He felt like an inexperienced youth, completely lost in his desires.</p>
<p>Even Jasmine, well, she could be excused, but he had been swept away, too. He removed his shirt and tossed it carelessly onto the floor.</p>
<p>He wanted to give this woman a night she would never forget.</p>
<p>“Wait,” he murmured.</p>
<p>Slowly. There’s plenty of time.</p>
<p>Jasmine found Richard’s soft kisses on her cheek irritating as he tried to pacify her, but his exposed upper body was so beautiful that she was captivated. His sleek and well-toned physique flowed with sensuality, like the body of a racehorse.</p>
<p>His body was free from imperfections, from his chiseled jaw to his well-balanced abdominal muscles. His taut chest muscles and the sensual definition of his abdomen contrasted with his refined face, making him appear sensual and sultry.</p>
<p>Why did his face seem so cool while his body was so hot?</p>
<p>As she lost herself in thought, his lips descended to her ear. He nibbled softly on her earlobe, and the man with a well-defined upper body whispered something seduct!ve into her ear.</p>
<p>“Do you like it?”</p>
<p>Startled, she opened her mouth to speak, but as his tongue gently entered her ear, she gasped and sealed her lips. A mixture of pleasure and surprise left her head spinning.</p>
<p>Why is this so intense? Is this how intimacy between a man and a woman is supposed to be? It differed from what she had admired before, and that confusion was both disorienting and exciting. She was going crazy.</p>
<p>Jasmine shivered as Richard skillfully removed her ribbon and gently slid his hand from her neckline down to her round shoulder, and collarbone, and then teasingly uncovered her bare back.</p>
<p>His lips, which had been nibbling her earlobe, descended to her exposed nape, and she exhaled a warm breath, not wanting to cause him any pain.</p>
<p>I can’t take it anymore. Watching him trail kisses down her neckline and chest, Jasmine couldn’t help herself and grabbed his nape, pulling him up to kiss him. This time, they didn’t hold back; their tongues intertwined eagerly.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>They ardently embraced each other, diving into the kiss as if in a hurry.</p>
<p>The sensation of their tongues mingling, exchanging saliva and warmth, and the sharing of their breath and excitement left no room for thought. Everything, from who they were to where they were, lost meaning.</p>
<p>Only the scent of their partner’s body, their yearning for each other, and the mutual desire to possess one another filled their minds. Their partner’s excitement became their own.</p>
<p>Jasmine had never experienced such emotions in her life. It felt urgent, exhilarating, almost maddening. It was incredible, but she wanted more. So when he reluctantly pulled away, leaving her heart empty, she thought she might cry.</p>
<p>Seeing the flushed cheeks under his eyes, she swallowed hard.</p>
<p>His large hand enclosed her blushing cheek, stroking it gently before planting soft kisses. The slow kisses felt even more sensual than their previous fervor.</p>
<p>Maybe it was his other hand, half-fumbling with her dress, yanking it down and exposing her pert brea!sts, that added to the sensation. His unskilled fingers teasingly brushed her skin, and when they reached their peak and circled, she m0aned softly.</p>
<p>Jasmine watched as his lips moved lower and lower along her body, and a thrilling sensation tingled in the pit of her stomach.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was when his inexperienced fingers reached their apex, and he began to caress and explore, that the m0an escaped her lips. She gazed at him with clouded eyes as he descended, kissing her and leaving a trail of soft, slow kisses.</p>
<p>Maybe it was his other hand, tugging her dress down, causing her to spring forth, as it tightly gripped her brea!st, that intensified her excitement. His unpracticed fingers sent her over the edge, and she couldn’t help but gasp.</p>
<p>Jasmine watched, her vision hazy, as he took the remaining brea@st into his mouth. Her back tingled with sensation.</p>
<p>As her pink n!pple, along with her tongue, disappeared into his mouth, she couldn’t help but m0an. The sensation of satisfaction, tinged with embarrassment, sent a shiver through her lower abdomen.</p>
