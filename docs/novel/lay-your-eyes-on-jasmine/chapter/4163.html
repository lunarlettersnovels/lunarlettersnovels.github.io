            <h3>Chapter 99.1</h3>
<p>“Why aren’t you out of the empire already?” The last part was said quietly enough that Jasmine couldn’t hear it, but since Duke Aion had leaned forward like a predator, Charles heard it clearly.</p>
<p>Charles, pale with fear from the menacing aura, couldn’t even respond. Seeing this, Jasmine, who was already bewildered by the sudden situation, intervened sharply.</p>
<p>She was flustered by the unexpected intrusion and felt that Richard, who had suddenly barged in, was intimidating an innocent person (which was indeed the case).</p>
<p>“What are you doing right now, Duke Aion?”</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Richard’s expression instantly became composed as he turned to look at Jasmine with softened eyes. The dramatic change in his demeanor left Jasmine blinking in disbelief. She wondered if she had seen it wrong, but she was certain that Richard, who had intruded between them, had looked murderous just moments ago.</p>
<p>Did they have some kind of grudge between them that I didn’t know about? With my mind frozen in confusion, all sorts of thoughts crossed my mind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Richard responded calmly. He naturally pulled out the chair next to Jasmine and sat down. The movement was so fluid that neither Jasmine nor Charles could stop him.</p>
<p>“I was just giving some appropriate advice to the second son of Marquis Alexander.”</p>
<p>It seems he still hasn’t found his proper place.</p>
<p>His rich, mid-to-low voice resonated like a finely played instrument. It was the kind of precise and authoritative tone one might use during a speech in the assembly, noble and old-fashioned, designed to instill confidence in the speaker.</p>
<p>Then, he leisurely tapped the table with his long index finger. In an instant, the common outdoor café in the capital felt like a military courtroom or his office.</p>
<p>Richard’s piercing blue eyes remained fixed on Charles, who grew paler under the intense gaze. Unable to bear it any longer, Jasmine called out to him again.</p>
<p>“Richard.”</p>
<p>He turned to her immediately, like a well-trained Doberman, and Jasmine looked at him with an indescribable expression.</p>
<p>It felt as though she could almost read his mind, yet not understand it at all. After days of no contact, why had he suddenly appeared here? And how did he know she was here?</p>
<p>“How on earth did you…”</p>
<p>She started to ask, her voice rising in agitation, but then let out a sigh. There were many eyes on them. Even before, there had been glances due to Jasmine’s presence, but with Duke Aion’s sudden intrusion, the number of onlookers had doubled, including those from the street.</p>
<p>Richard seemed completely unconcerned, but Jasmine had enough sense to realize that the presence of the nation’s war hero and military minister, the Duke, could lead to rumors that might harm her reputation. She sighed and turned to Charles.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Charles. I think it’s best if we say our goodbyes here.”</p>
<p>She hadn’t wanted their final farewell to be like this. Feeling a bit upset, she glared at Richard, who looked like a well-fed predator. Charles, sensing her thoughts, smiled awkwardly. He stood up and bowed.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll be going. Thank you, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Take care of yourself. You don’t need to send me a wedding invitation.”</p>
<p>Charles couldn’t help but laugh lightly at her playful remark. He nodded and walked away, and Jasmine stood to see him off. Once he was out of sight, she immediately turned her gaze to Richard, who was sitting calmly. Seeing his face, still as striking as ever, irritated her.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here, Duke Aion?”</p>
<p>“I happened to see you while walking by.”</p>
<p>“Happened to?”</p>
<p>The timing seemed too suspicious. Jasmine was doubtful, but Richard’s brazen attitude made her reconsider. If it wasn’t a coincidence, would he have had someone follow her?</p>
<p>Given her own fame, Jasmine’s daily activities and whereabouts often became gossip or made it into the rumor columns. Though she couldn’t imagine Richard sifting through gossip columns.</p>
<p>“Fine, let’s say that’s true. What was with your attitude earlier? Did something happen between you and Charles?”</p>
<p>“Charles?”</p>
<p>Richard slowly repeated the name she had mentioned.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize you were on such familiar terms to call him by his first name.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with that between friends?”</p>
<p>“Do friends go on dates and visit country houses together? Just the two of you?”</p>
<p>Richard’s concise question suggested he hadn’t realized how convenient friendship could be. His detached expression suggested he wasn’t particularly bothered, but his tone carried an edge. Jasmine tilted her head skeptically, feeling a twinge of irritation.</p>
<p>“I don’t see why the nature of my friendships is any of your concern, Duke.”</p>
<p>“My apologies. It was just a genuine question.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>Jasmine responded coldly. Richard immediately drew back and, with a level of politeness that bordered on submissive, apologized.</p>
<p>“If I overstepped, I apologize. I was out of line.”</p>
<p>His immediate compliance made it difficult for Jasmine to continue the conversation. She looked at him with a sense of unease, his eyes lowered, waiting patiently for her leniency. Was he a fox or a wolf? She sighed briefly.</p>
<p>“Fine. But next time you see Charles, I want you to apologize. He’s a kind and good person. He made a difficult decision to protect his family.”</p>
<p>“Is that so.”</p>
<p>Richard responded compliantly, but his eyes showed little interest. Somehow, despite his submissive posture, his blue eyes reminded her of a disgruntled husky.</p>
