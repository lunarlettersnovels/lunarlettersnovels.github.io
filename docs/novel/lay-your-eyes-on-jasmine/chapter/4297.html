            <p><strong>Chapter 31.2</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine, considered one of the most beautiful women in the high society filled with handsome men and lovely ladies, had never seen a man more handsome than Richard.</p>
<p>One might wonder, “Is there a man like him?” But he actually existed. That made her even crazier.</p>
<p><em>‘Ha, I also chose a tough and tricky opponent.’</em> She slapped his forehead and sighed.</p>
<p>Oh, well, it’s even more precious because he’s hard to get.</p>
<p>Jasmine chuckled softly, walking slowly along the forest path. The gentle breeze swayed the branches happily, and birds sang their songs. She didn’t feel like hunting, but her mood wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>Even so, her thoughts were filled with a single person. It had been some time since she had time alone, and recently, there hadn’t been any moments when they weren’t together. She enjoyed the change of pace.</p>
<p>Jasmine contemplated deeply.</p>
<p>What should she do to change the current situation and get what she wants? It seemed like he held the upper hand in their relationship, but it was still a matter of perspective when she thought about it carefully.</p>
<p>In the end, she liked him and hoped he would like her too. Of course, you can’t force someone’s feelings, but the responsibility in the relationship remains.</p>
<p>So, at the very least, she needed to ask about his feelings.</p>
<p>He had said several times that he liked her, but she didn’t know if it was his fondness for their lovemaking, as a conversation partner, or something deeper. She thought she was being a little nitpicky, but it was quite natural.</p>
<p>Richard had never explained his feelings towards her. To be precise, they never had the opportunity.</p>
<p>“So, I guess we need to talk.”</p>
<p>While some friends might approach love and romance as a game, trying things like testing the waters, playing hard to get, or inciting jealousy, Jasmine didn’t know much about those tactics.</p>
<p>When your heart was racing and your vision blurred, how could you make calculated decisions and enjoy it? Jasmine’s temperament was not cut out for these high-risk emotional games.</p>
<p>Even if Richard and Jasmine were opposite sides, she would probably face him head-on. This was a difference in their personalities.</p>
<p>And that’s why she let out a sigh. What else could she do? That was her nature…</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Just seeing that smiling face made Jasmine’s mind go blank. She smiled broadly as the man ran toward her side.</p>
<p>“Did you catch many?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Not really. Why are you here alone?”</p>
<p>“Just wanted to take a walk.”</p>
<p>Jasmine smiled gently, and Richard carefully studied her face, as if he was someone trying not to step on a carefully bloomed flower. Then he reached out, tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, and brushed her cheek lightly.</p>
<p>“You seem lost in thought.”</p>
<p>Somewhat perceptive. This man, who appeared calm and emotionally indifferent, was surprisingly multi-faceted as you got to know him. He was careful, had a tender affection, and was quite wise. He smiled readily in front of her.</p>
<p>To imagine such a calm face revealing various expressions and emotions was beyond belief.</p>
<p>So, it was even more challenging. There was a clear gap that hadn’t been narrowed yet. His eyes were sometimes aloof and different, while at other times, they were terribly warm. Jasmine couldn’t help but be tossed around.</p>
<p>Jasmine smiled beautifully and politely removed his hand, lightly touching her cheek. It was an unconscious movement, something both of them might not notice, given how natural it was.</p>
<p>“I got tired of the crowd.”</p>
<p>“I was looking for you for a while.”</p>
<p>Without further questioning, Richard simply moved closer to her side. As the gap between them gradually diminished, he acted like it wasn’t comfortable for them to be apart. She quickly turned her horse around in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you supposed to be with the Crown Prince?”</p>
<p>“He can have fun without me. It’s okay.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, you two seem to get along well.”</p>
<p>“Well, we practically grew up together. My father cherished him dearly.”</p>
<p>With no mother in the palace, Duke Aion always did everything for his niece, who was left alone after his mother’s passing. Sometimes, it seemed like the Duke loved him more than his son, Richard.</p>
<p>Did that bother him? Well, at the time, not really, as he considered him more important, as he was the future emperor and his only cousin.</p>
<p>It’s not like… Richard glanced away and looked at her hands.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t catch what I wanted to give you.”</p>
<p>“What did you want to give me? You even caught a stag.”</p>
<p>Jasmine asked, remembering the horn-blowing sounds she heard earlier. Moreover, if Duke Aion gave her the prey, all eyes would be on her.</p>
<p>Of course, she would feel good, but she didn’t want to feel the need for unnecessary boasting in this situation. She would like to brag about her ideal lover’s status, but it was currently inconvenient.</p>
<p>Richard scanned her face in response to her words. He replied, “Hmm, maybe a little rabbit or something.”</p>
<p>“Rabbit?”</p>
<p>What are you talking about, her face seemed to say. Richard chuckled at her bewildered expression. His face was like that of a mischievous young boy.</p>
<p>“You look like one.”</p>
<p>“A rabbit?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>What kind of nonsense is this? Jasmine laughed at his boyish smile. What rabbit. This guy.</p>
<p>“Even though I’m known as the flower of high society, rabbits aren’t elegant or pretty; they’re more…”</p>
<p>“Cute. Just like you.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, his voice was close. When her eyes widened, Richard had already bent down, kissing her cheek.</p>
