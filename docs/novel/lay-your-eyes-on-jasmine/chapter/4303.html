            <p><strong>Chapter 28.2</strong></p>
<p><em>‘You have a way with words that can be misleading.’ </em>Jasmine was about to say so but closed her eyes, ignoring his serious expression. Everything was exasperating. Lifting a finger against him seemed nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the kisses he rained down on her face and the warm hands spreading the hot milky fluid across her lower abdomen felt subdued, as if her senses were mellowed.</p>
<p>“Wash me. It’s hard.”</p>
<p>“As you wish.”</p>
<p>He kissed Jasmine’s eyelids and cradled her in his arms. As he tenderly stroked her back, which stuck out like a small bird, Richard suddenly felt an unfamiliar sensation.</p>
<p>A stable sense of contentment bloomed as if he had unwittingly plucked a flower and held it, radiating perfect warmth. It was a strange feeling.</p>
<p>He observed her sleeping face for a long time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>If there’s a secret many people don’t know, Richard, the Iron Blood Duke, is rather moody.</p>
<p>Most of the time, this aspect of his character was so subtle that it remained invisible to the outside world. Only close friends, family, or long-time associates who had spent considerable time with him were privy to the occasional moments when he would remark, “Oh, I’m not in the best mood,” or “I’m feeling a bit agitated.”</p>
<p>This was because he maintained unwavering control over his emotions and despised losing his composure.</p>
<p>However, his obsession with control seemed to wane over the past few days…</p>
<p>“It seems like things are going well.”</p>
<p>As Richard’s shot accurately felled a brown mallard, the Crown Prince, observing through binoculars with crystal lenses, smiled.</p>
<p>At first, Richard thought it was just a compliment, but when he turned his head and met his cousin’s gaze, he realized the solemn look at them. Richar’s eyebrows narrowed. He interrupted smoothly. “Stop staring.”</p>
<p>“What should I do?”</p>
<p>Jilian replied sternly, skillfully controlling his beloved horse. At first, he seemed calm and cold. But Richard knew how his cousin acted in moments like this. It’s been over 20 years since they were considered family with a future military connection.</p>
<p>Jilian smiled and steered his horse slowly. Richard sighed and followed closely as the prince’s attendants noticed and fell back.</p>
<p>The forest ahead was golden in the sunny summer. The brightness hurt Richard’s eyes, so he closed them. Even though it was warm, he enjoyed feeling the warm air and seeing the dense shadows of the trees.</p>
<p>He had talked about the same thing this morning. He thought it was a good day for hunting because the morning air was cool.</p>
<p>“You seem happy.”</p>
<p>The Duke looked at Jilian and said calmly, “Isn’t it because the prince is in a good mood?”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>Jilian smiled briefly and replied. At first glance, his disciplined posture reminded Richard of the younger sister, Nysa, but Jilian was an entirely different person than her.</p>
<p>For example, even though they had the same father and mother, Nysa was sometimes adventurous and cheerful, as if she was not part of the imperial family. Gillian was more like a clever wolf who pretended to be regal.</p>
<p>Richard thought this difference had nothing to do with their education or position. They just had different personalities.</p>
<p>So, which side was he closer to?</p>
<p>Ignoring these thoughts, Richard chose his words carefully when talking to the Prince. Conversations with Jilian were like a silent chess game. Usually, he tried to make fair moves so the conversation didn’t become one-sided.</p>
<p>“Is there a reason your trip took so long?”</p>
<p>Unlike his sister Nysa, Jilian didn’t like staying away from the palace for a long time, where his power was prominent. And he usually didn’t work on just one thing. As expected, Jilian looked back. It seemed Richard was right.</p>
<p>“Richard.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Have you ever thought about what you value the most?”</p>
<p>At Richard’s blank gaze, Jilian continued.</p>
<p>“For example, what would you do if you had to choose between your sister and the duke? The sword from your uncle or the horse from your aunt?”</p>
<p>Richard had a presumption. He pretended not to know and answered.</p>
<p>“My sister can handle things well without my help. She cares more about our mother than our father, so I’ll listen to her.”</p>
<p>“…You shameless guy. I wish it were that simple.” Jilian clicked his tongue and shrugged. “You act as if it doesn’t apply to you.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>When he said this, Richard looked at Jilian. He took a guess. “Is this about Sir Jonathan?”</p>
<p>The horse stopped moving slowly. Jilian took out a cigarette, and Richard lit it. After a puff of smoke, Jilian exhaled. The Crown Prince thought deeply, narrowing his eyes. Richard waited quietly.</p>
