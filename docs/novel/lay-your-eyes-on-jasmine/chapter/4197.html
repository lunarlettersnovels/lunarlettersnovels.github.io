            <p><strong>Chapter 81.2</strong></p>
<p>“Talk to him? Just how many times have we fought every time we tried to talk?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… That must be frustrating.”</p>
<p>Jasmine empathized with a vague expression.</p>
<p>“I don’t care anymore. I’m just going to live my life. If he doesn’t want a divorce, he can clean up his act or explain himself. I’m too tired to bother.”</p>
<p>Marian waved her hand dismissively, fed up with the back-and-forth letters she and her husband had exchanged. Her friends nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“Great. Hang out with us in the meantime. You’ve been too devoted to your family. Consider it a vacation.”</p>
<p>“If you get tired of Jasmine’s place, come visit our mansions.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. I don’t know how I got so lucky to have friends like you.”</p>
<p>Marian sighed, and Nikki scratched her cheek, embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Well, you used to chase down and fight any girl who messed with us. Consider it payback for those times.”</p>
<p>“Ha! Remember when that girl tried to slap Lichang for stealing her boyfriend, but Marian turned the tables on her? You would’ve made a great knight.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Lichang sighed as if remembering something she’d forgotten. Marian crossed her arms and grumbled.</p>
<p>“That really pissed me off, too. Sure, she has that image, but Lichang never messes with someone else’s boyfriend. Blaming her for some guy’s wandering eye because he couldn’t control himself is ridiculous. Why drag someone else into their mess? What an eyesore.”</p>
<p>“Well, Lichang did have that irresistible charm.”</p>
<p>Though Jasmine is now the socialite, Lichang was tall, mature, and well-developed even in their school days, earning her both envy from girls and desire from boys.</p>
<p>Her unique, aloof, and haughty attitude only added to her appeal. Her seemingly detached and indifferent demeanor attracted obsessive attention from their immature peers, whether positively or negatively.</p>
<p>Lost in thought, Lichang wore a strange expression. But even then, and now, she didn’t care much for the ‘others.’</p>
<p>“Did that happen? Honestly, I don’t remember it well.”</p>
<p>“That’s why you were even more annoying.”</p>
<p>“… Weren’t you on my side just now?”</p>
<p>“I was on the side of objective justice. I didn’t particularly like you back then either.”</p>
<p>Marian said indifferently, stirring her fruit punch with a silver spoon. Lichang agreed without a hint of offense.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I was surprised. You didn’t like me, but you still stood up for me.”</p>
<p>“It was frustrating seeing you just take it without defending yourself. Are you stupid? Knowing rumors would spread, you should’ve at least explained.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t see the point. Why explain myself to someone I don’t even know? That’s what I thought at the time.”</p>
<p>As Lichang reflected calmly, Nikki shook her head. Wow, way to give the world the cold shoulder. Marian pointed out again that Lichang’s attitude had been a big part of why she was so irritating. Jasmine, who hadn’t attended the academy but was homeschooled, could roughly imagine the situation.</p>
<p>It made sense that Lichang and Marian often clashed back then. Their personalities were too different. But people grow and mature. Lichang shrugged, accepting this.</p>
<p>“We were young.”</p>
<p>“Marian was always a loyal and righteous person. That incident brought us all closer. Remember that weird girl who pretended to be Jasmine’s friend but gossiped behind her back? Marian made her cry and run off. What’s she up to now?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right.”</p>
<p>Jasmine burst into laughter, reminiscing about her childhood. As the cherished youngest daughter of a Grand Duke’s household, Jasmine was popular and admired, but there were a few who were jealous and spiteful.</p>
<p>Some would pretend to be her friend, trying to find flaws in her. Marian, with her keen instincts like a hunting dog, always spotted and protected her friends from such people. Jasmine admired and saw Marian as a strong, admirable friend.</p>
<p>Much of Jasmine’s assertiveness came from learning and imitating Marian’s decisiveness.</p>
<p>Lost in nostalgic thoughts, Jasmine murmured, “Marian, you were my childhood hero. If you were a guy, I might’ve proposed.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. Makes me regret being born a woman.”</p>
<p>Marian replied coolly, making Jasmine clutch her heart playfully with a groan. Their friends burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Why, want to become the Grand Duke’s son-in-law?”</p>
<p>“Why not? If they’d take me as a son-in-law, I’d be loyal for life.”</p>
<p>“With Marian’s beauty and bold personality, it’s a good deal for me too.”</p>
<p>“What, are you writing wedding vows tomorrow?”</p>
<p>Feeling a twinge of jealousy, Nikki pouted, prompting Marian and Jasmine to giggle and affectionately pat Nikki’s head and shoulder.</p>
<p>“What were we talking about earlier?”</p>
<p>“Oh. We were debating whether to reunite with past lovers.”</p>
<p>Marian cut in decisively, “Then the answer’s clear. Of course, you shouldn’t.”</p>
