            <p><strong>Chapter 40.2</strong></p>
<p>“I overexerted myself yesterday, so my body isn’t feeling well. Don’t worry; I’ll get better if I rest well,” Jasmine said.</p>
<p>At the mention of overexertion, Richard’s expression became even worse.<br>
Neither the embarrassed party nor Jasmine, who was busy appeasing her feelings, knew she was squeezing and opening her hand from the feeling of self-reproach.</p>
<p>“In that case, how about having a meal? You haven’t eaten anything all day, and continuing like this will weaken your body.”</p>
<p>“I have no appetite. Sorry, but can you leave? I want to rest alone.”</p>
<p>At the explicit dismissal, Richard and even the maid, who stood at the side, watching, flinched.</p>
<p>It was not like the usual Jasmine, and among nobles, unless they were quite close and friendly, it was an expression so decisive and firm that it could easily be seen as rude. At the gentle yet sharp rejection, Richard felt an unfamiliar sensation hovering around his heart.</p>
<p>It was a stinging sensation as if a sharp blade had lightly cut the flesh. Even Richard, accustomed to handling swords, was momentarily surprised, to the point where he wanted to firmly press his chest.</p>
<p>It was undoubtedly painful if someone who wasn’t like this before treated him coldly like this.</p>
<p>In that case, he should give her the space she wanted, but he didn’t feel like doing that for some reason. His intuition told him something needed to be resolved. It poked at him. He shouldn’t just let her go; his gut was telling him there was something he needed to do.</p>
<p>As Richard stood tall and hesitated, Jasmine, who had been paying close attention to his presence, turned around with sharp eyes. It wasn’t the first time he’d seen her angry, and Richard felt dizzy as if he’d been scalded by hot water.</p>
<p>Should he have just left?</p>
<p>However, Jasmine only mumbled quietly to the large man who was looking at her. Her quiet attitude provoked even more discomfort.</p>
<p>“Did my words seem insignificant?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that… I was wondering if there’s anything else you prefer.”</p>
<p>“I won’t die from skipping a meal.”</p>
<p>Even with the carefully chosen words, Jasmine flatly rejected the suggestion. Despite Richard’s thoughtful words, her cold attitude… irritated him, and he bit down on his lips.</p>
<p>He tried to say something but eventually closed his mouth again and sighed. He rubbed his forehead. People become irritable and sensitive when they’re sick. It can’t be helped. He took a step back.</p>
<p>“Fine, I understand. I’ll send a doctor later, so you can get treated.”</p>
<p>“I said it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Richard tried to persuade her this time without any sign of backing down.</p>
<p>“If it hurts more later, what will you do?”</p>
<p>“Whether it hurts or not, it’s my body, not <em>yours</em>.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Facing Richard’s bewildered expression, Jasmine lifted her chin gracefully and spoke calmly.</p>
<p>“It’s my business. So you don’t need to worry too much.”</p>
<p>Because it’s not your responsibility. The word “responsibility” drew a clear line between them.</p>
<p>Richard felt as if the communication between them had cooled and he was rejected by the closest person to him. Even if Jasmine hadn’t specifically meant to do that, and even if she had said in a comforting tone that it wasn’t his fault she was sick, Richard still felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Ironically, responsibility was the virtue that had dominated him throughout his life. Even though responsibility played a significant role in starting his relationship with Jasmine, at that moment, the warmth of their special connection became meaningless, and he felt transformed into an unrelated stranger.</p>
<p>Richard had a hard time hiding his displeasure. He didn’t know how to express his sensitive and instinctive repulsion.</p>
<p>Besides, he didn’t care if she was sick or not.</p>
<p>“Why say such things…”</p>
<p>Richard tirelessly tried to calm his boiling emotions. With an air of restraining anger or perhaps enduring pain, he furrowed his thick eyebrows.</p>
<p>His thick eyebrows were drawn together as though he was holding back anger or pain.</p>
<p>He repeated it in his mind several times: It was Jasmine. She’s sick.</p>
<p>“Why speak like that?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jasmine didn’t say anything. She simply found his presence annoying.</p>
<p>Richard finally considered leaving. For now. Since the person wasn’t acting as usual, he should at least keep his composure. It would be wise to leave without saying anything he would regret. He knew that much from countless negotiations, strategies, and political meals.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t bear to endure his next words.</p>
<p>“If, by any chance, I’ve upset you because of my desires or if I’ve acted selfishly…”</p>
<p>“Richard, I’m really sorry.” Jasmine interrupted his words with a sigh.</p>
<p>“I just want to rest alone. We can talk later.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I’m already saying it for the second time.”</p>
<p>It felt like an impenetrable wall had been erected. Richard became as speechless as a mute person. As she turned her back from him, he felt the cool rejection again, and there was a hint of shame in his feeble heart.</p>
<p>This, too, felt unfamiliar.</p>
<p>As he left the room like a dog chased away by its owner, the unfamiliar blades of emotions swirled in his heart. His heart fluctuated uncomfortably, perhaps from anger or anxiety.</p>
<p>For someone who always neatly sorted and calmed uncertain situations with a decisive blow, he could do nothing this time.</p>
