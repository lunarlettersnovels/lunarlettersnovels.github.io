            <h3>Chapter 87.1</h3>
<p>Richard, who had been chuckling, suddenly paused and asked again, hesitating. By then, he had also stopped walking. He had taken the exam at twelve and entered the academy, but he had never thought the exam was difficult.</p>
<p>In fact, he remembered doodling for the rest of the time after finishing early, surrounded by kids who were struggling with what he thought were basic questions.</p>
<p>Back then, he wondered why others found it so hard. He even worried that the academy’s standards, known for gathering the empire’s brightest minds, might be declining because the exam was too easy. He seriously pondered what kind of person could fail such a basic test…</p>
<p>Noticing Richard’s bewilderment, Jasmine narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Why? Is it hard for Sir Richard, the prodigy and model student since birth, to understand the grades of an underachiever?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that…”</p>
<p>Actually, she was right.</p>
<p>Richard, breaking into a cold sweat, resumed walking as he searched for the right words to respond to her silence. Suddenly, it felt as if he were carrying a wild beast on his back, making his hair stand on end. He tried to handle the situation calmly but didn’t realize how much he was stumbling over his words.</p>
<p>“Maybe you’re not interested in academics. It’s, you know, a matter of aptitude. Um, when you’re young, playing is more appealing. It’s better to pursue your own path rather than just studying boringly like I did…”</p>
<p>What am I even saying? As he clumsily continued, Richard felt a wave of embarrassment and fell silent. He heard the sound of suppressed laughter from behind him. He sighed.</p>
<p>“Jasmine…”</p>
<p>“Wow, I never thought I’d see the day when Duke Aion gets flustered and starts flattering.”</p>
<p>“It’s not flattery.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s call it an excuse.”</p>
<p>“…….”</p>
<p>Indeed, people should do what suits them. As Richard fell silent, Jasmine continued to chuckle and spoke cheerfully. Her lively voice made Richard forget his worries, and he found himself absorbed in her warm tone, sweet breath, and comforting presence.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s true that I wasn’t good at studying. I got into it later when I developed a real interest. I guess my personality is such that I need a strong goal or genuine interest to fully immerse myself. When I was young, studying seemed boring, and teasing my grumpy tutors was more fun. I thought studying wouldn’t bring any money and was just dull. Now, I wish I had taken to studying earlier and gone to the academy. Most of my friends went, and sometimes I feel left out.”</p>
<p>“You would have done well.”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s refinement, knowledge, and eloquence were well-known in social circles. She was undoubtedly intelligent and capable, and if she had set her mind to it, she would have easily gotten into the academy.</p>
<p>Putting aside his childhood thoughts, Richard wondered what it would have been like if he had met her at the academy.</p>
<p>As a junior, she would have been truly adorable, wouldn’t she? Perhaps they would have become friends earlier. Watching festivals together or working on assignments. How beautiful must Jasmine have been in her academy uniform? Richard was wistful for those nonexistent times.</p>
<p>“So, there’s no such thing as a perfect childhood. Everyone’s just young. Even for me, can you imagine that I was once a troublesome underachiever? What’s important is the finished product when we grow up.”</p>
<p>Listening quietly to Jasmine’s chatter, Richard blinked. Then, slowly, his lips curved into a smile.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Is it because of what I said?”</p>
<p>Because I said you must have grown up receiving plenty of love and care, unlike me. He wondered if she felt any sense of deprivation or regret because of his words.</p>
<p>Thinking about how Jasmine had earnestly shared her not-so-smooth childhood to comfort him made Richard’s heart feel a bit ticklish.</p>
<p>Even the light complaints he had thought were just casual remarks were all her way of being considerate. Jasmine was silent for a moment before mumbling awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Well, you know, it’s just that other people’s bread always looks bigger.”</p>
<p>Richard laughed silently, his shoulders shaking. How could this woman be so lovable? She was always cheerful and honest in her interactions, yet she chose topics and ways of speaking that were considerate and pleasant for others, without prioritizing herself.</p>
<p>Even though she seemed perpetually bright, being close to her revealed her deep and thoughtful nature. It wasn’t because she still had feelings for him or felt any sense of obligation.</p>
<p>It was simply because Jasmine was that kind of person, with such selfless and cheerful habits ingrained in her.</p>
<p>There was a reason why Richard always felt comfort and joy in his conversations with her.</p>
