            <h3>Chapter 58.1</h3>
<p>“What will you do when you win? You’d be utterly useless if you ended up dying here! What’s the rush that’s got you so worked up? Get a grip. This isn’t like you.”</p>
<p>“Jil.”</p>
<p>“Why, you crazy bastard.”</p>
<p>“Then what? What’s the point of living and wasting my years here?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I find that more meaningless than dying.”</p>
<p>Jilian was at a loss for words to retort. Draped in a cloak over his bandaged upper body, Richard wrote reports on the tactical map with one hand. He had already kicked out the doctor from earlier.</p>
<p>He was once again revising a new strategy. The neatly filled pages were suddenly roughly cast aside.</p>
<p>With a glare colder than ice, the Crown Prince eyed the duke. Silently, Richard gazed down at the documents scattered by the Crown Prince, who had flown off in a rage.</p>
<p>“What if you die then?”</p>
<p>Jilian mocked Richard with his azure eyes. He slowly taunted,</p>
<p>“Will you receive praise from Jasmine Liovanni for doing a good job getting yourself killed?”</p>
<p>Whatever was said, Richard’s dry expression suddenly hardened. Jilian laughed at him icily.</p>
<p>“It’s so obvious, Richard Aion. You need to work on your poker face. Your pathetic machismo is pitiful to watch. Why, does it bother you that much that she’s living happily, forgetting about the likes of you?”</p>
<p>“Jil.”</p>
<p>“I know very well that you’re periodically losing sleep over news from the capital.”</p>
<p>News from the capital, especially gossip from social circles, was almost unavoidable until the battlefield. Unless one specifically sought information or mobilized informants.</p>
<p>Once on the battlefield, even the slightest interest in trivial news from such safe havens evaporated.</p>
<p>Richard, a battlefield freak, didn’t move except for significant political developments or important news about his family. It was because it interfered with his efforts and was bothersome.</p>
<p>But this time was different.</p>
<p>For the past six months, the duke’s secret spies have been unusually busy. They lived like they were on the battlefield, as they constantly watched for the slightest change in the mood of their master.</p>
<p>The duke’s spies, who regularly submitted reports with high spirits, were baffled when they experienced their master’s coldness for the first time.</p>
<p>What could have happened? He’s not usually like this. Did those Jiosen bastards scratch a little too deep? The ignorant ones suffered.</p>
<p>Jilian, who had been watching the chaos from the beginning of the war, was on the verge of losing his mind. He always trusted his cousin in terms of ability, but this time, he wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>He wasn’t worried about his performance in the war—it was more about Richard’s inability to control himself and his foolish actions. Although their priorities differed, his current status was concerning.</p>
<p>He wanted to rush like a crazy cow at a red flag, but when he was blocked, he felt like he was engaging in something close to self-destruction as if he was rushing to break down that wall.</p>
<p>He did it with a very calm and composed demeanor. Firm and restrained actions. The discordance was even more unsettling.</p>
<p>“You’re willing to die over one woman? You’ve lost your mind. Do you think your mother raised you to become like this? If you mess up, what about your family, your agents, your responsibilities? You don’t even think about the responsibilities you have!”</p>
<p>As the conversation progressed, Jilian’s tone grew louder. Despite his anger, there was some disappointment. Richard was so immature.</p>
<p>Jilian also had moments of being love-struck, too, but he wasn’t as reckless as this guy.</p>
<p>Richard, calmly listening to the prince’s anger, finally spoke dully.</p>
<p>“When did I say I’m going to die?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Did I say I’m going to die? Your Highness, you were the first to mention it. You should have thought about winning first.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>He just did that in case Richard turned tail and abandoned everything to return to the capital. Like that time, they were trapped in his villa from torrential rain.</p>
<p>But they received the emperor’s decree when they hastily rescheduled and returned. There was simply no room for refusal.</p>
<p>After seeing that expression on his face, Jilian couldn’t help but be worried, which only added to his anger at this sudden turn of events.</p>
<p>He lamented. My goodness. To think there would come a day when he’d worry about him deserting.</p>
<p>Richard’s expression was as calm as ever in front of Jilian. He picked up the scattered documents from the floor, brushed them, and put them on the table.</p>
<p>His eyebrows turned towards the Crown Prince. His serene face looked perfectly composed, but something in those calm eyes made Jilian frown.</p>
<p>“I will win and return. Why would I die?”</p>
<p>For whom? There was a hint of chilliness in his murmured words.</p>
<p>“This war will end quickly.”</p>
<p>Without fail.</p>
<p>Richard Aion certainly kept his word. It was a swift conclusion no one saw coming. He handled everything cleanly, from ceasefire negotiations to post-war management.</p>
<p>And when he announced his intention to return to the capital immediately—naturally, no one dared to oppose his will.</p>
<p>Looking back at the entire process, Jilian sighed lightly before raising his hand. “Just do as you wish,” he said wearily.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Did you even need my permission?”</p>
<p>At Jilian’s question, tinted with grumpiness, the corner of Richard’s lips tugged upwards. He offered no response, his eyes fixed on the letter.</p>
