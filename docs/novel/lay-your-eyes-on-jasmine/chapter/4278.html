            <p><strong>Chapter 41.1</strong></p>
<p>When Jasmine woke up, the sun had already set. She yawned and stretched lazily, feeling lethargic. Her hands absentmindedly scratched her tousled hair.</p>
<p>Certainly, taking a nap was the best when stress was overwhelming. Her mixed emotions had not completely disappeared, but they had somewhat subsided. The day was already coming to an end.</p>
<p>She got up slowly and opened the glass window. Immediately, a refreshing breeze and the chirping of birds filled the air. Jasmine, for a moment, stared blankly at the gradually reddening sky.</p>
<p>She peacefully looked at the sky without any thoughts.</p>
<p>Ironically, she experienced serenity every time her feelings were calm like this. After enduring a big storm the past week, she finally enjoyed a brief peace while gazing at the forest engulfed in twilight.</p>
<p>Now, her mind was clear and sharp, not clouded by complex emotions fluctuating up and down. <em>‘When was the last time I truly felt like myself</em>?’ Jasmine sighed softly and closed the window. The wind, filled with the scent of the forest, quickly disappeared.</p>
<p>Feeling levelheaded, hunger slowly crept up on her. Without hesitation, Jasmine pulled the bell to sound the maid.</p>
<p>“Bring stewed meat pie that’s easy to digest, white bread, apple salad, and potato salad.”</p>
<p>Her appetite exploded, and she filled her mouth with what she wanted to eat. The maid deftly wrote down the menu in her notebook and hesitated before asking,</p>
<p>“Um, should I inform the Duke that you’re awake?”</p>
<p>Seeing Jasmine, who seemed to be in a good mood, the maid quickly clasped her hands.</p>
<p>“The Duke came by an hour ago. He said to let him know when you wake up…”</p>
<p>“Marie.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Are you my maid, the Duke’s maid, or is this the Crown Prince’s villa, and your affiliation naturally changed?”</p>
<p>“No. I misspoke. I apologize, miss.”</p>
<p>Marie bowed neatly as Jasmine rested her chin on her hand and turned her head. The sky was gradually turning violet. The image of purple summer hydrangeas blooming abundantly around the grand mansion of the Grand Duke came to mind.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a sense of longing welled up. Come to think of it, it had been too long since she left home. She was writing a reply, soothing her father’s worries about when she would return, but a day had passed without completing it. Jasmine couldn’t believe her indifference.</p>
<p>How much her father and brothers must have worried for their daughter and sibling who left for a date and hadn’t returned for days. Still, it was fortunate that none of her brothers rushed over immediately.</p>
<p><em>Before that happens, I should write a letter. </em>Jasmine nodded.</p>
<p>She gracefully and neatly devoured everything as soon as the hastily prepared dishes were laid out. Half a day ago, she had no appetite, but seeing her stomach growling like this made her laugh, thinking that maybe her ability to recover wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>After finishing a leisurely meal that lasted about 40 minutes, there was no greater happiness when she tapped her full stomach. Indeed, sleep, warmth, and delicious food were the best for recovering one’s condition.</p>
<p>While devouring the rich chocolate cake, she asked for writing paper, ink, and a pen. She sipped her favorite rose tea and carefully completed a letter to her family.</p>
<p><em>…I am currently staying comfortably and enjoying each day. I will return soon.</em></p>
<p>Biting the end of the quill pen and reading the completed letter, she suddenly burst into a self-deprecating laugh. Living comfortably and joyfully. Well, it wasn’t entirely untrue. She scribbled a passage promising that she would return to her family soon.</p>
<p>Jasmine, who had been deeply immersed in the fleeting dream of love these past few days. felt a strong desire to return.</p>
<p><em>I should go back. To my home. To where I originally belong. I miss my family and friends, my sanctuary. I want to see the people I can trust and rest with.</em></p>
<p>Although it might be selfish to think this way, she couldn’t help it. Her mom used to say that being moderately selfish was necessary for happiness.</p>
<p>She imparted this wisdom: I should be calm and happy first so those around her can be happy. I should take care of myself first to share happiness with others. It’s not true kindness to always give everything to others; it’s anxiety about not wanting to be hated and vanity of wanting to appear perfect to others. Distinguish true love for others from these two.</p>
<p>Jasmine, who had naively nodded then, had become more thoughtful now.</p>
<p><em>What on earth is love? Why is it so complicated, difficult, and painful?</em></p>
<p>Oh, it’s difficult. Initially, she couldn’t stand complicated things. She shook her head, took a small sheet of paper from the drawer, and hesitated awhile. After struggling, holding, and putting down the pen, she eventually dipped it deeply in the ink. The letter, written in cursive, was quickly completed.</p>
