            <p><strong>Chapter 7.1</strong></p>
<p>The mix of intoxication and heightened emotions left her head in turmoil. Unable to utter a word, she stood pale and shaken. The Duke, who stood before her, waited for her to speak.</p>
<p>“Miss Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“What brings you here?”</p>
<p>Both of them simultaneously addressed each other, then fell into a silent staring match.</p>
<p>“I’m here on a friend’s request.”</p>
<p>“Friend? Who…?”</p>
<p>Jasmine wanted to grip her mouth close as she muttered her thoughts without realizing it, ‘Shut up. Shut up! What does it matter to you if he comes with a girl or a girl?’</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Richard calmly replied. “Nysa said she was bored.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Her Highness.”</p>
<p>The two of them were best friends. Jasmine stood blankly when she found the princess in a rose mask surrounded by people not long away.</p>
<p>In truth, her vision was blurred. The effects of the alcohol were intensifying over time. Consequently, as Richard spoke to her, she could barely comprehend his words. He had been speaking to her, looking directly into her eyes, but his words were barely audible.</p>
<p>Amidst her haziness, he stepped closer, and only when he extended his hand right in front of her did she snap back to reality. With a hiccup.</p>
<p>Their gazes met once more, and this time, his striking blue eyes were unusually close. Embarrassment, shame, or perhaps it was due to her intoxication—Jasmine’s cheeks and the back of her neck turned scarlet.</p>
<p>“…You should probably head back.”</p>
<p>“Please allow me the honor of escorting you, my lady.” His voice was velvety, like a weak note from a piano. However, before she could be completely overwhelmed by his aura, danger signals went off.</p>
<p>Startled, Jasmine hurriedly moved back, almost stumbling. Richard instinctively reached out to steady her.</p>
<p>Clenching and unclenching his fist, he looked quite conflicted. In the midst of her annoyance, Jasmine thought, why is he still so impressive and irritatingly cool?</p>
<p>As her lips formed a frown, she sensed a moment of vulnerability from him. His concerned eyes were rather charming. However, in that instant, an alarm in her head rang.</p>
<p><em>He is too close. What if I get my hopes high again?</em></p>
<p>“No, really, I can manage on my own.”</p>
<p>“You’re intoxicated.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p><em>Of course, you appear twice as handsome and dashing!</em> Jasmine cursed internally. But while she pouted, she suddenly straightened up. She wanted to leave as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>“I-I’m not feeling well. I need to go home.”</p>
<p>Rambling on nonsensically, Jasmine abruptly turned and walked away without a word of farewell. Watching her for a moment, Richard furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>What to do? Just as he noticed the curious gazes of a few men fixating on the beautiful woman who clearly displayed signs of inebriation, he promptly followed Jasmine’s path. Even if the hostess, the Countess, tried to mediate, parties like this were often beyond her control.</p>
<p>Even though they might act nonchalant, even though they were anything but ordinary acquaintances, there were faces to maintain and private discussions to uphold.</p>
<p>As Jasmine swayed increasingly due to her intoxication, she nearly stumbled again near a carriage. Unbeknownst to her, it was due to someone’s support that she remained upright. Gazing up through her hazy eyes, she saw Richard sighing wearily.</p>
<p>Precariously holding onto her arm, his mask slipped off, revealing a handsome face.</p>
<p>“Huh? Who are you?” She suddenly blurted out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as Jasmine relaxed after leaving with Richard, her discernment became more impaired as the alcohol continued to affect her.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you our familiar Duke Aion?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Were we close friends?”</p>
<p>She was now quite intoxicated, beyond the point of return.</p>
<p>Jasmine stumbled and pointed a finger, causing Richard’s expression to waver.</p>
<p>“Allow me to escort you home.” He insisted.</p>
<p>After signaling her handmaid and coachman who were close by, Richard stood Jasmine up straight while supporting her frame. She was wobbling and murmuring.</p>
<p>“Oh, I barely had anything to drink. Why is my head pounding like this… And what are you doing in a place like this? You dislike these kinds of events, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>Entertaining the words of drunks was a never-ending task. Having dealt with several drunk individuals, including the Crown Prince and his friend Nysa, Richard wordlessly held Jasmine, who was squirming like a squid, and swiftly guided her towards the carriage.</p>
<p>As the curious stares of those who recognized him intensified, he frowned and wrapped his coat around her to shield her. However, this lack of courtesy annoyed him. Not so much in anger, but rather, he found it amusing.</p>
<p>“Lady Liovanni, please bear with it a little longer. There are many people here.”</p>
<p>“Why? Am I getting in your way by being here? Is that it?”</p>
<p>Richard looked helpless. “It can’t be… It’s not like that.”</p>
<p>“No, really. You looked so disgusted, as if being here was the worst thing ever.”</p>
<p>“It’s not about that…”</p>
<p>“Wow, this is the first time I’ve received such treatment. Have I done something to upset you? Huh? What did I do? When I’m with you, I feel like the most pathetic, annoying, and ugliest person in the world. Do you know that? Do you even care?”</p>
<p>After a while, she hopelessly continued, “…You don’t have any interest in me, so you probably don’t know.”</p>
<p>Engaging in a conversation with a drunk was utterly pointless. Richard knew it, but despite himself, he found himself fumbling for excuses while watching Jasmine vent her frustration. She had an angry and hurt expression, and the strange feeling he experienced prevented him from saying anything.</p>
