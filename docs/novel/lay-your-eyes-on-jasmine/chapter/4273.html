            <h3><strong>Chapter 43.2</strong></h3>
<p>“We just did something more than that a moment ago.” Richard calmly pointed out, and Jasmine burst into laughter again.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true,” she agreed.</p>
<p>However, Richard didn’t join her laughter. Instead, he unexpectedly spoke up. “I feel the same way.”</p>
<p>Looking at the surprised Jasmine, he continued,  “I thought, how did this person live without holding someone’s hand.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“It plagued my mind.”</p>
<p>Jasmine was at a loss for words.  Richard reached out and held her hand again, squeezing her fingers firmly. It felt as unyielding and resilient as handcuffs.</p>
<p>“During the summer vacation, they light up the glass garden where roses bloom at night. The view is quite beautiful, and it might lift your spirits. Would you like to go?” he asked.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Jasmine?” Richard, who had been mentally mapping the route of their walk, turned to her and lost his words.</p>
<p><em>Why… Why do you look at me like that?</em></p>
<p>When Richard saw Jasmine’s distorted expression, as if she might burst into tears, he felt a sting in his chest, as though he had been pricked with thorns. The tear-filled gaze, so painful and resentful, was something he had never seen before despite witnessing various aspects of her, like anger, laughter, teasing, irritation, and even drinking. It was the first time her eyes held so much pain, and it made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He almost wished she would get angry or irritated instead.</p>
<p><em>What did I do wrong? Why are you crying? Are you in pain? Did I make a mistake by not giving you time to rest and blindly agreeing to come along when you haven’t fully recovered?</em></p>
<p>For a moment, nothing else could occupy his thoughts.</p>
<p>Richard’s mind froze, and he promptly dropped to one knee in front of Jasmine, cupping her gloomy, sad face. No tears had fallen yet, but he could sense she was crying. His heart sank once again, and he pursed his lips. Da!mn, she must be upset.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>He felt dying, wanting to know what she was thinking. This had been going on since he got the dreaded congratulations. <em>Why is Jasmine hurting? Is it because of me? I think it’s because of me. </em>He suddenly remembered Jasmine’s tearful words the other day.</p>
<p>“Sir Richard Aion, the truth is, there’s nothing else in my bright, sunny life worth caring about but you, and I hope you realize that.”</p>
<p>The tone was playful, but it was spoken with truth. Richard had unintentionally hurt her before.</p>
<p>Strangely, he’d never felt inadequate or lacking anywhere, but in front of Jasmine, he always felt like he’d come up short somewhere. He made more mistakes, became more impatient, and more emotional.</p>
<p><em>I can do better, </em>he thought. <em>I have to be better. Why is it always… </em>This time he truly had no idea.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, do you hate roses?”</p>
<p>He was already talking crap. It’s probably the dumbest thing he’d ever said in his entire life.</p>
<p>As he cursed under his breath, Jasmine’s brow furrowed as if she were going to cry at his unintentional joke. Ha, a weak sigh and a sob. Jasmine’s hazy violet eyes suddenly became clear as she stared into space. Then they dropped to Richard’s face, staring at him intently.</p>
<p>“Richard.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Speak.”</p>
<p>Like a knight awaiting his queen’s command, Richard answered. After fiddling with his hand momentarily, Jasmine asked softly but clearly.</p>
<p>“What do you think of me?”</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>For a moment, Richard was more puzzled than embarrassed. It was a question he hadn’t expected to be asked in this situation.</p>
<p>It was also absurd. It was like a flower on a branch asking a tree what it thought of it. He didn’t have time to think of an answer, so when he narrowed his eyes, Jasmine asked again.</p>
<p>“I’m asking you what I am to you and what that means. You said you like me. How much do you like me, exactly?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re asking.”</p>
<p>This one was sincere. Richard felt his good brain stop functioning—or maybe it was overloaded. Either way, it was useless. So he blurted out the first thing that came to mind.</p>
<p>“I like Jasmine….”</p>
<p>Of course, he loved her. He wanted to see her, hold her, over and over again. He assumed Jasmine felt the same way since she seemed to enjoy being around him all the time—except today.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to say more but was frozen by Jasmine’s cold, assessing eyes. She was so eerily calm and serious.</p>
<p>It was the most elegant, ‘aristocratic’ side of her that Richard had ever seen. Perhaps it was Jasmine’s true face, for she had always met Richard with a poised facade, but not tonight.</p>
<p>“Although I need the Grand Duchy Liovanni, it’s not urgent enough for me to risk your life. If you end up like His Majesty and your mother, how can you look at your late uncle?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The words unmistakably echoed in the study came out of Jasmine’s lips. Richard’s eyes widened in shock. As she scrutinized his face, her lips curled up.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that right?”</p>
