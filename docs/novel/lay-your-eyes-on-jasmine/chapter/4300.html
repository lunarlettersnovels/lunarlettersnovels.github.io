            <p><strong>Chapter 30.1</strong></p>
<p>When Richard saw her slim and enticing thighs, her slender neck underneath the pony tail tied with a ribbon, he unconsciously caused the reins to slacken as though pulled by an invisible force.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Richard found himself again surprised by Jasmine’s beauty. It was as if he had known it all along. Even when she hid among the crowd, she always sparkled alone.</p>
<p>However, much to his disappointment, he wasn’t the only one to recognize her beauty. Richard’s eyebrows furrowed as he keenly sensed the gazes of other men ogling her.</p>
<p>He found their hyena-like postures, aiming for their prey, deeply irritating. After all, it hadn’t been long since that Charles guy or whatever had met her.</p>
<p>Considering that a woman who had never shown any interest in that sort of thing started dating a member of the opposite s3x, the males must have sensed it, like a ghost.  As a man, there was no way he didn’t understand how their minds worked.</p>
<p>However, Jasmine remained oblivious, chatting away with a bright smile. Did she have any idea how other people see her? He wondered.</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed at the delicate flower with a sweet scent from a distance.</p>
<p>Already, her fragrance filled the air. Their eyes met. When she licked her lips as if thirsty, her face immediately turned red, and she looked away.</p>
<p>Isn’t she adorable? Jasmine tried to stay composed. She didn’t know that her entire body would turn red when he sucked the mole beneath her ear. Or her blush would become deeper when she bit her lips.</p>
<p><em>Ha.. so pretty.</em> He was in trouble.</p>
<p>Richard lamented that it would be challenging to control himself today.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In truth, Jasmine wasn’t without her thoughts.</p>
<p>She was overthinking things, so she tried to focus on the reality of the moment.</p>
<p><em>‘Honestly, isn’t it hard not to think about anything?’</em></p>
<p>Through a twist of fate, she had ended up sleeping with her longtime crush, and yes, she had even gotten drunk and caused a scene. But it had been nice. It seemed he liked it too.</p>
<p>Well, he liked it more than that. Richard was also wholeheartedly immersed in their relationship, and Jasmine instinctively knew it.</p>
<p>His once cold demeanor had melted away, and now he tenderly kissed her lips and even playfully tickled her toes. Undoubtedly, he leaned towards the ‘liking’ side of the scale. Add to that their passionate and fiery intimacy. His bedroom manners were impeccable.</p>
<p>Jasmine hadn’t lifted a finger every time they made love. Washing her was instinctive (although there were many times when she had to do it more). He held Jasmine in his arms as she dozed off. He even dried her hair.</p>
<p>It was as if she had turned into a delicate flower or a beloved doll that he had to care for meticulously. If she wanted to drink water or snacks, he fed her and didn’t let her leave the bed. He held her in his arms, carrying her to the table for a late brunch when she wanted to wear his shirt and join him.</p>
<p>As he effortlessly carried her like a doll, Jasmine wondered if she was light.</p>
<p>To be honest, it was lovely. Even in just a few days, Richard had grown fonder of her to the point where Jasmine seriously worried about it.</p>
<p>Was it natural that they made love, said sweet nothings, fell asleep, and woke up in each other’s arms every day? She likes him a lot. Perhaps even <em>a lot</em> more after they had s3x.</p>
<p>That’s what left her worrying.</p>
<p>It was clear that Richard liked her enough to maintain their relationship.  But what about it? Did Richard <em>truly </em>like her as much as she did?</p>
<p>She was skeptical. Naturally, there was something like a ‘physiological response,’ and she could tell that Richard had started to see her differently than before…</p>
<p>She couldn’t grasp why she wasn’t comfortable. Why wasn’t her heart feeling as full as she had imagined? It was strange.</p>
<p>They met all the prerequisites for a happy fairytale ending, but she wasn’t feeling as fulfilled as she had anticipated. What was it, she wondered. Jasmine examined her feelings.</p>
<p>In the meantime, she couldn’t help but think that s3x felt incredibly good.</p>
<p>She heard that some people have been in unrequited love for a long time, and then it cools off once it comes true. <em>‘Is that me?’</em></p>
<p>But she didn’t think this was the case.</p>
<p>When Richard grinned and stretched out his hand, her heart started pounding, and she wanted to become one with him as soon as possible. She wanted to share secrets and have him tenderly stroke her head. She even enjoyed the playful hand gestures and the silly chit-chat, making her float on a cloud of happiness.</p>
<p>And when she was all alone, without him by her side, something felt missing.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why she became more absorbed in their lovemaking. Because she wanted to quickly erase that momentary feeling of emptiness or because she wanted to feel that sweet ecstasy again.</p>
