            <p><strong>Chapter 10.2</strong></p>
<p>Shouldering the responsibilities of his lineage at a younger age than expected was burdensome, but he managed reasonably well and gradually improved. He believed he was doing well, and without the discernment and rationality that had supported him, it would have been much more challenging.</p>
<p>Yet lately, doubts began to creep in. Were his values and ways of thinking always correct? While his prowess had been a formidable support on both the battlefield and in politics, it often caused friction in personal matters. People sought a more human connection with him, and when he responded in his characteristic manner, they ended up hurt, disappointed, or feeling slighted.</p>
<p>Their feelings were not unfounded. Richard never felt the need to unnecessarily keep people close to him. He rarely paid attention to their reactions, and any sense of it being bothersome or tedious was usually fleeting.</p>
<p>However, this time was truly an exceptional case. How often did someone he had met only a few times make him reflect on himself?</p>
<p>Richard furrowed his brow and then slowly relaxed it. He couldn’t help but let out a wry chuckle. Just like vivid colors from an intense paint splatter spreading onto his clothes, the more he got involved with her, the more various shades, different from his usual self, emerged.</p>
<p>At first, it was guilt. The second time, it was anger.</p>
<p>As for the third time, well, who knew what that would bring.</p>
<p><em>—-</em></p>
<p>As Jasmine shredded her tenth newspaper, the members of the ducal family observed her youngest member in silence. For three days, she had been tearing newspapers into pieces with a vacant expression.</p>
<p>Since the failed private conversation, the family’s mood had soured. However, it was more a melancholic atmosphere than the explosive anger they were witnessing from their youngest member.</p>
<p>The family members sensed that something unusual had happened to her. This moment occurred just after their return from a masquerade, their clothes carrying the scent of alcohol. Jasmine, who consistently adhered to curfew, was the reason why everyone, from the Duke to the Duchess and even the Duke’s son, had eagerly waited.</p>
<p>Yet, as soon as the carriage bearing the youngest arrived, and before they could reprimand her for being late, Jasmine’s expressionless face turned toward them, silencing them.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. There won’t be any more incidents like this in the future.”</p>
<p>With that, she straightened her previously tense posture, walked with an unnatural grace, and returned to her room. The Duke, briefly overwhelmed by the cold aura she exuded, belatedly followed his youngest son, questioning him intently. However, he, too, was clueless.</p>
<p>What on earth could have provoked their youngest to such anger?</p>
<p>“Um, Jasmine. How about we go shopping today? You do like Madame Serene’s collection. Coincidentally, today…”</p>
<p>Rip…</p>
<p>The morning edition of the Imperial Newspaper was torn vertically. James, who had been reading it attentively, winced as he saw his face with a cheerful smile in the morning edition torn in half.</p>
<p>It was a newspaper article that read, “James, the Deputy Minister of Economy, successfully completed the agreement with Artina…” But somehow, it felt like it was his cheek that had been torn apart.</p>
<p>“Darling, why are you tearing the newspapers like that? Is something bothering you…?”</p>
<p>Meeting Jasmine’s uninterested gaze, the Duke quickly changed his approach.</p>
<p>“It seems like tearing up newspapers isn’t enough. Should I request more from the printing press? Or perhaps I should contact the palace’s incinerator. Since there’s plenty of waste, we might as well recycle it.”</p>
<p>Caras, a journalist oblivious to resource concerns, chattered nonsense beside his father. Jasmine neither confirmed nor denied anything. However, the capable steward of the ducal family had already brought a fresh stack of newspapers and placed them beside her.</p>
<p>Under the slightly anxious looks of the three men, Jasmine mechanically reached for the next newspaper and, by chance, spotted a magazine nestled among them. It was a very small portion of the cover, but what was that bluish stain-like thing?</p>
<p>With just a glance the size of a fingernail, Jasmine recognized it naturally. Initially embarrassed, then expressionless, and eventually, a sequence of teasing and bewilderment emerged in her eyes.</p>
<p>Despite knowing it was foolish, Jasmine pulled out the magazine, and as the handsome man’s face on the magazine became visible, everyone in the room involuntarily held their breath.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, it was a gossip magazine featuring Duke Aion.</p>
<p>As if they’d discovered a massive bomb in a ceasefire zone, the Duke’s family exchanged urgent glances.</p>
<p>“What the hell! Who brought that kind of thing into this house?”</p>
<p>“Why on earth would a man who’s a <em>darn</em> duke have an article in a magazine like this?”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t that kid have any rights to his image? How infuriating!”</p>
<p>Engaging in pointless criticism, they all turned to gauge Jasmine’s reaction, which had become even quieter than before. Gradually, as she raised it, a sense of fear spread among them, fearing that Jasmine might hold it close and burst into tears.</p>
<p>Her overwhelming emotions, too complex to be expressed on her face, seemed on the verge of spilling over onto others. Just as they were about to reach out to her, not knowing what to do with their sympathy…</p>
<p>Jasmine picked up a fork, deftly spun it in a circle, and then expertly stabbed it straight through. The eyes of Duke Aion.</p>
<p>At her bold action, the three Liovannis froze, their mouths hanging open. Without hesitation, she gleefully destroyed the image of the Duke’s face, then picked it up and elegantly instructed the only composed person in the room, the steward, with a lively expression.</p>
<p>“Dispose of it.”</p>
<p>Or even better…</p>
<p>“Burn it.”</p>
<p>It was the freshest expression they had seen on her face in days.</p>
