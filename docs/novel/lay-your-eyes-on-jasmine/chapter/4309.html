            <h3><strong>Chapter 25.2</strong></h3>
<p>Jasmine’s heart raced. So she responded playfully on purpose, but Richard replied earnestly.</p>
<p>“I mean it.”</p>
<p><em>Seriously. Don’t seduce me.</em></p>
<p>“I sometimes feel like it’s a waste that someone like you is fond of me.”</p>
<p>Jasmine chuckled softly at his words, so full of sincerity. He must have spoken with genuine goodwill, but… as he lowered his gaze as their lips met, a complicated mix of emotions churned inside her. She tried to push those thoughts away.</p>
<p>For now, she didn’t want to overthink things because everything felt so good.  She didn’t want to get too serious. Right now, it was just…</p>
<p>“Shall we freshen up together? Are you hungry?”</p>
<p>Richard whispered with a mischievous smile. Jasmine nodded. While the intimacy had been enjoyable, it had also been tiring. She craved toast with sweet maple syrup, eggs, crispy bacon, and creamy stew. Something sweet and savory.</p>
<p>Richard kissed her lips again and lifted her, heading towards the bathroom. She let out a playful scream and wrapped her arms around Richard’s neck. Richard’s mischievous laughter was a delightful sound to her ears.</p>
<p>Jasmine didn’t resist the playful teasing. She was quite taken with Richard and his smile that naturally curved up at the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The sweet and suggestive invitation to wash together didn’t end merely as a figure of speech. They did wash together and did it again from there. She didn’t realize it then, but it all felt so natural.</p>
<p>Jasmine reflected on the past few days, wondering if she was being too obvious. Otherwise, this seems too much.</p>
<p>And the fact that these thoughts only occurred to her three days later was also surprising. My friends had not long ago teased her as the “flower of high society” who looks at men like a rock or as the ascetic princess. But it seems that wasn’t the case anymore…</p>
<p>It’s been three days since that night, and Jasmine decided to accept the invitation of the prince to enjoy an extended vacation and stay at the villa. Of course, Lord Aion was with them.</p>
<p>They appeared composed on the surface, attending the prince’s banquets, riding horses, and participating in tea parties and hunts with serene expressions as if they hadn’t done anything naughty.</p>
<p>And at other times, the two of them spent each day swept away by passion, like unbridled horses.</p>
<p>They didn’t plan for any of that to happen. It just happened by chance when their eyes met or their hands overlapped to reach for the pepper shaker, and in situations like that, especially when they were alone, the next steps were quite obvious.</p>
<p>When Richard, with a longing gaze, licked his lips after a meal, Jasmine, her throat dry, would pounce on him. Or when Jasmine blushed while swallowing a sip of wine, Richard, with a stoic face, would urgently rush to her.</p>
<p>Like throwing sparks into constantly boiling oil, they ignited instantly.</p>
<p>Both of them passionately desired each other, their desires burning as intensely as the other’s, and they quickly forgot the awkwardness and mystery that had lingered just a few days ago, as well as the arguments from a month before.</p>
<p>Once they began, it was hard to compose themselves. They were perfectly matched in bed.</p>
<p>Jasmine, who had initially opened her eyes to this, seemed to become increasingly natural as time passed, and Richard, utterly captivated, kissed and explored every inch of her body.</p>
<p>Fortunately or unfortunately, they were both strong and vigorous. Once they ignited, neither of them could bring themselves to stop.</p>
<p>Even Richard, who was energetic like a young stallion, tried to control himself as an older man and a more experienced one. Still, he always forgot that resolve with Jasmine’s mischievous smile, and Jasmine, after vowing, “Let’s talk after we finish because it’s urgent,” always ended up enjoying their passionate moments and falling asleep, so it was all in vain.</p>
<p>And because they had to occasionally show their faces at gatherings with the Crown Prince and nobility (it was very noticeable when either was absent), they didn’t have much time to share deep conversations alone.</p>
<p>Was this okay? The thought crossed her mind on a late brunch after three days that had passed like wildfire.</p>
<p>Last night, they had stayed up until the early morning hours, waking up and repeating the cycle, mating and indulging in each other. They were a little tired, but they felt incredibly good. They couldn’t feel more fulfilled as they lay naked in each other’s arms.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it felt even more comfortable than in her father’s embrace. Like branches from different trees merging into one, they found satisfaction in holding each other and engaging in small talk.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, despite being born and raised in different aristocratic families, they had many overlapping conversation topics, patterns, and interests. It was as if, despite being completely different, something was connecting them.</p>
<p>They loved horseback riding and polo, had a deep appreciation for art and music, and, above all, they loved being active.</p>
<p>Of course, Jasmine’s seven-year project to become a perfect lady had contributed to this, but among all those refinements, what had truly elevated her to an exceptional level was that she genuinely enjoyed these things and had a talent for them.</p>
