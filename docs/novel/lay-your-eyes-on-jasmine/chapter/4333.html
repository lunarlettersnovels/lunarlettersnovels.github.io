            <p><strong>Chapter 13.2</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine had little interest in alcohol and was politically neutral, being from the Liovanni Ducal family, which remained neutral regarding power. Apart from well-known information about the royal family, she wasn’t particularly knowledgeable about the aristocracy. She simply wasn’t that interested.</p>
<p>She knew that Richard was the cousin trusted by Prince Jilian, the next heir to the throne, and the only relative of the imperial family. That’s when she first became interested in the imperial family.</p>
<p>The Emperor, who had only daughters one after another, had a deep fondness for Richard, who was quiet and reliable compared to his imposing daughters. Despite Duke Aion holding the position of the Emperor’s first sword, Richard, as the Emperor’s adopted son, was, in some sense, almost like a son to the current Emperor.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Duke and the royal family, especially the future leader of the Emperor’s faction, shared an inseparable relationship. They were so close that you could almost consider them childhood friends because they were always together, and one of them happened to be Princess Naisa.</p>
<p>The sudden recollection of this name complicated Jasmine’s feelings. She had almost forgotten about it, but it came rushing back, causing her inner turmoil.</p>
<p>She had nearly forgotten about him, and that’s how she preferred it. Yet, when she thought about it, she realized he seemed to go out of his way to avoid her as if stepping around mud…</p>
<p>It made her feel downcast and somewhat irritated, even though she had no desire to see him.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why. Her life had been straightforward, clean, and refreshing, and there had never been such complicated interactions before, so this was no different.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, Jasmine pursed her lips and glanced out the window at the passing scenery.</p>
<p>‘<em>Humph, you’ll grow into an old man, swinging a sword and reading documents all your life!’</em></p>
<p>Let someone else handle the responsibilities, preferably Richard. Let him handle the girl, whether it’s Lily or a dandelion or whatever. Why should it be her problem? She clenched her fists and exhaled softly.</p>
<p>Jasmine was certain that Richard Aion would eventually regret his decisions.</p>
<p>She clenched her fists tighter and let out a frustrated sigh. For a while, maybe half a year, or even a whole year, it would be great if they didn’t have to see each other.</p>
<p>…But things took a different turn. How did it come to this?</p>
<p>Jasmine avoided eye contact as she felt Richard’s intense gaze upon her. They were currently at the party venue, and Jasmine had never imagined meeting him here, especially not outside the capital. How had she ended up here with that pest…</p>
<p>“Today, the wine tastes surprisingly good. Lady Liovanni, do you enjoy wine as well?”</p>
<p>A cool and composed beauty with an icy demeanor, surrounded by flattery from the nobles in the center of the party hall, approached while lightly tapping his fan.</p>
<p>With each step he took, a commotion rippled through the crowd, parting like the sea. Even the charming Jasmine, a society’s flower, was sweating nervously, stumbling over her words as she responded.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t…”</p>
<p>“If you require assistance, I can help.”</p>
<p>As part of the Liovanni dukedom, Jasmine had to be cautious with her words. While she was carefully thinking of what to say, Richard somehow managed to interject before she could respond.</p>
<p>Since both men in front of Jasmine were blood-related, it wasn’t considered impolite. With his jet-black hair, resembling Sycamore wood and eyes as bright as the emperor’s, the crown prince raised an eyebrow and smiled slyly. His sharp gaze shifted between Duke Aion, who appeared indifferent to everything, and the flustered Jasmine.</p>
<p>“Oh, come to think of it, have you two met before?” The crown prince asked.</p>
<p>“More like acquaintances,” Jasmine replied.</p>
<p>“Jasmine’s older brother, James, is Richard’s senior at the academy. I have often sought his guidance,” the duke interrupted.</p>
<p>Jasmine stared blankly at the back of his head, wondering why he kept doing this. Who was he helping or comforting?</p>
<p>“Oh, is that so?”</p>
<p>The Crown Prince, Jilian, exchanged a glance with Jasmine, who had turned bright red for a moment and seemed taken aback. He chuckled and waved his fan playfully.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard rumors that there were matchmaking discussions between you two. You talk as if you’re not particularly close.”</p>
<p>Jilian was known for his straightforwardness. Jasmine gasped and, for a brief moment, made eye contact with Richard, who responded calmly as always.</p>
<p>“It’s just that I’m not good enough for Lady Liovanni.”</p>
<p>“Richard.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Are you her lawyer?” When Richard closed his mouth, Jilian added nonchalantly, “Anyone would think you’re engaged.”</p>
<p>Though Jilian didn’t pay much attention to high society, his words carried weight as he was the Crown Prince. All eyes were now on Richard, whose brow had furrowed slightly.</p>
<p>He knew his cousin well. He was deliberately mischievous and intentional in his actions. His slender eyes, which he raised while tilting his head, revealed a mischievous glint.</p>
<p>“Ah, is that so? My Lady, surely you didn’t feel offended?”</p>
<p>“How could that be, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Although his words seemed apologetic, his cheerful tone hinted that he wouldn’t take offense at something like this.</p>
<p>Jasmine just sighed. Her eyes moved away from the distant corner and fixed on Charles, who was endlessly staring at her. With a Duke and even the Crown Prince of this country present, the son of a Viscount with no special rank couldn’t make a move.</p>
<p><em>How did this happen…</em></p>
