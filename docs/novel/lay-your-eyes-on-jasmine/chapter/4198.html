            <p><strong>Chapter 81.1</strong></p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“Jasmine?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>At her friends’ curious looks, Jasmine flinched and lifted her head. Nikki, sitting next to her, muttered.</p>
<p>“I’ve been calling you for a while. What are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>“Uh, nothing. Just… nothing important.”</p>
<p>Jasmine awkwardly waved her hand and laughed. Lichang, who was sipping a cocktail, observed her carefully. With a crooked smile, she changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Anyway, it must be fall because I feel a chill in my bones. It’s the season that makes you think of old flames.”</p>
<p>“Old flames or potential new ones?”</p>
<p>Aisha mumbled through a mouthful of ice cream, then quickly looked away toward the blueberry pie when Lichang met her eyes. Jasmine smiled softly, but she didn’t look very lively.</p>
<p>“By the way, what’s up with Marian? How is she these days?”</p>
<p>“How do you think? She’s been chomping on cucumbers like a stressed-out rabbit.”</p>
<p>“She has the temperament of a predator but eats veggies when she’s mad.”</p>
<p>“She switched to carrots yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Is she actually becoming a rabbit?”</p>
<p>When Lichang muttered seriously, Nikki burst into laughter. Jasmine also smiled a little. Marian did look a bit like a rabbit.</p>
<p>“Has her husband done anything about her being gone for days?”</p>
<p>“He did come looking for her.”</p>
<p>“Wow, what did he say?”</p>
<p>“He demanded she come back immediately, insisting he didn’t do anything wrong.”</p>
<p>Jasmine answered indifferently, adding more syrup to her drink. Soyer certainly didn’t seem like a carefree playboy when she saw him yesterday; he looked more like a young man lost in an unexpected crisis. Acting like he’s going through puberty despite being a father, what’s that about?</p>
<p>“Maybe he didn’t do it, but it’s still suspicious. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“You need to catch him in the act.”</p>
<p>Lichang suggested with a smirk. Jasmine sighed. But would that really be a good thing? She poked at her fruit with a fork, silent for a moment, before suddenly speaking up.</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s right to meet up again with someone who’s already out of your life?”</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes lit up with interest. It was a topic worth pondering seriously. Lichang took a sip of her sangria and made a short sound.</p>
<p>“That’s a tough question.”</p>
<p>“Something’s tough for you?”</p>
<p>Jasmine asked in surprise. Lichang snorted.</p>
<p>“What do you take me for? Emotional issues are tough for anyone unless you’re a god.”</p>
<p>“Is that so…”</p>
<p>“But it’s also a simple problem. My conclusion is straightforward.”</p>
<p>She looked at the fast-flowing river with hazy eyes, her profile somehow sentimental. But her next words were firm.</p>
<p>“The past is the past. There’s no need to cling to something that’s already over.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>Jasmine chuckled softly. But there was another opinion.</p>
<p>“But there are couples who break up and get back together if they’re truly meant to be. They can form a stronger, better relationship based on their past. Sure, most people break up again for the same reasons, but not everyone. They grow and change together. Isn’t that what a destined partner is?”</p>
<p>Aisha, true to her artistic nature, championed romanticism. Nikki chimed in.</p>
<p>“Everyone says they’ll change, but how can you be sure the other person is really your destined partner?”</p>
<p>“How could you not know?”</p>
<p>Aisha wagged her finger.</p>
<p>“If they have a good face and body, don’t cheat, and are good in bed, they’re your destined partner.”</p>
<p>Everyone laughed at the cheeky joke and shook their heads. Lichang smirked lazily.</p>
<p>“Destiny sure is practical.”</p>
<p>“No, seriously. Most people regret getting back together. They cry, fight, and break up again for the same reasons. So why do they try again?”</p>
<p>“Is that a real question? It’s because they still have lingering feelings. Remember when you got back with that red-haired guy?”</p>
<p>“Hey! That was ages ago. We were students. We didn’t know any better.”</p>
<p>Nikki mumbled, turning red. Everyone pretended not to notice, knowing her embarrassing history.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t seem like breaking up once means it’s over forever. A few couples do end up getting married. Like Marian. Oh… maybe she’s not the best example right now.”</p>
<p>“What about me?”</p>
<p>“Oh my god!”</p>
<p>Aisha nearly jumped out of her seat as the blue-haired beauty suddenly sat next to her. Jasmine greeted Marian, who was already looking at the menu.</p>
<p>“Finished already?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. They all say the same thing: get evidence.”</p>
<p>Marian rested her chin on her hand, lazily choosing from the menu before pressing the bell. As they waited for her to order, Lichang asked.</p>
<p>“So, are you in a potential separation phase?”</p>
<p>“Stuck, really.”</p>
<p>At her friends’ urging, Marian had consulted the best divorce lawyers in the capital. Their wisdom, drawn from various experiences, aimed to prepare her for any situation.</p>
<p>After listening to her case, they suggested infidelity was possible but recommended having a serious conversation with her husband first. Marian snorted.</p>
