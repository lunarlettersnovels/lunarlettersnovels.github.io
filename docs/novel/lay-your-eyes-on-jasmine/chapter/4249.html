            <p><strong>Chapter 55.2</strong></p>
<p>Slowly, deeply. Jasmine wanted to be careful and do her best. As someone who had experienced disappointment many times, just maintaining and enjoying this happiness was heavy and sufficient for Jasmine.</p>
<p>But Richard wasn’t like that. She liked how he lu!sted after her, demanded her, and desired her so intensely. But sometimes, his impatience and desires that came out like rage felt suffocating.</p>
<p>Beyond the hardships, what frightened her the most was the uncertain future of their relationship, suddenly crumbling apart.</p>
<p>Anything too hot cools down quickly. That was the difference between a big fire and an ember.</p>
<p>But Richard didn’t understand her caution.</p>
<p>Why didn’t Jasmine understand that he tried to accommodate and listen in his way? Despite his lack of understanding or empathy towards her, he nodded to please her and keep her by his side.</p>
<p>His lack of understanding felt like a temporary constraint to their relationship that couldn’t be helped. But even so, that was enough.</p>
<p>Since he made an effort.</p>
<p>She was touched and grateful for the conversation, the change, and how willingly he listened, even if it was a bit different from what she wanted.</p>
<p>But he became strangely unfamiliar when she overheard their conversation and realized that the picture he was painting was different from hers and that he didn’t discuss the most important thing with her.</p>
<p>‘Does this person love and respect me for who I am? Or does he merely want to have me?’</p>
<p>Things might not have escalated this far if Jasmine hadn’t known Richard.</p>
<p>Richard Aion was unusually straightforward, but he had an eccentric side that sometimes became persistent when he was wrong. She, too, was vaguely aware of it.</p>
<p>By observing the changes in his tone and behavior, she noticed that, while usually calm like a quiet lake, he occasionally displayed a relentless obsession, which typically manifested in his work-related pursuits or achievements.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Jasmine found him quite impressive for being passionate only in his field without excessive attachment to people—a workaholic, indeed.</p>
<p>This made her think that the accomplishments of a man like Richard Aion weren’t just the result of ordinary effort.</p>
<p>However, it would be a separate issue if such an ‘achievement-oriented’ obsession were directed at her.</p>
<p>She was a person, not a goal or objective.</p>
<p>Moreover, she loved him very much. She just wanted a simple relationship, to be like any ordinary couple. To share meals, laugh at trivial things, and spend time together, intertwining their lives.</p>
<p>But in the face of his desires and declarations of affection, her love sometimes felt squeezed and swallowed.</p>
<p>Honestly, she didn’t completely dislike it. Wasn’t it fine as it is?</p>
<p>As he said, since they both wanted each other and all conditions were favorable, was there a need to create unnecessary disturbances?</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but feel tempted by such thoughts.</p>
<p>But how long will his ‘liking’ last? Love isn’t eternal. What happens to her when his goal is achieved—when his greed is satisfied?</p>
<p>Since he has already been treating her so indulgently according to his liking, she became addicted to that affection.</p>
<p>But what happens if he suddenly becomes indifferent one day? Will her soul be impoverished because his desires and achievements are more significant and solid than love?</p>
<p>‘I’d rather it be a lifelong thing. Then, even if you don’t love me… I might willingly become your trophy.’</p>
<p>Jasmine sighed as she curled up like a child. A self-deprecating smile crept up on her tear-stained eyes.</p>
<p>“I must be really stubborn.”</p>
<p>Maybe this love is madness.</p>
<p>Perhaps ending it here would be best.</p>
<p>For both you and me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the morning of May 1874 in the Continental Year, a sudden urgent news arrived at dawn in the quiet capital.</p>
<p>An armed conflict between the Empire and Jiosen erupted.</p>
<p>Even though it was expected, it could not be denied that it was a sudden dispute.</p>
<p>Enraged, Emperor Arzanta dispatched a large army of warships and knights, with Crown Prince Jilian as Commander-in-Chief and Richard Aion, the Ironblood Duke, as his Second-in-Command.</p>
<p>The Crown Prince and Duke, traveling to the capital, were forced to turn their horses and head for the battlefield.</p>
<p>The suddenness of the battle meant that there was no ceremony.</p>
<p>The dignitaries chattered about when this war would end, discussing the future confrontation between the two great powers. The general consensus was that it would be over within a year, now that the Emperor had sent his heir, the Crown Prince, and the Emperor’s sword into battle.</p>
<p>Jasmine heard this news while she was idly plucking roses in the garden.</p>
<p>Half a year had passed since their early summer parting.</p>
