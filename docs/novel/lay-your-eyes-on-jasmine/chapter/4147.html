            <p><strong>Chapter 107.1</strong></p>
<p>Why was I so awful back then? As Richard’s face grew gloomy, Jasmine hesitantly observed his depressed demeanor.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to be sarcastic. Well, honestly, it’s true though.”</p>
<p>“Even if it’s true, bargaining with someone’s feelings is nothing more or less than cheap.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, you’re quite harsh.”</p>
<p>Feeling unnecessarily apologetic, Jasmine scratched her cheek.</p>
<p>While she had no intention whatsoever of being led along by his wishes like her past mistake, she didn’t want to dwell too much on past events, considering they were both trying to make a fresh start.</p>
<p>It bothered her when he was depressed like this. But actively consoling him seemed too much. This wasn’t even playing hard to get, so what was it?</p>
<p>Huh? Jasmine blinked.</p>
<p>Is what I’m doing now that famous push and pull? No way? Or is it?</p>
<p>With her thoughts becoming complicated, Jasmine shook her head to clear the air.</p>
<p>“Yesterday was a bit sudden due to the situation. I’m sorry if my family made you uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“No. You had every right to act that way, absolutely.”</p>
<p>Richard said firmly.</p>
<p>“Rather, I should be the one apologizing. Especially to Jasmine’s parents.”</p>
<p>“Personally, you might be annoying, but strictly speaking, haven’t you done nothing wrong?”</p>
<p>Men and women can date, fight, and break up. As for unrequited love, while she might have regrets, it was her feelings alone – it would be unfair to blame him for that.</p>
<p>Though contradictory even to herself, it was certainly true. Seeing Jasmine’s detached attitude, Richard shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, if Jasmine were my daughter, I wouldn’t want to give her to someone like me either.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘someone like me’?”</p>
<p>“A selfish man with too much pride and greed.”</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>Though harsh, some parts were admittedly true. Noticing her reaction, Richard chuckled.</p>
<p>“Does Jasmine feel the same?”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“Do you think you’re too good for someone like me?”</p>
<p>It seems so. And rightfully so.</p>
<p>Staring at Richard’s bitter smile, Jasmine absently stroked her hair.</p>
<p>“Weren’t you angry yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“You seemed beside yourself with anger.”</p>
<p>Yesterday, Richard had held onto Jasmine’s hand continuously when she came out to see him off.</p>
<p>As if reluctant to part, as if unwilling to let go. Even when his carriage arrived, he kept fidgeting with her small hand until the end, as if still wanting to stay.</p>
<p>When their eyes met then, Jasmine was almost afraid he might suddenly pull her into the carriage. It was partly because those blue eyes still hadn’t completely settled from the emotions stirred by her bold provocation.</p>
<p>Richard responded gently to her subtle probe.</p>
<p>“What right do I have to be angry? I’m not even your lover.”</p>
<p>He’s still angry. Jasmine muttered internally.</p>
<p>“But I’m sincere about following your wishes. As a suitor, I’m in no position to be picky. That’s what being in the weaker position means, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“So I’m in the stronger position?”</p>
<p>When she asked while resting her chin on her hand with interest, Richard smiled with tilted eyes.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you know? I’ve been in the weaker position with you for quite a while.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. I wonder why that was.”</p>
<p>Jasmine answered lightly in jest.</p>
<p>“Maybe you’ve just gotten too used to being in the weaker position.”</p>
<p>Have you had breakfast? Would you like to eat? When Jasmine offered, Richard nodded slowly after a slight pause. He remained quiet throughout most of the meal. Then, as she was rinsing her mouth with water, he put down his utensils and spoke.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about why you were so sharp with me yesterday.”</p>
<p>Jasmine watched him intently without rushing him. After contemplating deeply while staring at the glass vase decorated with pink roses, he said,</p>
<p>“I’ve reconsidered everything you said. Every single thing.”</p>
<p>Richard’s blue eyes focused entirely on her, like newly risen stars.</p>
<p>“So my conclusion was that in your eyes, I must seem quite inadequate.”</p>
<p>Jasmine remained silent.</p>
<p>“To you, who has struggled alone for so long, my sincerity must have seemed unreliable. You might have found me annoying too. You might have disliked how I spoke of love in front of your family when nothing has been decided yet. While it was just honest expression for me, from your perspective, it might have felt like being manipulated again. Unlike me, you’re kind-hearted, so you can’t help but care about sincerity. To be frank, I’m not like that.”</p>
<p>Just as you pointed out, pretense has become a habit. I suppose I’ve been pretending most of the time.’</p>
<p>“So, I thought you might feel it’s a waste to give yourself to someone like me.”</p>
<p>“Then what?”</p>
<p>“I’m glad.”</p>
<p>When Jasmine looked at him with puzzled eyes, Richard smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“It means you value yourself more than anyone else. I like that you take care of and cherish yourself, Jasmine. And you’ve always been that kind of person.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“So, I’m not angry now. Is that an answer to your question?”</p>
<p>It was his response to her earlier inquiry about whether he was still angry. Jasmine gazed down at the back of her white hand, her eyes cast downward. Whenever he gave such a piercingly apt and brilliant answer, she would realize why she had liked him for so long.</p>
<p>His thoughtfulness, honest and direct attitude, and ability to read situations were sparkling, valuable, and attractive. It made her feel reassured deep inside.</p>
