            <h3>Chapter 90.2</h3>
<p>However, Richard’s reclusive nature often made people impatient with him.</p>
<p>“Did I wake you up by coming too early?”</p>
<p>As he apologized, Jasmine felt a strange mix of emotions. The man whom everyone complained was so hard to see, she met quite frequently. And now, he was in her home, making the situation even more surreal.</p>
<p>“No, it’s my fault for making you wait.”</p>
<p>“Have you eaten?”</p>
<p>Richard’s low voice asked, likely imagining her usual late-morning routine of nibbling on brunch. His attentive gaze made Jasmine feel that strange sensation again.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>And you, Duke?</p>
<p>“I haven’t either.”</p>
<p>The simplicity of their exchange, coupled with the unexpected intimacy of sharing such a mundane detail, made the moment feel oddly significant.</p>
<p>“Would you like to have breakfast?”</p>
<p>Richard nodded, and they decided to walk around the hall and chat while the meal was being prepared.</p>
<p>As they walked side by side, Richard’s eyes wandered over her slightly damp blonde hair, flushed cheeks, and lips, then down her languidly lowered eyelashes. His gaze traced the soft curves of her body, draped in the light purple dress that flowed gently with her movements.</p>
<p>The sweet scent of her perfume mixed with her natural fragrance, tickling his nose. He suddenly felt a pang of hunger.</p>
<p>“You look beautiful.”</p>
<p>Richard’s eyes met her curious violet ones, and he gestured towards the portrait he had been looking at earlier.</p>
<p>“Even as a child.”</p>
<p>“I was chubby back then. My nickname was Raccoon.”</p>
<p>“Children should be chubby. Being too skinny isn’t healthy.”</p>
<p>Children, he said. Jasmine felt a bit embarrassed by Richard’s firm statement, but it didn’t upset her. She must have been around ten years old in that portrait. She wasn’t fat, but in a society that valued beauty so highly, even young boys and girls often aspired to be slim.</p>
<p>Back then, Jasmine was the youngest, showered with love by the Grand Duke and Duchess and her siblings. She was an innocent girl, uninterested in society and beauty, more focused on playing with her friends.</p>
<p>She grew more slowly than her peers, and while other noble girls were busy managing their figures through exercise and diet, Jasmine was the wide-eyed, adorable “raccoon” among them.</p>
<p>She never minded it, but now she felt a sudden embarrassment showing that part of her past to Richard, who was accustomed to being surrounded by beauties.</p>
<p>Richard, known since childhood as the “Black Prince” or the “Black-haired Adonis,” had always been a strikingly handsome boy, even more noticeable than the girls. He never had an awkward phase. Life really is unfair. And he doesn’t even seem to put in any effort.</p>
<p>As Jasmine’s lips pouted involuntarily, Richard continued to smile, seemingly unaware. He looked genuinely pleased and cheerful.</p>
<p>“I wish I had seen you back then. You looked like a doll. Your nose and face were small and round, your eyes were big, and your cheeks and lips were plump. I thought you were a little angel.”</p>
<p>Jasmine was taken aback by Richard’s words, delivered with a casual smile. ‘What the hell? Why is he acting like this? Where did he learn to say things like that?’ Despite her brain stuttering, her heart began to pound in response to his compliments.</p>
<p>Feeling embarrassed, Jasmine fanned her flushed face with her hand.</p>
<p>“No, I mean, what… You’ve gotten quite good at flattery since I last saw you.”</p>
<p>“I’m serious.”</p>
<p>‘I don’t believe you.’ Richard furrowed his brow, mumbling to himself, which only made Jasmine’s neck start to feel hot. W’hat is wrong with this man? He seems so different after returning from the battlefield. He was always capable of saying embarrassing things, but this is on another level.’</p>
<p>“You must have never had an unpretty moment. Were you born beautiful?”</p>
<p>Though he was speaking to himself, Jasmine, standing next to him, heard every word. Unable to hold back any longer, she shouted.</p>
<p>“Ah! Stop it, please! You must be crazy!”</p>
<p>Richard dodged her as she seemed ready to grab his collar, tilting his head in confusion.</p>
<p>“Why are you acting like you’ve never been called pretty before?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not that, but no one says it like you do!”</p>
<p>Except for my mom, dad, and brothers! No one else should be able to say that! No, they shouldn’t!</p>
<p>Richard, still not understanding, looked down at the wildcat-like Jasmine.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with calling something beautiful when it is?”</p>
<p>“Just stop! Don’t say it!”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. I’ll just think it to myself.”</p>
<p>“Don’t even think it!”</p>
<p>“Thinking is my prerogative, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Then think it quietly.”</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>Richard couldn’t hold back his laughter any longer and clutched his stomach as he burst out laughing. Jasmine, red-faced and fuming, glared at him as he bent over with laughter. She was already irritable from hunger and now felt an urge to smack him.</p>
<p>Though his overly handsome appearance from head to toe made her hesitate, she considered hitting the back of his head. It should be fine, right? Given Richard’s personality, he wouldn’t officially complain to the Grand Duke’s family over a single hit.</p>
<p>Clenching her fists and trembling with frustration, she was finally brought back to her senses by Mari’s announcement that breakfast was ready. She trudged towards the dining room,</p>
<p>while Richard, still chuckling, watched her with amusement. ‘What am I going to do with her?’</p>
<p>Jasmine’s mood, which had been gloomy, quickly improved when she saw the table laden with dishes prepared by the chef.</p>
<p>Richard, observing her rapid change in expression from across the table, struggled to suppress another bout of laughter and lowered his head, pretending not to notice.</p>
<p>Jasmine quickly finished her soup and tore off pieces of bread to dip into the stew, occasionally glancing at Richard, who seemed to be sighing lightly and making faces.</p>
<p>‘What’s his deal?’ She tilted her head in confusion. ‘Why is he acting like this at the dining table? It’s ruining my appetite.’</p>
