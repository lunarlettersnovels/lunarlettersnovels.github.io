            <p><strong>Chapter 35.2</strong></p>
<p>She whimpered as her love juices spread eagerly. It was so adorable and delicious. Soaked well like a watery peach.</p>
<p>He hugged Jasmine and steadied her against the wall of the stable. She lightly m0aned as his fingers thrusted inside her dripping vag!na.</p>
<p>She sniffled and leaned the back of her head against his wide chest as his lips landed on her closed eyes, temples, and soft ears.</p>
<p>It was her favorite of his many caresses. How to explain it? Because she felt cherished and loved.</p>
<p>Richard rubbed his erection against her lower region. His throbbing member popped out of his pants against her disheveled buttocks, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>“That’s right. You’re beautiful.”</p>
<p><em>‘I want to keep you all to myself forever.</em>’</p>
<p>His low, lu!stful voice scattered through her ears.</p>
<p>His moist lips peppered her watery eyes while he grasped the elastic waistband of her panties, pulling them down. The sticky liquid trailed after them, and as he removed her soaking under!wear, the dark blue eyes became even darker.</p>
<p>“Ever since I saw you riding a horse in these pants, I’ve wanted to do this.”</p>
<p>He grabbed her wrist, aimed between her swollen thighs, and grinded her hips against his member. Up and down as Jasmine trembled.</p>
<p>“Holding you underneath me while I fu!ck you and you’re crying.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Richard!”</p>
<p>“Haah, it’s unbelievable. To have this beauty all to myself.”</p>
<p>His blue eyes stared intently at the shaking woman in his arms.</p>
<p>“I’m the only one who saw it, right? Answer me.”</p>
<p>“Yes.. yes.”</p>
<p>“In the future?”</p>
<p>“Heuk! Tes!”</p>
<p>He couldn’t tell if it was a moan or agreement, but it sounded like an answer. It wasn’t enough yet. But it was enough to get him excited.</p>
<p>There was the sound of him hurriedly unbuckling his pants and freeing his swollen member. He lightly brushed it against her soft thighs and squeezed his eyes shut.</p>
<p>He was so excited that his member pulsed and twitched.</p>
<p>He had to loosen up a bit more… But he felt like he might die if he didn’t enter this woman right now.</p>
<p>Holding her hips apart and aiming at her dripping core, he thrust firmly. She gasped as he filled her to the end. It felt like she had completely adjusted to his length now.</p>
<p>Grasping her trembling buttocks possesively, he gently patted her. Her red, swollen folds, engorged with desire, eagerly swallowed his thick length and dripped as it savored every bit of him.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s shoulders quivered as Richard’s tantalizing lips kissed her skin. He thrust into her so deeply that it felt like he scratched a satisfying itch inside her walls. Jasmine gasped and wrapped her legs around him tightly.</p>
<p><em>‘Ah, it as too much!’</em></p>
<p>As he pounded rhythmically into her, Jasmine could no longer contain her cries.</p>
<p>A series of le!wd sounds could be heard continuously inside the quiet stable where well-trained horses trotted calmly.</p>
<p>The clean and polished space, almost like a family home, was immaculate, and the caretaker’s neatly stacked baskets had collapsed. Unable to withstand the force of his entry, Jasmine clutched the pillar, mouth agape, and m0aned.</p>
<p>She was panting heavily; this was the second time already.</p>
<p>There was no sign of the end to their lovemaking. As he thrust shallowly into her while she gr0aned and squirmed, unable to bear it, she whimpered.</p>
<p>His engorged pen!s was parting her pink mounds and crushing it all the same as he repeatedly thrusted inside her. He forced her shaking legs wide open to receive all of him.</p>
<p>With her hips held tightly, he gazed down at her with a fervent expression, and a corner of her heart throbbed painfully. The shade made it hard to read his expression, but shadows couldn’t hide the intense gaze.</p>
<p>His low groans, even though muttered, seemed to touch her nerves vividly. Her earlobes tingled.</p>
<p>Her toes scraped down his sweaty, toned back. As if in response, he dragged her ankle and she watched him suck it. She felt a thrill in her lower stomach. She didn’t know if it was because she was captivated by those elegant, hooded eyes.</p>
<p>When their eyes met, he smiled mischievously. Jasmine couldn’t help but mumble to herself. He was like a fox.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>She blinked her eyes blankly and slowly swayed as he did. He lowered his head over her and whispered as she was melting beneath him.</p>
<p>“Is there anything you want?”</p>
<p>“Ah..!”</p>
<p>“Ha, huh? Anything.”</p>
<p>Tell me. Anything will do.</p>
<p>His tongue, oozing sweetness, teased her earlobes. The tenderness, le!wdness, and sensuality teased her senses, making her feel like she was going mad.</p>
<p>Ah! Ah! As he bounced her frame up and down his manh0od, she couldn’t hold back and groaned. When she writhed, he kissed her flushed cheeks, neck, forehead, and hair.</p>
<p>The large man thrust slowly and deeply to the edge of her womanhood. It felt overwhelming.</p>
<p>It’s good, so good that I might die, yet I’m afraid of being devoured from head to toe.</p>
<p>Like waves crashing, he relentlessly entered her. For the first time, Jasmine realized the source of the overwhelming urgency, nervousness, and restlessness she felt every time she shared a bed with Richard.</p>
<p>On the bed, he resembled a ruffian rather than a gentleman.</p>
<p>He pursued, tasted, and indulged in her without restraint. The calm and cool eyes he usually possessed now burned with passion and seemed insatiable.</p>
