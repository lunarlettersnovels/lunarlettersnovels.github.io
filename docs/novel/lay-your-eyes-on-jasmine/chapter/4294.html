            <p><strong>Chapter 33.1</strong></p>
<p>What was it exactly?</p>
<p>As he pondered this question, Richard suddenly felt embarrassed when he saw the expression on Jasmine’s face, as if she had known all along.</p>
<p>“I find it hard to control myself because I enjoy fu!cking you. Being intimate with you.”</p>
<p>He blurted it out as directly as always. It had been a thought circling in his mind, so saying it out loud didn’t feel awkward.</p>
<p>However, Jasmine’s vision seemed to be spinning at the sudden fastball. Seriously, wasn’t he known for being the epitome of proper manners? Why was he so straightforward?!</p>
<p>“So… this is the first time for you, and it might be challenging. I thought about limiting it to once a day or maybe once every two days… but once wasn’t enough, and if we continue, I can’t help doing it. It’s even harder to stop once our lips touch…”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait a minute!”</p>
<p>Jasmine interrupted Richard’s heated ramblings by placing a finger across his lips. She raised her eyebrows and casually glanced around, lifting herself on her tiptoes to see if anyone was eavesdropping.</p>
<p>If the Duke of Aion, the epitome of decency, were caught shamelessly saying such provocative and lewd words with his usual composure, Jasmine would be too embarrassed to show her face in high society for quite a while.</p>
<p>Her friends would have enjoyed the rumors and shrugged it off like it was a medal, saying, “My lover loves to do it with me to death, so I should be proud of it. Why should I be embarrassed?” But Jasmine just couldn’t understand such an open culture.</p>
<p>In any case, Jasmine loved making se!x with him passionately but was somewhat conservative at the same time, as ironic as it sounded.</p>
<p>“Hey, could you lower your voice!”</p>
<p>To her surprise, Richard smiled, tilting his head as she turned red in desperation. Is this his answer? Jasmine found his fox-like expression intriguing, and with a snort, she took a step back.</p>
<p>“What are you saying? We need to talk more. So, I think our relationship is progressing too quickly!”</p>
<p>“I like it being fast.”</p>
<p>Since they would have to get engaged soon, why drag their feet? Richard, who had once been a staunch advocate of being single, couldn’t understand why anyone would hesitate.</p>
<p>Jasmine, glaring at him, sighed as he showed his dissatisfaction. Regardless of how good he was, her intuition told her there was still a long way to go.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Then, may I be more honest?”</p>
<p>Richard asked seriously, his expression cautious and thoughtful. Jasmine blinked her eyes and nodded. It was her inner desire. She wanted to connect with him more sincerely and deeply.</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness.”</p>
<p>But she didn’t expect this.</p>
<p>Jasmine looked down at the mountain of beautiful golden antlers and the silver-gray wolf furs before her. It was as if he had cleared all the beasts of the hill.</p>
<p>Naturally, there was no one among the nobles who received as much bounty as she did, both men and women. Envy and admiration filled their eyes, and her nape turned red as the onlookers gathered.</p>
<p>However, It wasn’t as awkward as she expected after their short conversation earlier. If the game had been given to Prince Jilian instead of her, she would have <em>actually </em>felt bad.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t all joy either. Her heart was also pounding from embarrassment and awkwardness.</p>
<p>She still didn’t know Richard Aion very well.</p>
<p>Jasmine never thought he would do this so openly without worrying about how others might think. She misunderstood him a lot. She thought he was a gentleman who attached great importance to appearance and manners, but he seemed to be different from that when it came to her.</p>
<p>She thought he would be rough and straightforward, but not to <em>this</em> extent.</p>
<p>Richard Aion was relentless when he focused on one thing. He was thorough, bold, and greedy. It was his innate nature. Of course, Jasmine had not yet seen his true character until now.</p>
<p>She watched in amazement as the dashing man leaped from the horse and walked towards her.</p>
<p>The Duke of Iron Blood, thought to be made of steel, bent his waist, took Jasmine’s weak hand, and kissed it. The simple gesture was so graceful and charming that the nobles who followed them couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration.</p>
<p>Among them, one elegant lady with a fancy feather fan sent Jasmine a wink filled with “Well done, girl,” between women. An awkward smile crept onto Jasmine’s lips.</p>
<p>“I would like to offer all of my bounty today to the most beautiful lady in this place.”</p>
<p>“Thank you… You are truly <em>remarkable</em>.”</p>
<p>The last word had a double meaning. She was unsure whether he caught the teasing in her voice or not. Still, Richard raised his eyes and stared at Jasmine intently.</p>
<p>He had an intense gaze. It felt like he wasn’t just looking, but it was as if he had trapped her with the emotions in his eyes. Or maybe it was because of his firm grip on her hand, making her shudder as if she had been licked.</p>
