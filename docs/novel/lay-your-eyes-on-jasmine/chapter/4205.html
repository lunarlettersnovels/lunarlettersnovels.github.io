            <h3>Chapter 77.2</h3>
<p>With a sigh, Jasmine began her story.</p>
<p>“The truth is, my friend Marian…”</p>
<p>She provided a concise summary, omitting unnecessary details. Despite the sudden tale of romantic entanglement, Richard listened seriously, as if attending a lecture, without blinking an eye.</p>
<p>When Jasmine finished, he furrowed his brows and nodded. Even though it was a provocative and embarrassing matter to outsiders, he maintained a calm demeanor, showing no interest or embarrassment. Then he asked,</p>
<p>“So you came here personally to find out if your friend’s husband is indeed having an affair?”</p>
<p>“That’s part of it, and it would be great to get some solid evidence.”</p>
<p>“Why not leave such matters to professionals or subordinates?”</p>
<p>Even if they were close friends, did she, as part of a Grand Duchy, need to be involved personally? Richard was displeased with that. He didn’t like the idea of Jasmine being involved in such sordid matters, regardless of whether Sir Soyer was actually cheating. Jasmine shrugged at his remark.</p>
<p>“That might be an option, but what if word gets out? If rumors spread, Marian would suffer more. And besides, I’m not even sure it’s true. I suspect it might just be a misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>If Jasmine had felt otherwise, she would have acted as Richard suggested. Richard, though reluctant, nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“If that’s your wish. Count Atlante is quite stubborn in that regard, so I share the same sentiment.”</p>
<p>“Really? I suppose a man’s perspective would differ.”</p>
<p>Jasmine snapped her fingers.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, you have some connection, don’t you? You were senior and junior at the academy, right?”</p>
<p>“Most high-ranking nobles attended the academy. Well, we’ve had a few personal interactions and quite a few professional ones. We’re both in the military and have participated in battles together.”</p>
<p>Richard rubbed his chin thoughtfully. The military consisted of the central army, the border guard, and the five knightly orders directly under the Emperor. The black, white, blue, green, and red knightly orders were elite units composed of the Empire’s finest knights, and Richard also served as the Commander of the Black Knights.</p>
<p>He often worked with Soyer, Commander of the White Knights, in joint operations. While some aides expressed concern over Soyer’s hot-tempered and bold behavior, Richard observed his disposition and combat style and entrusted him with full authority.</p>
<p>Though he appeared wild, Soyer was dedicated to victory and knew his limits. Richard’s opinion of him remained unchanged.</p>
<p>“He’s a straightforward person. He’s highly vigilant, has a strong sense of morality, and clear likes and dislikes. His unrestrained nature stems from strict self-discipline and pride. This rigor applies equally to others. His directness often causes friction with colleagues, but his sincerity and success rate in missions make up for it.”</p>
<p>Richard spoke methodically as if reading a strategic profile of Soyer.</p>
<p>“I can’t say for certain. What I know is based on work, and personal matters could be different. However, if his nature is as I understand it, he would more likely choose separation or divorce rather than secretly having an affair.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, considering his personality,” Jasmine nodded.</p>
<p>She hadn’t thought of that angle, but Richard’s analytical mind offered a different perspective. His calm words were persuasive.</p>
<p>“So, what about him as a man?”</p>
<p>“As a man?”</p>
<p>Richard’s lips curved slightly.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not sure how to put it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on. There must be some talk among the men. Don’t hold back.”</p>
<p>People say women understand women better and men understand men better. Immersed in the conversation, Jasmine spoke casually, almost as if they had returned to old times. Richard, who had been watching her intently, chuckled softly.</p>
<p>“There aren’t any particular rumors or opinions about him. Most comments focus on his fiery temper. But I’ve heard he’s clean in his relationships with women. He certainly appears to be.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by ‘appears to be’?”</p>
<p>“He dislikes lewd talk and finds the war brothel systems of other countries distasteful. When such topics arise, he frowns or leaves. It might be because he grew up with many older sisters.”</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>A man who was clean both in public and private was rare. Jasmine adjusted her impression of her friend’s husband upwards. It was an unexpected but fitting quality.</p>
<p>As she let out a sigh of relief, she looked at Richard with a curious expression. He flinched unknowingly.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me like that…?”</p>
<p>“And what about you, Duke?”</p>
<p>Her eyes were evaluative and curious. Though it seemed a casual question, Richard felt his pores prickling.</p>
