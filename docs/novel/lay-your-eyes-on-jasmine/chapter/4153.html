            <p><strong>Chapter 104.1</strong></p>
<p>The three male Liovanni, who had been glaring at the intruder, quickly became docile and entered the mansion following her instructions. Jasmine glanced at the expressionless Richard before quickly scampering to stick close to her mother at her call.</p>
<p>It felt reassuring, as if she had gained a reliable ally.</p>
<p>“Mother!”</p>
<p>“Is my daughter just coming in now? I heard you were playing with Marian.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but Joshua was sick so our plans were canceled.”</p>
<p>“Oh, is that so? Poor dear being sick. We should send some good medicine to the Count’s residence.”</p>
<p>“Wow, Mother, you’re the best!”</p>
<p>As her daughter naturally linked arms with her, the Grand Duchess stroked her head and then, as if suddenly remembering something, wrinkled her nose and gave Richard a gentle smile.</p>
<p>“I forgot we had a guest. My husband can be quite harsh, so please don’t take offense if he hurt your feelings. They say people only get more disagreeable with age. Do try to understand, as a young person.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. Everything he said was correct.”</p>
<p>The Grand Duchess’s lips curved into a smile at the Duke’s polite response.</p>
<p>“How kind of you. Of course, any feelings only have meaning when they’re mutual. Just like when our child was young and thoughtless.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Since it’s cold outside, warm wine would be nice. Butler, please escort our guest to the reception room. Jasmine, you should change your clothes. We’ll be having dinner soon.”</p>
<p>Having naturally separated Richard and Jasmine, the Grand Duchess took her daughter’s hand and quickly ascended to the second floor.</p>
<p>Richard smiled bitterly as he watched the back of Jasmine’s chick-yellow head disappear, as she followed the Grand Duchess without a backward glance, suddenly transformed into an innocent, affectionate youngest child at her mother’s appearance.</p>
<p>“This won’t be easy.”</p>
<p>There was an even more formidable opponent than the Grand Duke.</p>
<p>Jasmine descended to the reception room with light steps, wearing a pale yellow empire dress chosen by her mother.</p>
<p>After removing her heavy outdoor clothes and taking a simple wash with warm water, she felt alive again with her hair comfortably let down and wearing a light indoor gown.</p>
<p>Her small feet in soft lambskin indoor shoes tapped the stairs rhythmically, as if dancing a waltz. Though she felt unsettled by Richard’s unexpected encounter with her family, seeing her mother’s gentle yet firm eyes made everything seem alright.</p>
<p>This was her home, wasn’t it! The house where Jasmine was born and raised. Nothing unfortunate or troublesome had ever happened to her in this house.</p>
<p>When Jasmine arrived at the reception room, her family, seated around the table as always, welcomed her. Mother Eliza, who first heard Jasmine’s footsteps, smiled brightly and extended her hand.</p>
<p>“Oh my, our darling. Just like when you used to dance ballet as a child. You look so pretty.”</p>
<p>“Ah, now that you mention it, you’re right. It really is like back then. Did Eliza choose it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Doesn’t it suit her perfectly? Isn’t she like a spring dandelion?”</p>
<p>“More like a freesia, I’d say. Or perhaps a yellow jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t she look more like a chick? Remember that chick Jasmine’s tutor gave her? We raised it until it became a chicken.”</p>
<p>James chuckled mid-sip of his tea when Caras spoke following his stream of consciousness. Ah, that.</p>
<p>“What happened to that chicken? Did a wild cat get it?”</p>
<p>“We let it loose at the villa. Did the caretaker eat it?”</p>
<p>“That’s not true! I heard it’s still living well in the countryside!”</p>
<p>Jasmine, who had been basking in her parents’ praise, heard her brothers’ back-and-forth conversation and responded curtly.</p>
<p>The former Grand Duke and Duchess, Jasmine’s grandparents, were spending their peaceful retirement in the scenic countryside.</p>
<p>When the pets the siblings raised in their childhood died of old age or unexpected accidents, their parents would tell white lies about sending them to grandfather’s house, worried the children might be hurt.</p>
<p>And Jasmine was always the most susceptible to such lies. Though she was a playful and clever girl, perhaps her affectionate nature made her want to believe these white lies.</p>
<p>In truth, how could the adult Jasmine not know? She simply didn’t want to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Caras burst out laughing, and James smirked as he gazed at his sister, still maintaining her adorable stubbornness.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, do you still believe that?”</p>
<p>“I’ll believe it as long as I want to. Grandmother still sends news about it in her letters.”</p>
<p>“That’s because Grandmother still thinks you’re her ten-year-old granddaughter.”</p>
<p>Caras chuckled while messing up Jasmine’s hair. Though Jasmine was annoyed that her carefully brushed hair was becoming a bird’s nest, she let it be because she loved when her brothers touched her hair with affection.</p>
<p>As she combed her hair with her fingers, Jasmine glanced at Richard, who sat quietly among her family members until now.</p>
<p>In the warm atmosphere, Richard quickly turned his head when his eyes met Jasmine’s. What was that? As she watched him uneasily, his shoulders seemed to shake with laughter. Oh, really.</p>
<p>Jasmine crossed her arms in displeasure and sat on the sofa. She had worried that Richard might feel isolated on his first visit to this house, but that didn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Well, Mother was there to keep the men of the house from being too temperamental, and Richard was a perfect nobleman, from social conversation to dance and manners. He should blend well enough in such a casual gathering. Though Father and her brothers were still somewhat concerning…</p>
