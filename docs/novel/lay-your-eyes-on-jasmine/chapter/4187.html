            <h3>Chapter 86.2</h3>
<p>There were times when she cried alone at night, but even then, she ate well and never declined invitations from friends. Not only that, she dated—quite a lot, in fact. Jasmine deliberately ignored the fleeting names of numerous past lovers that flashed through her mind.</p>
<p>So what? Did I cheat, or commit adultery? What’s wrong with having a few relationships like everyone else?</p>
<p>Jasmine briefly wondered if Richard knew about her ridiculous nickname, “The Seven Day Lily,” but she decided not to ask. She didn’t want to bring up that nickname herself. Perhaps, given his usual indifference to social gossip, he might not know yet.</p>
<p>She decided to change the subject and asked,</p>
<p>“What was that song you were humming earlier?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“The song you were just singing…”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>He chuckled.</p>
<p>“You said you were asleep, but it seems your ears were open.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tease me.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing special… It was a lullaby my mother used to sing. I think it was a folk song from the northern region.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that makes sense.”</p>
<p>The melody did seem exotic and unique. When she shared her impression, Richard smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I’m not sure if I got the tune right. My mother wasn’t particularly musically inclined.”</p>
<p>“Do you really need musical talent for a lullaby?”</p>
<p>“Depending on the situation?”</p>
<p>“What kind of situation?”</p>
<p>“She was tone-deaf.”</p>
<p>Richard mercilessly revealed his mother’s complex. Jasmine found it absurd but somewhat amusing.</p>
<p>“I heard the late Duchess was a stunningly beautiful, elegant, and refined lady.”</p>
<p>“She was indeed beautiful and elegant, but I’m not sure about refined. She had quite a mischievous streak.”</p>
<p>“Are you badmouthing your late mother?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s the truth.”</p>
<p>Jasmine couldn’t help but let out a short laugh. His voice was so tender and warm that she assumed he must have many fond memories with his mother.</p>
<p>“You must have been close to your mother.”</p>
<p>“I thought we were close, but looking back now, I realize I was probably closer to my father. My mother was a good person, but she was often ill and, and she was a typical northerner, not the kind of person who raised her children in her arms.”</p>
<p>Richard paused. He loved his mother and was loved by her, but unfortunately, there weren’t many memories to recall beyond his very early childhood.</p>
<p>Well, most noble families are like this. It wasn’t a particularly unique situation. Moreover, his mother passed away at a young age. He would sometimes look at Risha’s face and remember that his mother had a similar face.</p>
<p>Then, Jasmine’s small voice broke the silence.</p>
<p>“Still, you must miss her.”</p>
<p>If it were me, I would have cried every day, missing my mom. Her delicate, almost childlike whisper made Richard realize anew that she was someone who had grown up receiving abundant love from her family.</p>
<p>Even without Jasmine explicitly saying it, her unwrinkled, wide smile, her warm and generous nature, her ease in giving and receiving love, and her cheerful and kind personality all radiated the love and care she had received.</p>
<p>When he didn’t know any better, her qualities made Richard feel a sense of distance, as if she were fundamentally different from him. He didn’t realize it was the opposite. How could he not be interested while unconsciously keeping an eye on her? Her endearing qualities naturally drew his attention.</p>
<p>Reflecting on these belated realizations, Richard thought to himself that he had been quite foolish. Now he saw that he knew nothing—not even the basic things everyone else knew, nor about himself.</p>
<p>Wanting to reassure Jasmine, who was watching him with bated breath, he continued speaking.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. My father practically raised me, so I didn’t have much time to feel my mother’s absence.”</p>
<p>“He sounds like a very family-oriented father.”</p>
<p>“Well, he might not be the image you have in mind.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, Richard would reflect on how his upbringing felt akin to military training. It was true that the late Duke was particularly strict with his eldest son, the heir.</p>
<p>Although he felt his father’s love in the large hand that would secretly pat his head as he fell asleep, exhausted from training, or in the proud smile his father showed at his achievements, young Richard always found his ever-present father both intimidating and admirable, and he longed for his approval.</p>
<p>Perhaps because he grew up as such a good son, he did go through a brief rebellious phase in his teenage years. It seemed so childish in hindsight.</p>
<p>Richard chuckled softly.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, I feel that you and I are very different.”</p>
<p>“In what way?”</p>
<p>“Jasmine, you just sparkle and are so lovable. Unlike me, you didn’t grow up rough or strict and always seemed to be happy.”</p>
<p>Jasmine found his words incredulous.</p>
<p>“What fairy tale princess are you talking about? You must not know how much of a wild child I was, Duke Aion.”</p>
<p>“I can imagine you were quite the troublemaker.”</p>
<p>“Troublemaker? If my brothers, James and Karas, heard such a mild description, they wouldn’t be able to hold back their tears.”</p>
<p>Richard chuckled at her solemn and serious declaration. Jasmine, clicking her tongue, insisted she wasn’t joking.</p>
<p>“You met me when I was at my best. During my prime, even the strictest tutors would run away at the sight of my skirt. Then my mother would grab me by the neck and scold me. She was really scary. But I kept doing it anyway.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but burst into laughter. Imagining the mischievous girl with sparkling violet eyes, he couldn’t stop himself from laughing. He almost regretted not knowing her as a child.</p>
<p>“When I was young, I really didn’t study much. It just wasn’t fun. So, I even failed the entrance exam for the academy. Oh, this is a secret. My friends think I’m home-schooled because I wasn’t interested in academics.”</p>
<p>“…You failed the academy entrance exam?”</p>
