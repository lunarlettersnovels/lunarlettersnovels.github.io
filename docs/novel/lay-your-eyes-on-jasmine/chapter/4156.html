            <h3>Chapter 102.2</h3>
<p>Half a year ago, Jasmine, who thought Richard was her entire world, was foolishly single-minded. But not anymore. The problem lay with Richard. He wanted her, someone who had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>He wanted this woman to be his. From head to toe. Everything. Every glance, every bit of attention, every thought. If he could, he wanted to consume her soul.</p>
<p>How could he achieve that?</p>
<p>How could he possess her?</p>
<p>Marriage was the most convenient method. That’s why, half a year ago, he tried to bind her with that shackle. He failed spectacularly. And now, Jasmine had become skeptical about marriage itself. The prospect of having her seemed more distant than ever.</p>
<p>It felt like trying to catch a butterfly that kept fluttering away. Resting his chin on his hand, he gazed at her innocent face and eventually gave a faint smile.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering what I’m thinking right now…</p>
<p>“I’m not going to tell you.”</p>
<p>“But you asked. Why not?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Richard slowly reached out his hand. He moved so slowly that she wouldn’t feel threatened or try to escape. He cupped her cheek and gently stroked it. She raised her eyebrows but didn’t seem to think much of it yet. As expected. His lips curved upward, but his eyes remained cold.</p>
<p>He continued to caress her plump cheek and ear tenderly, moving his fingers leisurely. His fingers slid down, and his thumb pressed against her unusually red and plump lips. It felt like pressing into the flesh of a ripe plum.</p>
<p>The scent and the texture. Only then did Jasmine pull her head back in surprise, but Richard smoothly supported the back of her neck, gently but firmly holding her in place.</p>
<p>She needed to be a bit more careful.</p>
<p>His blue eyes darkened deeply.</p>
<p>So that bastards like me don’t latch onto you.</p>
<p>“Richard, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Richard asked with his eyes. His twisted smile probably formed a sinister line. Though he didn’t fully understand yet, he instinctively felt a slight unease, and he gently caressed the rim of her ear as she watched him intently, her senses heightened.</p>
<p>His cold reflection was captured in her wide, amethyst-colored eyes. As he drew closer, her eyelashes fluttered rapidly, and her breathing quickened. The closer he got, the more he could smell her sweet scent. He brushed his nose against her skin, almost touching, and let out a low, sigh-like groan.</p>
<p>“Well… I’m afraid you’ll avoid me if you know what I’m thinking.”</p>
<p>He whispered this as he brushed a short kiss on her cheek and then stepped back neatly. It was only then that Jasmine realized he was continuing the sentence he had left unfinished earlier.</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes and stared at him, but Richard only held a faint smile, offering no further explanation. It felt familiar. This wasn’t the first time. He often didn’t hide his twisted nature in front of her.</p>
<p>Jasmine crossed her arms and watched the man, who was clearly uncomfortable despite his pretty smile. She let out a dry laugh.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you’ll adjust everything for me?</p>
<p>“I’m listening to you and behaving well, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>“Behaving well? This is?”</p>
<p>Clearly showing his displeasure just because she said she wasn’t thinking about marriage right now. As she looked at him in disbelief, Richard lowered his eyes gloomily. There he goes again.</p>
<p>“Is it bad that I kissed you a bit?”</p>
<p>“From now on, ask for permission first.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>He answered so obediently. Jasmine looked at his handsome yet calm face with a troubled expression, feeling like a dog owner burdened with a large, mischievous dog. What should she do with him?</p>
<p>Her head spun. The old her would have been helplessly dragged along by him. But not now. Jasmine sighed and crossed her arms, resting her temples as she pondered.</p>
<p>She crossed her legs slowly, almost deliberately, revealing her slender ankle and the curve of her heel beneath the lace-trimmed hem. The bustle dress she wore today was designed to emphasize her chest and slim waist, highlighting her feminine allure.</p>
<p>It was slightly uncomfortable, but the effect was exactly as intended.</p>
<p>His clear blue eyes were immediately drawn to the contrast of her narrow waist, emphasized chest, and hourglass figure, down to her exposed ankle. Men were indeed susceptible to visual stimuli.</p>
<p>Richard’s reactions to her were always immediate and quick, yet he tried to control and conceal them. The men she had met so far often lacked even that.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was more accurate to say they lacked the skill or patience to restrain themselves. As a result, her experiences with such men, whom she had appropriately dealt with, had been a good study in understanding where men were vulnerable.</p>
<p>Look at the heat that occasionally surfaced in those calm blue eyes. His half-lowered gaze was now following the trace of her ankle that had slipped under her skirt.</p>
<p>Jasmine momentarily hesitated at his seemingly composed yet lewd expression as he licked his lips, but she called out to him with a slight edge.</p>
<p>“Duke Richard Aion.”</p>
<p>The blue eyes, which had been behaving like a wolf that smelled blood, now faced her meekly. She clicked her tongue, thinking that perhaps no one could feign innocence as well as this man.</p>
<p>“Behave yourself. You promised.”</p>
<p>At her gentle command, Richard let out a small laugh. His blatant gaze met her upright stance before he bowed his head.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>This time, Jasmine did not stop him as he respectfully kissed the back of her hand.</p>
