            <h3>Chapter 61.1</h3>
<p>Richard felt anger and shame from his powerlessness.</p>
<p>It would be a lie to say he harbored no resentment toward her. There were many times when he dreamed of an extremely treacherous and seductive devil tearing apart his peace and taking on Jasmine’s form.</p>
<p>He had never experienced such hardships and trials in his lifetime.</p>
<p>What others called rough and tough events, harder than the average, were actually things Richard could bear. Hence, his arrogance, rigid perspective, and indifferent behavior towards others’ negative emotions might have originated from that.</p>
<p>He had never truly experienced them. Since he didn’t experience any trials, he didn’t understand others’ pain well.</p>
<p><em>“Well, what would a person who has never lacked anything know?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Do people think everyone is as competent and strong as you?”</em></p>
<p>He didn’t know why those words, especially the sharp ones Jasmine had once thrown at him, were coming to mind now.</p>
<p>She always did that. She dug up, poked, and prodded things that even he didn’t know existed deep inside him. She was the first to pierce him so deeply.</p>
<p>So, while he was furious and ashamed, he found himself helplessly drawn to Jasmine’s lovely, mischievous face, her sharp tongue, and her laughter.</p>
<p>Like a dragon provoked, his attention was focused on this one little woman. Even though he politely pretended not to care, his eyes, ears, and senses followed her every move.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because she was the only one who could read and understand his difficult and boring innermost thoughts. Maybe it was because she was the only one who noticed and recognized it.</p>
<p>The little lady had no fear.</p>
<p>What do I believe in and what motivates me?’</p>
<p>Though he felt like asking what she knew to say that, deep down, he knew she was right. Maybe it was the insight he needed.</p>
<p>He probably kept thinking about her who had liked him for a long time for the same reason. He was curious. He wanted to know. He had already started to be interested, but he was too foolish to notice.</p>
<p>Maybe I… since then…</p>
<p>Richard rested his forehead in the cool water. He let out a rough sigh as if he wanted to cry.</p>
<p>“Da!mn it.”</p>
<p>He really wanted to see her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jasmine felt slightly tired.</p>
<p>Despite her companion, now on their 7th day, cheerfully chatting away, she couldn’t help but think about something else while smiling like a doll.</p>
<p>For instance, when would be the most appropriate time to bring up the idea of breaking up.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, what tea would you like?”</p>
<p>“Anything but Jasmine tea.”</p>
<p>“Haha. You’re kidding, right?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He laughed heartily, but Jasmine didn’t laugh much. Most people made jokes like this using her name, but she always meant them.</p>
<p>Honestly, she didn’t quite understand what was funny. She clearly disliked it, so what’s amusing about it? She just smiled politely to avoid ruining the mood.</p>
<p>At the riverside café, a cool breeze tickled her cheeks. Jasmine naturally turned her gaze to admire the beautiful ripples of the river. Yellow, crimson, wine-colored—the trees painted various shades over the water.</p>
<p>Autumn leaves fluttered like butterflies, settling on the lace tablecloth. Long eyelashes gazed down at them, casting a dense shadow.</p>
<p>The season had changed again. Like this, to no avail.</p>
<p>Suddenly, everything felt empty and meaningless. Even though she lacked nothing, why did she feel so hollow? Sometimes, she felt like she was lost.</p>
<p>As Jasmine looked at the river with vacant eyes, Peterson spoke up.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking, Jasmine?”</p>
<p>“About you.”</p>
<p>“Ah? Haha, that’s thrilling.”</p>
<p>It was true. I’m contemplating when would be the right time to break up with you, she thought. But he doesn’t seem to realize this.</p>
<p>“To be honest, my lady doesn’t know how grateful I am that you accepted my confession. I knew you didn’t prefer deep relationships, but my feelings were too deep and earnest…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, his face was full of emotions as he released his innermost thoughts. Jasmine suddenly thought that he must know her ridiculous nickname, “Seven-Day Lily”.</p>
<p>Then why did this person ask me to date? What significance does a mere week-long relationship hold?</p>
<p>If he were in his right mind, he wouldn’t have started a relationship in the first place knowing they would break up after a week of playing around.</p>
<p>Unless he was confident that he would be satisfied with just that, or have vain expectations that he could last longer with her. And the men, who were usually greedy for her, were overwhelmingly the latter.</p>
<p>There were those who approached Jasmine, the heiress, wanting to satisfy their vanity or harboring sinister desires beyond just holding hands.</p>
<p>There was nothing special or different with her relationship with Peterson.</p>
