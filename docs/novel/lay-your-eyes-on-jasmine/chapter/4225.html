            <h3>Chapter 67.2</h3>
<p>“I wondered why he acted that way and just let it go. When he proposed, he suddenly said the fountain nearby was pretty. I thought, ‘Thank goodness he’s a knight,’ rather than a diplomat or swindler. Even that time, I wondered why he was grumbling to himself about some trivial matter alone. But since I found it strange, he’s been coming home regularly since then.”</p>
<p>So far, it wasn’t that strange. It could be due to not wanting to worry about work or keeping secrets. Everyone concentrated, and Lichang’s frown softened slightly.</p>
<p>“But even when we share a bed, he’s gradually keeping his distance, turning away or sleeping with his back to me, lost in his thoughts. He wasn’t talkative to begin with, but now he speaks even less.</p>
<p>“He’s become more sensitive and irritable, and even our son is causing trouble over trivial matters related to this issue. We fought over it. Maybe that’s why our intimacy has decreased. Now he won’t even hold my hand or look me in the eye.”</p>
<p>“Well… that does seem strange.”</p>
<p>Lichang murmured quietly when the topic turned to their intimacy.</p>
<p>“And he’s become more secretive. He said he was late several times due to overtime, but when I asked a fellow knight’s wife, she said there was no such thing as overtime that day! He lied once and then lied again!</p>
<p>“It was so odd, I checked his study where he’s suddenly interested in books on medicine, herbalism, and fashion, things he never cared about before. And when I looked suspiciously, he hid them away secretly. But what’s the use? They’re right in my palm! There was even a strange vial of medicine. When I secretly took one out and asked a pharmacist, it turned out to be a medicine men take… when they cheat!”</p>
<p>“Ugh, you knew!”</p>
<p>Jasmine quickly replied, fearing she might be hit. But she couldn’t understand. She glanced at her friends, and they all looked shocked. What, am I the only one who didn’t know?</p>
<p>“He spends nights secretly in his study, writing letters. What kind of letters? He would burn them quickly in the fire and call them operation orders, but it’s a lie! And he suddenly started paying attention to his clothes, even interfering in interior design at home, things he never cared about before.</p>
<p>“He complained about the sofa being dirty. We fought over that, too. When I asked why he was suddenly doing these things, he got angry. He apologized immediately because I was surprised, but he didn’t even come into the bedroom that day.”</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Julia sighed.</p>
<p>“And most importantly…!”</p>
<p>Marianne exclaimed passionately, making everyone tense.</p>
<p>“His scent changed! It smells different. How could that happen without him sleeping with another woman? He should be able to shower in the knight’s hall, but his smell was different. More than anything, his underwear… his underwear is different from when he went out! How can this be explained? Unless he’s cheating!”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>That was the decisive blow. Everyone sighed in unison. Soyer’s unexpected behavior was that of a typical cheating man.</p>
<p>Changes in sleeping frequency, reduced physical contact, secrets, lies, interference with housework possibly due to guilt, heightened emotional sensitivity, suspicious vials of medicine, changed scent, and different underwear.</p>
<p>Their hearts went out to their brave friend. How could they tell her?</p>
<p>Even though Marianne had strong mental fortitude, her friends knew how much she loved her husband and all the hardships she had endured to marry him, a scion of a distinguished family.</p>
<p>Lichang frowned momentarily, then carefully spoke up.</p>
<p>“Maybe we shouldn’t jump to conclusions until we have definitive proof. Have you asked him directly?”</p>
<p>“I asked him yesterday after drinking. I asked if there was another woman. He vehemently denied it! He got mad at me for even thinking that way and threw a fit. If he were truly sorry, wouldn’t he kneel and apologize right away? But maybe that’s not the case. If he really were the husband I know, he wouldn’t cheat in the first place.”</p>
<p>It was like listening to someone else’s story about a crumbling marriage. Jasmine swallowed hard, finding it hard to believe.</p>
<p>‘Wow, this is actually happening around me. And to that perfect couple, Marianne and her husband!’</p>
<p>The signs of a breakup between the people she thought were the most ideal lovers made her feel anxious and strange.</p>
<p>“But… wouldn’t it be worth believing him just once? It could be a misunderstanding…”</p>
<p>“What kind of damn misunderstanding! A person who never lied in his life is now lying like it’s just eating or drinking….! He used to say he loved me the most, that he only needed me. He doesn’t even want to have se*x anymore… In the past, he used to flip the table when we made eye contact!”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Marianne’s increasingly desperate tone was pitiful, but everyone coughed awkwardly, not wanting to delve deeper into her private life. Amidst it all, Marianne was buried in her emotions, crying her heart out.</p>
