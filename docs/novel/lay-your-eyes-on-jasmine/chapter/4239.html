            <h3>Chapter 60.2</h3>
<p>As Richard suddenly grabbed his forehead and breathed heavily, the bewildered lieutenant asked if he was okay, but he waved him off.</p>
<p>Dizziness set in. He felt like he might go mad with longing. He wanted to see her and hold her desperately. It was almost an obsession bordering on hatred.</p>
<p>In the meantime, time passed mercilessly, and Richard mechanically negotiated the ransom of the prisoners, slit enemy throats, and set fire to enemy supplies and depots.</p>
<p>While he was carrying out soulless killings and strategizing, Jasmine broke up with her lover and quickly found another.</p>
<p>For a while, it was common to hear gossip that the belle of society, who previously found the opposite sex uninteresting, was now switching lovers every day.</p>
<p>Every piece of news reached Richard’s ears without fail. And every time, he ruthlessly slit enemy throats without any change in expression. His cruelty was so extreme that even his allies began to avoid him.</p>
<p>Looking down at the blood spatter on his military boots, Richard came to a conclusion after much deliberation.</p>
<p>Desertion was once an option, but it was now discarded.</p>
<p>He couldn’t meet her now. Since he had hurt her until the end, he wanted to treat her with care, even down to the smallest detail.</p>
<p>In this blinded state, he couldn’t meet her.</p>
<p>It was his first rational and reasonable conclusion after a long time. And Jasmine disliked those who didn’t take responsibility, incapable and irresponsible nobles.</p>
<p>He couldn’t do that. He had to finish everything before meeting her. As soon as possible. Before his patience runs out.</p>
<p>Richard now gave up trying to understand Jasmine, whom he had once thought he could understand to some extent.</p>
<p>If he didn’t know, he only needed to ask.</p>
<p>Whether she really forgot him, how much she liked the other guys, whether she let them touch her body, whether she got that da!mn love from someone else—such things.</p>
<p>It was cruel, rough, and full of anger, but he couldn’t bear it. He wanted to know everything, even licking every inch of her toes if necessary. Even if it meant squeezing her till she dripped in pleasure.</p>
<p>It was hard to bear the thought of Jasmine bursting into tears.</p>
<p>“Ha… Jasmine.”</p>
<p>His pen!s was visibly erect under his heated lower abdomen. The unquenched thirst was burning his brain.</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Richard grabbed his pen!s and masturb!ated. The sound of rushing water covered the sound of the male’s rough breath. His tongue, which had reddened his lips, was dry.</p>
<p>Narrowed eyes conjured up stuffed memories in his mind.</p>
<p>The body he held and embraced every day. The fair, plump, and sweet flesh. He vividly remembered her generous curves and her hot, frantic gasps as she wrapped her long legs around his waist. The temperature of the inner walls wrapped him tightly.</p>
<p>As his hand gradually quickened, water splashed violently.</p>
<p>When he held her slim waist and pelvis and fu!cked her like a madman. Her cries resonated exhilaratingly in his ears.</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p><em>“Richard.”</em></p>
<p>He swallowed her moa!ns mixed with sobs. He squeezed her ample brea!sts, twisted them, and pumped his seed inside and outside her several times.</p>
<p>He came deep into her and thrust deeply. Jasmine would take every inch of him as he slammed against her pub!c bone and pelvis. Her round butto!cks squeezed against his toned abdomen.</p>
<p>Even as she trembled with the aftermath of pleasure, she would grind her bottom against him with affection. It felt so good that he would pat her sensitive skin and kiss her on her back as he caressed her lower belly.</p>
<p>She let him repeatedly fu!ck her like this, paying no heed to the white liquid that dripped from their joined nether regions.</p>
<p>She complained that it was hard, but she seemed to have gotten used to Richard’s strange habit of not releasing her even when she came. He soothed her tiredness and stimulated her slowly back again.</p>
<p>Once he got into the mood properly, he changed their positions and fu!cked her again.</p>
<p>Whenever he wanted, she opened herself up. With a flushed face, she shook her hips and spread her legs. The female body, which had not known the male, blossomed wide open because of him.</p>
<p>It was lewd and lovely. The more he possessed Jasmine’s body to his heart’s content, the more he felt superior and satisfied as a man.</p>
<p>This woman is mine. She belongs to me.</p>
<p>But did it really? The authority was merely a temporary privilege granted to him. It was not permanent, nor was it withstanding.</p>
<p>He was arrogant.</p>
<p>“Fu!ck.”</p>
<p>Anger, excitement, and lu!st surged together. Despite the slippery wetness of the lubricant and water, Richard continued to grip and pump.</p>
<p>It was almost a movement close to madness.</p>
<p>He kept violating her in his mind while ejaculating. As the pleasure lazily overtook her, feelings of shame and self-consciousness came with it.</p>
<p>Before long, his icy eyes that looked down at the se!men in the now-cold water. Misery and contempt filled them.</p>
<p>It was the first time he felt so dirty since breaking up with Jasmine.</p>
<p>It felt like he was gradually descending into something less than human. Since parting ways with Jasmine, Richard often found such humiliating evidence everywhere in his thoughts and actions.</p>
