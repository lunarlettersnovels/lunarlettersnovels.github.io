            <p><strong>Chapter 28.1</strong></p>
<p>The man who gently caressed her lower body turned her around, guiding her to lean against the wall, and tenderly kissed her tearful cheek.</p>
<p>He loosened the straps of her attire, unveiling her bare bos0m, which he sensuously kneaded. He pressed his swollen manhood against her soft butt0cks—reminiscent of a male engaging a female in the throes of passion.</p>
<p>“Let’s eat dessert first..,” he growled.</p>
<p>Her response was a soft gasp, and in an instant, their bodies melded together seamlessly. A single droplet of passion dripped from their union and fell to the floor, marking the beginning of their trance.</p>
<p>As soon as he entered her, her inner walls clamped around him, rendering them unable to focus on anything but the waves of pleasure engulfing them. This timeless pattern is a constant in their wild escapades.</p>
<p>Jasmine cried out with abandon, oblivious to the door’s rattling. Her bountiful bre@sts, now unrestrained, swayed in rhythm with his vigorous thrusts.</p>
<p>Richard grasped one of her ankles, hoisting her up as he vigorously ground his hips against her exposed cr0tch. Their intense connection felt like they were peeling away the layers of desire, like skinning and devouring a freshly hunted deer.</p>
<p>The rhythmic, wet sounds were unmistakable. As he skillfully thrust in and out her from behind, the sensation overpowered any discomfort brought on by their positions, leaving them high in ecstasy.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, Richard! Oh!”</p>
<p>“Why?” He responded, his voice strained. “Is this position too much for you?”</p>
<p>“It’s… it’s hard,” she admitted breathlessly. “Ah, yes!”</p>
<p>Richard quickly released her sore ankle and assisted her as she wobbled. Sweat dripped from both of them as if steam rose from their entwined forms. He threw aside his tie, discarding it onto the floor before lifting her legs and spreading them apart.</p>
<p>As Richard placed his lips on Jasmine’s and her arms wrapped around his neck, his heated member parted her petals again. After gently kissing her lips, he took a short breath, grabbed the table’s edge, and began thrusting.</p>
<p>Trapped in his embrace, Jasmine m0aned and held onto him as if clinging to her anchor, her body trembling.</p>
<p>His manhood thrust between her open legs repeatedly. The sturdy wooden table wobbled unsteadily due to their passionate l0vemaking, but the dizzying m0ans and gasps of the man and woman overshadowed the sounds of the table’s movement.</p>
<p>Richard gazed intensely into Jasmine’s tearful eyes beneath him and let out a sigh mixed with laughter. “Am I really this aroused…?”</p>
<p>“Ugh! Ahhhh!”</p>
<p>“What have you done to me?” He licked her cheek and the delicate line of her neck as she writhed in pleasure. Her usually cool, blue eyes were now hazy with desire.</p>
<p>For a moment, the persistent sparkle in his eyes resembled the pupils of a nocturnal creature. He watched her intently as she stubbornly struggled, her hips rocking against him unconsciously. As he flicked her rigid cl!t nestled between her soaked petals, her body convulsed. The scene was mesmerizing and provocative.</p>
<p>He gripped her bre@sts, marked with the impressions of his fingers, and withdrew himself from her clamping walls. Jasmine emitted a low and long m0an.</p>
<p>As her climax neared, her eyes stilled, and her breath quickened. He locked eyes with her and, with a swift motion, took hold of his glistening, engorged manhood and thrust harder inside her. Despite their promiscuity, an overwhelming sense of lu!st surrounded them, leaving their mouths agape.</p>
<p>Before long, Richard let out a deep groan, succumbing to ecstasy. He took out his pulsing member and splashed his hot cu!m across her exposed bre@sts, collarbones, flushed face, and even her tousled hair.</p>
<p>Dazed and drenched in his cu!m, Jasmine blinked in bewilderment. “Ahh…”</p>
<p>Who would believe that the passionate, audacious man who was spilling his seed all over her was none other than the cold Duke of Aion?</p>
<p>His milky liquid descended from her chest to her navel, a strange and new sight yet intensely arousing. His satisfied, wolfish grin brought a smile to her lips as well.</p>
<p>The pleasure they shared, the rhythmic panting, the trembles in their eyes, the ecstasy when they both came, and the melodic m0ans were overly er0tic. She even liked the sight of their lovemaking. It was crazy.</p>
<p>Richard smiled openly as he kissed her slightly pouted lips. “Shall I take a shower?” He said.</p>
<p>“Are you going to do it again?”</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p><em>‘Liar.’</em> Jasmine glared. Richard gently kissed her forehead and spoke solemnly. On the contrary, he appeared earnest.</p>
<p>“If you wish, I’ll at least make a Knight’s promise.”</p>
<p>“You’re using something so significant for something like this?”</p>
<p>“It’s <em>you</em>. Of course, so what do you think?”</p>
