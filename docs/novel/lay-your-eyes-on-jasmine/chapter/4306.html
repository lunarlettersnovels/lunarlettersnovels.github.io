            <p><strong>Chapter 27.1</strong></p>
<p>When her senses returned, she scolded him like a spoiled child, but Jasmine had nothing to say since she had initiated their tryst herself.</p>
<p>Well, how could she refuse? It was irresistible, she defended against her inner judgment.</p>
<p>But she had done too much. She sighed with some self-reflection. Spending time with him, chatting and sharing hobbies, had been enjoyable, but it was over now. She had been too preoccupied with other matters.</p>
<p>‘<em>Anyway, we are a perfect match in many ways. Isn’t it hard to meet someone like this?’</em> Even without dating experience, this was certain. Jasmine cleared her throat and nodded with a thoughtful expression.</p>
<p>“Lady Liovanni.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Jasmine, who was sipping her tea, suddenly perked up when the Crown Prince called her. She smoothed her expression and smiled. In truth, she was somewhat tired and just wanted to go to her room to catch up on some much-needed sleep.</p>
<p>After all, she knew she would be up late tonight anyway.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Crown Prince didn’t say anything when she overslept. But for some reason, she felt embarrassed and casually glanced at Richard, who was calmly eating on the opposite side.</p>
<p>The two exchanged glances discreetly and continued moving their cutlery.</p>
<p>“You came here out of the blue. Are you enjoying yourself? You seem paler than the first day, and it worries me.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, no. I’m perfectly healthy.”</p>
<p><em>‘Almost too healthy,</em>’ Jasmine muttered to herself.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s good to hear. Your cheeks do seem rosy. Well, aside from looking a bit tired… just in case, make sure to eat well. How can I face the Grand Duke and Duchess if you get sick?”</p>
<p><em>‘My parents could never have dreamed I’d be doing so well.’</em></p>
<p>“I am of age now. I have the right to a private life.”</p>
<p>She looked at Richard, who seemed oddly shameless, with no change in his complexion. He even appeared pious, like a butcher who never closed his shop for a year. That’s when it happened.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Under the table, his leg brushed against hers. At first, she thought it was an accident, but it seemed quite deliberate as it ventured under her skirt. She glanced at him. His mouth curled up ever so slightly. Quite subtly devious.</p>
<p>“I wanted to ask if you’d like to go hunting together. But since it might rain later, let’s postpone it to tomorrow. So, today, rest well.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Richard, what about you?”</p>
<p>“I have no objections.”</p>
<p>This time, Richard’s eyes blatantly locked onto Jasmine. Jasmine swallowed hard.</p>
<p>After the meal and exchanging pleasantries with the nobility, they returned to their rooms. She hurried her steps as if trying to escape the gaze slowly chasing her.</p>
<p>Indeed, she needed some rest today. Her hair, which she had neglected for so long, needed attention. Following her instincts had left everything else neglected.</p>
<p>She stood in front of her door and glanced around. Normally, someone would escort her, but today, it was empty. Although she wanted to rest alone, it felt oddly lonely. She wrinkled her nose in frustration before opening the door.</p>
<p>Her wrist was grabbed as soon as the door opened, and she was pulled inside.</p>
<p>The door slammed shut with a bang, and Richard pressed Jasmine against it. She parted her lips, and Richard gently brushed his lips against hers.</p>
<p>“A private life?” he asked.</p>
<p>In the next moment, their lips met passionately.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>White fingertips grazed the wall. Large hands overlapped hers, softly intertwining their fingers. But the lower part of their bodies was different. Jasmine felt a quick, passionate kiss on the nape of her neck. He left a series of tender kisses, and as their short breaths synchronized, her skin tingled with excitement.</p>
<p>Trembling, she gasped, “G-gently…”</p>
<p>‘<em>If you’re going to be hasty, don’t pretend to be gentle!</em>’ Ignoring her sharp gaze, Richard smiled and left kisses on her flushed cheeks. At the same time, he moved his hips vigorously.</p>
<p>Pressed against the door, Richard pounded into her fast. A sultry desire seemed to pierce through them. Their bodies moved in sync with each deep thrust, filling Jasmine with a satisfying fullness and pleasure that made her mind numb.</p>
<p>Jasmine clung to him, her heels lifted off the ground as he shook her up and down. The soft, pliant flesh of her butt0cks quivered with each motion, and she whimpered softly. Long, graceful fingers flittered across her bosom, teasing her n!pples.</p>
<p>His hand movements were possessive, and Jasmine felt the thrill whenever he did that. She found herself both bewildered and excited by his contrasting behavior, especially when he acted savagely during their encounters and different times in the day.</p>
<p>This man seemed to know how to make her feel embarrassed and flustered, even making her blush more intensely when overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“Ah, gently?”</p>
<p>His husky voice sent shivers down Jasmine’s spine, causing her nose to tingle as she nodded. ‘<em>Yes, yes!’</em></p>
<p>“Like this?”</p>
