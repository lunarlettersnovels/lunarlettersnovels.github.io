            <p><strong>Chapter 34.1</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine looked surprised, and her innocent emotions shone brightly in her wide eyes and flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>Richard wasn’t sure he understood her completely, but he could sense her pure excitement and happiness in her blushing face when he told her how greedy he was for her.</p>
<p>His was filled with relief and joy as he looked at her expression of pure excitement rather than confusion and doubt. He felt light.</p>
<p>If he could see this lovely face every time, he felt he could do anything.</p>
<p>Anything at all. It wasn’t about making audacious promises like guys who say they would catch a star from the sky. It was a different kind of excitement altogether.</p>
<p>Richard chuckled at himself and decided he should hurry up and propose.</p>
<p>Although he had tried to control himself because he didn’t want to be one of those guys who couldn’t control their emotions and burdened their partners with hasty proposals, it became increasingly challenging as time passed.</p>
<p>He felt impatient and wanted to resolve this anxiety as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stand uncertain situations and unstable emotions for long.</p>
<p>Even on the battlefield, he would eliminate the enemy’s leader, chase them to the end, and verify the supply distribution. Everything had to be perfectly handled, even if it meant punishing the distribution team for any mistakes.</p>
<p>He was also the kind of person who would catch thieves and robbers and hold several responsible individuals accountable before enjoying his meal.</p>
<p>He preferred things to be clear and sure rather than confusing. Issues should be resolved decisively rather than untangling intricately twisted strings step by step.</p>
<p>And he had to personally oversee every aspect of this process.  He achieved remarkable success at a young age because of his meticulous and perfectionistic nature hidden within him.</p>
<p>He knew he had been criticized and told to change this aspect of himself many times, but he hadn’t seen a reason to do so. Even the previous duke had such characteristics.</p>
<p>Clearing everything up provided peace of mind.</p>
<p>He noticed that her longing for reassurance was increasing, so his desire for her grew even more intense.</p>
<p>Considering there was an arranged marriage between them, would it be such a big deal?</p>
<p>She probably had similar thoughts back then, so she likely wouldn’t object to adding a marriage proposal. Moreover, their ages were suitable, and everything else fell into place.</p>
<p>Richard poured her a glass of jasmine tea with a steady hand, carefully measuring the water.</p>
<p>He wanted her. He desired her. He wanted everyone to know that she was his.</p>
<p>Was that so wrong?</p>
<p>He could barely restrain himself from kissing her passionately. The moment he imagined her lips parting to receive his kiss and their tongues clash—and her sweet m0an…</p>
<p>He couldn’t think of anything else.</p>
<p>Running his fingers through her hair, from her scalp down to her slender waist, he would gently untie the dress straps concealing her flesh. As her luscious, fair body fell into his hands, it was clear what would follow.</p>
<p>He would explore and indulge in her until she was too overwhelmed to do anything but hang on to him and sob.</p>
<p>Adjusting her ankles and spreading her thighs, he would lick and suck her crimson petals before thrusting his engorged and thick member into her wet vag!na.</p>
<p>The feeling of fu!cking her till her body shook, and her lower body dripped nectar was exquisite. Mindnumbing. His heart pounded with ecstasy and satisfaction in making her succumb.</p>
<p>It was a fullness that transcended mere physical pleasure. Each time he thrust into her gave an exhilarating sense of belonging.</p>
<p>His brain resonated with thrill. It was too affectionate to be called conquering and too greedily animalistic to be considered textbook love.</p>
<p>With each time he possessed her more, the torment and doubt that accompanied such feelings melted away. When he released his desires inside her, she generously opened her door, her white breasts heaving, allowing him to leave nothing untouched.</p>
<p>Richard held her sweaty body, panting, juice-soaked body, and could do nothing but passionately kiss her.</p>
<p>He had never felt such a similar emotion before. That’s why Richard didn’t know how to bring out and express this vicious and strange desire. He still felt that impulse every moment.</p>
<p>“Let’s take a walk.”</p>
<p>Responding appropriately to the cheerful voices of the people congratulating them, Jasmine took his arm and led him.</p>
<p>Her hands were small and delicate. Richard knew very well how her hands had caressed his bare back, how they had clumsily moved when she grasped his manh0od, and how they had eagerly clung to him when they kissed.</p>
<p>He suddenly wanted to kiss her.</p>
<p>However, he was restrained, he only licked her slightly open lips. This restraint, mindful of external eyes, irritated and frustrated him.</p>
<p>If she was already his from the beginning, or even if they were engaged, a simple kiss would be nothing.</p>
<p>Why did I refuse the engagement meeting back then? Wasn’t it better to have her in advance? After all, he was bound to want Jasmine eventually.</p>
<p>As Richard continued his thoughts, he suddenly opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p>The reason he had refused the engagement meeting at the time… the remnants of his broken heart and the presence of someone who had once occupied a corner of his vision were almost forgotten.</p>
<p>It was surprisingly clean. As if all color, temperature, or depth had been wiped away.</p>
