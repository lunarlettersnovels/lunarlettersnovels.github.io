            <h3>Chapter 93.1</h3>
<p>“How many times have I told you to do this kind of thing in the annex? Do you not listen to anything except for your experiments?”</p>
<p>“Ah, be quiet! I’m doing something important right now!”</p>
<p>When Risha snapped back, Richard looked up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, being indoors, all he saw was the dark ceiling. It was cluttered with mathematical formulas that Risha had been writing since childhood and a constellation model she had whimsically installed one day.</p>
<p>Trying to cool his temper only made Richard’s patience wear thinner, and he ground his teeth in frustration.</p>
<p>“I told you not to do this kind of thing in my house.”</p>
<p>Risha, who had a pencil tucked behind her ear but couldn’t find it and was instead scribbling furiously with a new fountain pen, scoffed at her brother’s anger.</p>
<p>“Why is this your house? It’s my house too. Haven’t you seen the will?”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to remove your name from the family register?”</p>
<p>“Wow. Abuse of power.”</p>
<p>Risha muttered in a nonchalant tone. Even Jasmine, meeting her for the first time, thought that her languid attitude had a way of irritating the listener.</p>
<p>Curious, since she had never seen Richard so genuinely annoyed and upset with someone, Jasmine couldn’t resist peeking inside.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaos that looked like a bomb had gone off, she saw a familiar head of silver-gray hair. The piercing blue eyes behind the glasses were intensely focused.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s mouth dropped open in surprise.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Risha, with her sharp senses, immediately turned her gaze to the unfamiliar voice. She let out a confused sound.</p>
<p>“Are you really trying to kick me out, brother?”</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you spouting now?”</p>
<p>Ignoring Richard’s irritation, Risha pointed at the wide-eyed Jasmine with the end of her pencil.</p>
<p>“Did you bring her here to marry her already? Moving fast, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“…I told you not to blurt out whatever comes to mind.”</p>
<p>Richard, whose expression had twisted like a demon’s, spoke in a biting tone, his words clipped. Meanwhile, his ears turned red.</p>
<p>Jasmine was overwhelmed by Risha’s bombshell statement, Richard’s fierce demeanor as if he might fold his sister neatly and throw her out, and the new realization she had upon seeing Risha. Trying to mediate, she stepped inside.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you the person I saw at the old bookstore?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I enjoyed the book.”</p>
<p>Risha raised her eyebrows in greeting. She certainly didn’t seem normal, but she was polite. The contrast was somewhat amusing, and Jasmine finally understood the strange feeling she had when she first saw her.</p>
<p>A face she had never seen in society, an ambiguous status, and a unique atmosphere—all of it made sense now. If she was the famous Risha Aion, that is.</p>
<p>For some reason, Jasmine felt a sense of familiarity seeing Risha for the second time. She smiled slightly and said,</p>
<p>“Your sister is cute. And she’s beautiful. She looks like you, Duke.”</p>
<p>“In what way, exactly?”</p>
<p>“On what grounds are you making such an irrational statement?”</p>
<p>The siblings simultaneously reacted with half-hearted disdain. The contempt and scorn in their eyes as they looked at each other were comical. Jasmine couldn’t help but burst into laughter.</p>
<p>At the sound of her cheerful laughter, the two Aions, who had been glaring daggers at each other, turned to look at Jasmine, who was now giggling like glass marbles rolling. Feeling awkward under their gaze, Jasmine cleared her throat.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry. I just meant that even great Aions are ultimately just ordinary siblings.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that? I don’t quite understand the implication.”</p>
<p>“Risha, if you don’t understand, just sh—be quiet. Your linguistic abilities are on par with a goldfish playing a puzzle game.”</p>
<p>Richard gave a stern rebuke to Risha, who adjusted her glasses with eyes full of genuine curiosity. He always felt a peculiar sense of shame whenever his sister acted in a way that made him question whether she was a genius or a lunatic, but it had never been as intense as it was now.</p>
<p>He wished she wouldn’t act like this, at least in front of Jasmine. But, as expected, Risha never behaved as he wished. She had to ask immediately if she was curious, regardless of context or situation.</p>
<p>“Lady Jasmine, are you dating my brother?”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha. No. Well, how should I put it? We’re more like well-acquainted collaborators.”</p>
<p>To simply call them acquaintances would overlook their shared history, and to call them friends didn’t quite fit either, nor was it purely a platonic relationship. However, if one were to summarize the complex situation, it leaned more towards goodwill.</p>
<p>Jasmine no longer found him merely awkward, uncomfortable, or annoying. Somehow, Risha, noticing Richard’s sudden silence at Jasmine’s straightforward reply, smirked.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way, I visited the bakery you recommended last time. Thank you. It was delicious.”</p>
<p>Jasmine said with a bright smile, and Risha nodded as if it were only natural.</p>
<p>“Interestingly, that bakery uses precise scales to measure the flour and milk. They also use clocks with accurate second hands. There are scientific reasons why their bread is perfect in every way.”</p>
<p>“Really? Hahaha. I see.”</p>
<p>“It’s probably just the skill of the baker.”</p>
<p>Fascinated by this unique personality, Jasmine kept laughing and expressing her amazement, while Richard curtly cut in. He wished Risha would just keep quiet and focus on her work. At least when she was quietly researching, she seemed somewhat respectable. He gestured to redirect her attention.</p>
