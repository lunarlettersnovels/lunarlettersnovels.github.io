            <h3>Chapter 78.1</h3>
<p>“Duke, what about you? I’m really curious.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand what you mean.”</p>
<p>“How are you in private? Have you ever joined in vulgar conversations or spent money on courtesans? I’ve heard many men enjoy such things.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>Richard’s voice was sharp, almost cutting. His demeanor conveyed that the question itself was both shocking and insulting.</p>
<p>“What do you take me for… I have never done anything dishonorable. You know that.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t. I’m not a man, after all.”</p>
<p>Jasmine replied without batting an eye. She appeared nonchalant, merely intrigued, but Richard felt increasingly cornered.</p>
<p>“Such… nonsense. It’s not true. Not at all.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I understand.”</p>
<p>Her teasing tone, met with his unexpectedly fierce denial, made her chuckle. Turning away, she saw Richard muttering half in frustration.</p>
<p>“It’s really not.”</p>
<p>“I said I understand.”</p>
<p>“Jasmine…”</p>
<p>“Haha.”</p>
<p>Jasmine let out a small laugh, surprising even herself. How did the atmosphere become so relaxed? She glanced back, noticing his expression had subtly changed as well. Richard’s gaze lingered on her face, which still bore traces of amusement.</p>
<p>Everywhere his relentless, sticky gaze landed felt as though it left a tangible mark, like lips brushing against skin. Jasmine froze.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he reached out, supporting himself beside her and leaning in close.</p>
<p>This time, it was no illusion.</p>
<p>Their breaths mingled in the air, so close. His eyes seemed pained, thirsty. Perhaps Jasmine could read his heart completely at this moment.</p>
<p>Because she felt the same way.</p>
<p>Just before their lips touched, Jasmine managed to cry out.</p>
<p>“Stop, stop…!”</p>
<p>She backed away hastily, rustling the nearby bushes. The leaves extending to the window shook vigorously. Oh no! Their startled eyes turned to the window where they could hear someone approaching.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear something?”</p>
<p>They’ve been discovered!</p>
<p>As Jasmine inhaled sharply, a large hand clamped over her mouth. In her shocked eyes, she saw Richard raising a finger to his lips, signaling her to be quiet. Calmly and swiftly, he pulled her under his black coat, pressing them close to the bushes.</p>
<p>The ground was soft with grass but slightly cold, causing her to shiver. A large, gentle hand cupped the back of her neck, warming her. Under the black cloak, they exchanged tense glances and breaths in a completely enclosed space.</p>
<p>It was too close. Despite the urgent situation above, she was more preoccupied with his presence, making her breathless.</p>
<p>“What was that, a cat?”</p>
<p>Thanks to Richard’s quick thinking, they seemed to have avoided detection. As an officer muttered while surveying the area, his superior responded.</p>
<p>“That crying cat has been driving me crazy. Sounds like a baby wailing… it’s unnerving.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s cute though.”</p>
<p>The window shut with a thud, and they found themselves staring at each other again. Or perhaps they had been only looking at each other from the start. Richard’s blue eyes, glowing like gemstones, gazed at her intently.</p>
<p>He was like a cat. Eyes slitted in the dark, mysterious and mesmerizing. His eyes half-closed, his breath ghosted over her hair. Jasmine closed her eyes, gripping his arm.</p>
<p>His expression faintly crumbled as he inhaled deeply.</p>
<p>Like a beggar who had smelled freshly baked bread after starving for days, his eyes looked hungry, like an alcoholic craving a drink, his loose mouth tantalizing her. It was an expression she knew well yet didn’t know at all.</p>
<p>He exhaled a harsher breath, slowly lowering his head to bury his nose in her neck.</p>
<p>His hair brushed against her cheek and lips as he nuzzled deeper. It tickled. She wanted to run her fingers through his hair.</p>
<p>He stayed like that, breathing in and out, just staying still. She counted his breaths, feeling the soft touch of his lips brushing ever so slightly against her skin.</p>
<p>Jasmine remembered every sensation those beautiful lips had once given her.</p>
<p>Her hands were trembling. She needed to push him away, but the trembling wouldn’t stop.</p>
<p>Instead, his hands met hers, gently but deliberately. His thumb softly stroked the inside of her wrist and palm, calming her. Only when they were fully intertwined did Jasmine realize that he was trembling just as much as she was.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>His blue eyes, partially hidden beneath his eyelids, were speaking volumes.</p>
<p>I like you so much. I want you. I want to hold you. I want to become one with you.</p>
<p>The moment their eyes met, Jasmine felt a primal thrill course through her body. It was a sensation she hadn’t felt in so long.</p>
<p>It was like a bolt of lightning from her spine to her toes, heating her lower abdomen. She felt hot. She was getting wet. The response was quick, and as always, they both sensed that the other was feeling the same.</p>
<p>The broad shoulders of the beast over her, the muscular torso, were heaving with excitement. Their bodies pressed together so tightly that she could feel every movement. This brought back memories of how his muscles and body had moved over hers in the past.</p>
<p>The muscles of his back rippled like waves, the rhythm of his trunk like a well-toned horse, his firm bu.tto.cks and rock-hard thighs moved rhythmically like a predator on the hunt.</p>
<p>She could feel his body moving slowly and sensuously under her touch, and the wild, masculine presence of his large, heavy body overwhelmed her. His body odor, the sweat-soaked torso, the gleam that led down to the sweat-glistened abs, the dark hair below, and his engorged arousal…</p>
