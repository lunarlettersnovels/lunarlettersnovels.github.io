        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 15.2</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine almost flinched. Even though he didn’t lift a hand, the back of her head felt hot.</p>
<p>She had been on the verge of wiping her cheeks with her hands in her confusion but managed to restrain herself at the last moment. Her nerves were on edge.</p>
<p>He nonchalantly used a simple gesture to push her back into her senses. Even if it wasn’t an intentional act, it felt somewhat threatening to Jasmine, who was easily overpowered by his actions, whether deliberate or unconscious.</p>
<p>So, this was a kind of emotional crisis.</p>
<p>“What is it? If you have something to say, say it.”</p>
<p>With that, she responded more sharply, like an agitated cat. But when Jasmine heard her own voice trembling, she couldn’t help but curl her toes in response. It seemed like he had noticed it too. His pupils dilated as he stared down at her, like a wolf lowering its head.</p>
<p>She recoiled slightly, looking even more defensive, like a prey animal. Her widened, frightened eyes quivered.</p>
<p>Richard, who had some experience in dealing with her, instinctively sensed her shifting emotions. It was as if a predator had caught the scent of blood and was circling its surroundings.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, Richard’s long, relaxed fingers lightly brushed against hers. The transparent purple eyes, which had momentarily shifted downward, quickly returned to her gaze.</p>
<p>His voice, for some reason, softened.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not. How about you head back to your room to relax? I’m sure the Crown Prince will bother the Lady later in the evening.”</p>
<p>“Bother, you say?”</p>
<p>No matter how he and Jilian were close as if they were as cousins, it was quite rude to speak so casually about the crown prince that way.</p>
<p>Jasmine, a high-ranking noble, furrowed her brow at Richard’s words. Richard just grinned, seemingly in a much better mood now.</p>
<p>“May I escort you, Lady Liovanni?”</p>
<p>He extended his hand politely but didn’t take a single step towards her. He stood there as if waiting for his prey to come to him, without a single movement.</p>
<p>Although it was a customary gesture for a well-mannered gentleman, Jasmine felt an odd shiver down her spine. She hesitated for a moment, thinking, “Why am I feeling like this?” It irritated her.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment and then decided she just wanted to get back to her room as quickly as possible. She didn’t realize that her heightened emotional state was clouding her judgment.</p>
<p>As she reached out her hand hesitantly, Richard, standing like a patient hunter waiting for his prey to approach, gently took her hand. She felt a strange thrill, despite the customary nature of his action. She was irritated and wondered why she was suddenly so conscious of it.</p>
<p>Richard, who had entered her personal space without her realizing, held her small, white hand in his. It was warm and soft, like a lily leaf in spring.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to Jasmine, her first response to his low voice caused her cheeks to flush. It was as if his voice resonated loudly in close quarters.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time she had heard him use that tone, but for some reason, it sent shivers down her spine, as if it were ringing out loudly in close quarters.</p>
<p>“It seems you’ve packed lightly. This region has many forests and lakes, so it’s wise to bring spare clothes for a casual outing. Didn’t your lover tell you?”</p>
<p>“It’s just a half-day trip; I don’t need spare clothes.”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s irritation about the misunderstandings slipped out once again, this time openly. She couldn’t help but comment on the situation.</p>
<p>“Is that so? But even Charles wouldn’t have thought I’d need spare clothes. And besides, we’re not even lovers, I mean, just for a while. Why am I explaining this to the Duke?”</p>
<p>She kept on talking, but it felt like she was making excuses, so she cut herself off with an annoyed look. All this time, she had been feeling self-reproach for even getting into this fake relationship in the first place. High society was known for this kind of thing, and she had momentarily forgotten.</p>
<p>Richard, his eyes still fixed on her, reached out and lightly touched the back of her hand. It was a subtle gesture, and it caught Jasmine off guard. She blinked, unsure of how to react.</p>
<p>“What’s with all these discussions about your nonexistent relationship?”</p>
<p>She challenged him, her eyes locked on his. She knew her way around high society, but she hadn’t expected such intense scrutiny. It was as if she had been foolish from the very beginning.</p>
<p>As Richard continued to look at her, he casually brushed his thumb over the back of her hand. It was a gentle touch that made Jasmine feel a bit uneasy, but she didn’t pull away.</p>
<p>“Why are we even talking about this?”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s eyes narrowed, her irritation showing. She might not have much experience with romance, but she understood high society’s reputation game.</p>
<p>Seeing her react strongly, Richard spoke calmly, “I apologize for assuming. I heard some rumors circulating in social circles and thought you might be enjoying our time together. My mistake.”</p>
<p>“Rumors are already spreading?”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s irritation was clear. She might not have experience with romantic relationships, but she was well-versed in managing her reputation in high society.</p>
<p>Richard pointed out, “It’s not widespread, and those who know are likely to be discreet.”</p>
<p>“It’s ridiculous. They live so freely and indulgently, and they make a big deal out of me having a few sips of wine.”</p>
<p>She added with frustration, “I haven’t even kissed anyone yet!” Her attempt at romance had ended in failure, and she felt unjustly upset about it.</p>
<p>But she realized that her annoyance might be mostly because of the man beside her. She had come to understand that she’d look like a fool next to his immaculate appearance.</p>
