            <h3><strong>Chapter 54.1</strong></h3>
<p>“It’s like he wants to return the goods he bought. What the heck? Buying goods for a marriage? He should never do that! If your father finds out about this, he’ll be furious. Even though he’s a duke, he shouldn’t underestimate Liovanni, should he? Jasmine, you need to be furious. He’s looking down on this so casually. That da!mn bastard!”</p>
<p>As expected of a young artist. Aisha was passionate and hot-tempered even when speaking.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t even know if he loves you, but just because he likes you, that’s enough reason to propose within a week of meeting? I understand if you initially refused the marriage proposal. But this is too much! Even if he knew his feelings clearly, out of courtesy, he should have been embarrassed to propose to you! Seriously, wow! Is he acting that way just because he’s the Emperor’s nephew?!”</p>
<p>Aisha pounded her fists on the table, getting angrier by the second. Nikki, whose anger was rising with the beat, also shouted:</p>
<p>“Just because he’s the duke and the nephew of the Emperor!? He thinks he’s sooo handsome! In most cases, maybe—but not in this one!”</p>
<p>Jasmine awkwardly laughed, caught between the imperial top perfumer and the portrait master spewing curses. It was refreshing and touching how her friends took her side, although her ears were sore. Still, she felt relieved to have confided in them.</p>
<p>It seemed like Duke Aion was turning into complete trash, but at the same time, she also thought, ‘What am I doing? I feel conflicted. Did I say wrong?’</p>
<p>She didn’t know. Her feelings were complicated, but it was better than worrying alone.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s what ‘he’ Duke Richard Aion said.”</p>
<p>From start to finish, Lichang listened without wavering, only raising her eyebrows or twitching them slightly at some points. Among the enraged sisters, she maintained the most composure. With her arms crossed, the corners of her seductive mouth drew a subtle line.</p>
<p>“This story is really interesting.”</p>
<p>While fanning herself and laughing like the classy witch she was, she narrowed her drowsy eyes and tilted her head towards Jasmine.</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“What do you want to do?”</p>
<p>‘At this point, your opinion is the most important,’ Lichang’s smile seemed to say.</p>
<p>Even the sisters who were passionately chewing on Duke Aion like Chihuahuas stopped their fervent talk and looked at Jasmine with lowered eyes.</p>
<p>Jasmine bit her tongue, lost in thought. What does she want to do?</p>
<p>Actually, she already made a decision. She was a kind-hearted, noble, uncommonly generous people-pleaser who rarely changed her mind.</p>
<p>Even if it took her a long time to decide, she doesn’t look back once she has decided. Even if she was cheerful and bright—having grown up with nothing but love and without any worries—she was precise and decisive in her actions.</p>
<p>Without this aspect, she couldn’t have maintained a clean reputation in the tumultuous social circles. So many people coveted her family, status, wealth, beauty, and popularity.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was natural for her to keep her relationships in order from an early age.</p>
<p>Even if she had a crush on Richard for a long time, it was just one of many relationships, and rightfully so. No matter how frightening and powerful her feelings were, he wasn’t family; it was not a legal marriage.</p>
<p>‘Maybe we weren’t even lovers. Only in a few days a week…’</p>
<p>Jasmine chuckled somewhat self-deprecatingly and cynically.</p>
<p>But maybe the length of their tryst or the short, intense waves of emotion prevented her from saying anything difficult like: ‘I don’t want to cut it off,’ or ‘I want it to be over.’</p>
<p>She didn’t know how the harsh words came out fine when she turned her back on him.</p>
<p>The fact that her friends were criticizing Richard added to her mixed emotions. Knowing she had loyal allies ready to support her was comforting. Yet, deep down, she couldn’t shake off the unease lingering within her.</p>
<p>Jasmine sighed and answered after a long time. “I told him it was over.”</p>
<p>“Well done!”</p>
<p>“That’s right! A guy like that needs to experience rejection at least once.”</p>
<p>The faces of her two friends cheering like madmen were like an excited squirrel and poodle. It was somewhat amusing, so Jasmine chuckled, and Lichang, who carefully examined her, asked.</p>
<p>“That was the rational decision. But looking at your expression, you seem to think that decision was wrong. Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>At the sharp question, Jasmine blinked and slowly nodded her head. Perhaps it was because of Lichang’s accumulated experience, but at times, she seemed like a noble lady in her 50s who had endured many hardships.</p>
<p>“Yes, you’re right.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then you did well.”</p>
<p>At the refreshing reply, Jasmine smiled. But her expression wasn’t very cool.</p>
<p>“You’ve tried dating that man, even if it was short-lived. You confessed your feelings, experienced heartbreak, and even sought advice. In the end, you walked away from it all. You’ve done everything.”</p>
