            <p><strong>Chapter 24.1</strong></p>
<p>On the bed, they were intertwined, their bodies fitting together perfectly. As his large hand kneaded her soft breast, Jasmine’s violet eyes grew hazy.</p>
<p>The faint tremors that had started surged through her. Despite mixing and swallowing saliva, her mouth felt parched. The heat of his slick manhood against her form intensified as they met each other’s gaze.</p>
<p>Lovemaking under the bright morning light felt incredibly natural.</p>
<p>As he gently entered between her slightly parted legs, Jasmine let out a soft m*an. Richard, with furrowed brows, groaned in response. They continued to kiss slowly, their lips and tongues dancing as their breaths synchronized.</p>
<p>Even with a slow entry, his desire was strong and commanding. She felt pleasure mingled with a dull ache as he penetrated her deep.</p>
<p>Richard’s lips descended on her slightly furrowed brow. As they tasted each other, their bodies moved in sync. Jasmine, feeling a sense of fullness in her lower region, clung to his broad back.</p>
<p>It all felt as vivid as their first night together.</p>
<p>The sensation of his firm, pulsating member spreading her intimate folds. Their bodies in an intense union, her limbs wrapped around him like ivy as his weight pressed on her. His rugged breath and piercing gaze as he delved deep inside her hot, tight walls.</p>
<p>Above all, the deliberate, slow movement of his manh0od, sliding against her wet walls and electrifying her mind and body, left her breathless. His c0ck stretched her tight entrance, withdrawing slightly, before plunging back in.</p>
<p>The pleasure almost drove Jasmine to tears. With half-lidded eyes, she watched the man above her as her breath came in short pants.</p>
<p>He seemed to be faintly smiling. His strong hand gently stroked her dampened brow, then interlaced their fingers. He slid deeply into her once more.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Her inner folds clamped on him sweetly. His muscles, and his smooth, sweat-slicked skin brushed against her own. It was all too intense, too vivid.</p>
<p>Jasmine parted her lips, unsure if she wanted him to slow down or speed up, maybe go even deeper. She couldn’t decide.</p>
<p>Before she could voice her embarrassing plea, his smooth lips descended upon hers. Naturally, Jasmine forgot the words she had intended to say and welcomed his kiss eagerly.</p>
<p>Caught up in the kiss, Richard slipped his hand between her thighs and lifted her leg. Just as his upper body seemed to withdraw slightly, he thrusted inside, causing Jasmine to gasp and her back to bend.</p>
<p>Her shaky violet eyes met his intense blue ones.</p>
<p>“How do you like it this time?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Can you see me now?”</p>
<p>With her legs spread wide, he was able to penetrate her even more deeply than before, hitting a sweet spot inside her. Her body trembled and her mounds swayed with the rhythm. In and out. The wet slapping of their intertwined lower bodies echoed tantalizingly.</p>
<p>Jasmine couldn’t control her cries at the intense stimulation, while Richard continued his intense thrusts with an engrossed expression. He squeezed her breast and his long fingers teased and flicked her sensitive n!pples, making her jolt and m8an.</p>
<p>Her toes curled, and her nectar flowed freely. The scent of their lovemaking filled the air. Richard’s thick and stiff manhood relentlessly pounded on her below.</p>
<p>“R-Richard… ah, ahh!”</p>
<p>“Hmm.. can you see?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes! Ah!”</p>
<p>Richard licked her cheek as she m0aned loudly. He whispered in her ear, “Jasmine… look closely.”</p>
<p>“Who is f*cking you right now?”</p>
<p>“Ah! Richard! Ah!”</p>
<p>She moaned as he whispered, and the bed creaked and shook. The morning light illuminated his sweat-covered upper body brightly and their intertwined figures. Jasmine was on the verge of dizziness as embarrassment and excitement overwhelmed her.</p>
<p>With hazy eyes, she stared at their joined bodies. Richard held her waist firm as he thrust harder like a relentless beast.</p>
<p><em>Insane. It’s insane! This is to-too er0tic!</em></p>
<p>Jasmine gasped and averted her eyes. Richard, still thrusting relentlessly inside her, leaned closer to her face with a smile. It was mischievous and crooked, almost a smirk. Jasmine realized that he was intentionally being naughty.</p>
<p>His character was subtly wicked, indeed. His seductive and sensual look was unlike the usual stoic Richard. Jasmine couldn’t help but be entranced as she watched him.</p>
<p>She leaned in and kissed his lips.</p>
<p>Richard’s eyes widened slightly, and he smiled as if a beast were turning into a prince. He caressed her face and tasted her mouth in reply. They now faced each other, and Jasmine wrapped her legs around his waist. The closeness of their bodies and this new position made her wet walls clench around him.</p>
<p>They were consumed with each other. Jasmine bobbed up and down on his hips, moaning loudly for people to hear. Jasmine loved the feel of his rough breathing and his sweat-slicked flesh rubbing against her skin.</p>
<p>This vivid expression of the unreachable Duke Richard, utterly different from anyone she had ever seen, was irresistibly captivating. Strangely, as imperfect faces were revealed, she felt an even stronger attraction and was drawn helplessly.</p>
