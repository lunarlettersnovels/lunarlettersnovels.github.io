            <h3>Chapter 90.1</h3>
<p>Jasmine went to bed with a slightly restless and complicated mind. Richard, Marian, Soyer, the drugs, the suspicious military doctor… nothing was simple. So much had happened in just one day.</p>
<p>Fatigue washed over her, and after tossing and turning for a bit, she quickly fell into a deep sleep. When she suddenly opened her eyes, it was morning. She couldn’t help but be impressed by her own resilience.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Stretching languidly, she removed her pink sleep mask and slowly slipped into her slippers. She yawned again as she pulled the cord to open the curtains. Wow, I slept without dreaming at all.</p>
<p>No matter how chaotic things are, a good night’s sleep is essential.</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>Resting her chin on her hand, Jasmine sighed deeply. What should she say to Marian? There was no concrete evidence, but the scene she witnessed yesterday was suspicious to anyone.</p>
<p>As she pondered, she realized she needed to approach the situation delicately, considering Marian’s current state.</p>
<p>Jasmine couldn’t decide which was worse: infidelity or drug addiction.</p>
<p>Feeling a bit melancholic, she thought she should write to Richard and ask him about the situation. Although their relationship was still somewhat ambiguous, he was the only reliable person she could turn to for help. …And trustworthy, too. She sighed deeply again, just as her maid, Mari, came running in.</p>
<p>“Miss! Miss!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m awake. I’m hungry, so bring me breakfast first.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not the issue right now. You have a visitor!”</p>
<p>“A visitor?”</p>
<p>Who would visit so early in the morning without prior notice? Could it be someone from an urgent investment opportunity? That seemed unlikely. Jasmine’s displeasure was evident, and Mari spoke cautiously.</p>
<p>“Miss… it’s still morning, but it’s almost noon.”</p>
<p>Jasmine paused and looked at the clock. The hands pointed to 11 o’clock. She had overslept. It was hard to blame the visitor for arriving at such an early hour. She sighed heavily and got up to wash.</p>
<p>“Ugh, what a bother. But who is it? Someone from the Southern Trading Company?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s the Duke of Aion.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s head snapped around, and Mari flinched at her sharp gaze, offering an awkward smile.</p>
<p>“It’s Duke Richard Aion. He’s waiting in the drawing room.”</p>
<p>Jasmine stood frozen for a moment before dashing into the bathroom. Looking at herself in the mirror, she saw her cheeks flushed with surprise, her eyes wide awake. It felt surreal, but it was reality.</p>
<p>Richard came? This early in the morning?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>A visit before noon usually indicated something urgent or a very close relationship, neither of which seemed to apply here.</p>
<p>Although there had been marriage talks in the past, they had fallen through, so officially, there was no reason for Richard to visit her house, especially not at such an early hour. Could it be that he had discovered something new about yesterday’s events?</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, this was Richard’s first visit to her home.</p>
<p>It felt so unfamiliar and strange.</p>
<p>Jasmine snapped out of her daze and hurriedly patted her cheeks to regain her composure. She couldn’t keep someone waiting outside indefinitely, especially when she was curious about why he had come.</p>
<p>Unlike her usual quick wash, she thoroughly washed her hair and body, then meticulously chose her outfit, muttering to herself. Why does it feel like I have nothing to wear today?</p>
<p>Had she been too frugal with her shopping lately? She held a pink indoor dress against her body but quickly discarded it, thinking it was too pink. After much deliberation, she opted for a simple light purple silk dress and initially styled her hair in a half-updo, but it felt too formal, so she let it down naturally.</p>
<p>She applied a subtle tint to her lips and lightly touched up her eyes before stepping out of her room, only to realize it was already a bit past noon. Feeling guilty for making him wait for about an hour, Jasmine hurried down to the drawing room.</p>
<p>She stopped short when she saw him standing with his back to her.</p>
<p>Dressed in a light semi-formal suit, Richard stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at a portrait hanging in the hall. Sunlight streaming through the window highlighted his dark hair and tall frame, casting a short shadow.</p>
<p>How strange. Seeing him in her familiar home was surreal.</p>
<p>Slowly approaching, Jasmine stopped a step away from Richard and realized he was looking at a painting of her as a child. She gave a short, artificial cough.</p>
<p>“I looked pretty awful, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>Richard turned around, seemingly startled, which was unlike him. Despite having seen him just the night before, he looked different in the daylight.</p>
<p>A few strands of his neatly combed hair had fallen across his pale, clean face. Jasmine covertly scanned his simple yet elegant attire and grumbled to herself. Does he have an appointment or something? Why does he look so stylish even in something so simple?</p>
<p>He was always a man who drew the gaze of women, regardless of what he wore, but the Richard she had recently reconnected with seemed to take more care in his appearance.</p>
<p>As the hero of a swift victory, his honor had grown, and with it, his demeanor had changed. His eyes had deepened, and the man who once only sought neatness now displayed a sense of fashion that stood out. It was true that the social circles’ calls of admiration for him had increased.</p>
