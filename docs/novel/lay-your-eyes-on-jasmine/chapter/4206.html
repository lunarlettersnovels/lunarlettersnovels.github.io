            <h3>Chapter 77.1</h3>
<p>“Shh!”</p>
<p>When she placed her white finger on his lips, Richard blinked and fell silent, obedient like a black Doberman. Jasmine leaned her ear towards the window, prompting Richard to crouch beside her, folding his long legs. He flinched as their shoulders touched. When he rustled noisily, Jasmine shot him a sharp look and shushed him again. Richard stiffened like a sentry and focused on breathing quietly.</p>
<p>Voices floated in from the window.</p>
<p>“The weather’s perfect for a nap today.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare even think about slacking off.”</p>
<p>“Come on, even you must be feeling drowsy, Lieutenant.”</p>
<p>“Get more coffee.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Listening quietly, Jasmine pursed her lips. It seemed Soyer was out, and only his aides were present.</p>
<p>She considered leaving but decided to stay, hoping for useful information. After all, gossip tends to flourish when the boss is away. Sure enough, Soyer became the topic of their conversation.</p>
<p>“Where’s the commander?”</p>
<p>“He went to the infirmary for a bit.”</p>
<p>“He’s been going there a lot lately. Is he having headaches?”</p>
<p>“Seems like he’s not sleeping well.”</p>
<p>A tapping sound on the table was heard.</p>
<p>“Could he be fighting with his wife again?”</p>
<p>“Haha, again? What’s it about this time?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? They’ll probably make up soon anyway.”</p>
<p>Jasmine sighed at the lighthearted remark. Only this couple could turn their passionate love and fights into the biggest scandal in the Empire’s social circles within just six months.</p>
<p>“It’s enviable in a way. The commander is quite the romantic, don’t you think? They must still be in love to fight so much. I barely exchange five words with my wife in a week.”</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s practically living apart, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“That’s arranged marriage for you.”</p>
<p>“Well, even love marriages get dull after decades. The commander’s exceptional.”</p>
<p>“No kidding. I’d be too tired for that kind of drama.”</p>
<p>They chuckled and continued chatting. Jasmine frowned. There was no new information. If there was an affair at work, wouldn’t they have noticed? Deep in thought, Jasmine didn’t realize Richard was reaching towards her.</p>
<p>His long fingers gently touched Jasmine’s forehead.</p>
<p>Ah. Jasmine’s surprised eyes met Richard’s close gaze. The scent of tea leaves on his breath mixed with his refreshing body scent, creating an intoxicating blend. Instinctively, their eyes fell on each other’s lips.</p>
<p>But the heat in his blue eyes cooled as he closed them momentarily and then pulled away.</p>
<p>He had merely brushed a leaf from her golden hair.</p>
<p>“There was something on you.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Jasmine smiled awkwardly, thanking him while tugging at her skirt, feeling foolish for thinking he might kiss her. It felt like she had misread the situation.</p>
<p>Why did she expect a kiss just because the mood felt right?</p>
<p>Before the awkwardness could grow, Richard spoke.</p>
<p>“Now, may I ask why we’re doing this?”</p>
<p>Oh, right. This situation did seem odd. It looked like they were spying, and in a state building, no less.</p>
<p>Jasmine scratched her head in embarrassment. As she pondered, she noticed Richard’s knees were dirty with grass and soil from crouching. Why did she suddenly remember how easily he knelt before her half a year ago? Half on impulse, she asked,</p>
<p>“Can you swear on your honor that you won’t tell anyone or even hint at what I’m about to say?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I didn’t need a promise to keep your confidence, but yes, I swear.”</p>
<p>The immediate response was not only satisfying but also clear. Given his propensity for honesty in such matters, she knew he was sincere. Jasmine regarded Richard with a curious expression.</p>
<p>“And what do you think I’m going to say?”</p>
<p>“You mentioned it was a personal matter first.”</p>
<p>“…And if this personal matter ends up causing harm to you or the military?”</p>
<p>Richard looked at her quietly, his gaze warm yet seemingly amused, with a hint of affection that made her feel strange.</p>
<p>“Because you’re not the type of person to do that. As a noble, you detest disgraceful actions. I know better than anyone that you wouldn’t do anything against the interests of the state.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It was an inexplicable trust, akin to the solid confidence Jasmine had in her understanding of Richard from observing him over time. Her fingers itched, and she frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“…Alright. Since the Duke is trustworthy, I’ll be straightforward. Consider this my thanks for overlooking my actions.”</p>
