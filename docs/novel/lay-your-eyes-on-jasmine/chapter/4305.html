            <p><strong>Chapter 27.2</strong></p>
<p>A swift turn of his waist, followed by a probing gesture inside her, caused an overwhelming sensation. She bit her trembling lip, trying not to m0an. But he already noticed her ar0usal as she continued to whimper and emit sensu0us sounds, her body releasing its desires.</p>
<p>“Or perhaps here?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no! Not there…”</p>
<p>“Where? You need to be clearer in your words.”</p>
<p><em>You’re lying! You know everything! </em>It was torturous how he teased her, pushing her to the brink of ecstasy. His mischievous laughter when she kicked and squirmed like an innocent child made her feel even more helpless.</p>
<p>Having spent the past few days mastering every aspect of her body, he now knew exactly how to make her cry out in pleasure, make him cling to him as if her life depended on it, her pupils dilating with desire.</p>
<p>Richard enjoyed seeing the usually composed and mature Jasmine lose herself in pleasure, overwhelmed by her instincts, unable to hold back her tears.</p>
<p>He pushed her to the limit, spreading her legs wide open while pinning her hands. Nectar dripped from her trembling body. So wet and so sweet. It was the body he tamed and created.</p>
<p>He was a little dumbfounded, but it intoxicated him and gave him a sense of ecstasy and satisfaction. He didn’t even realize he had this side inside of him.</p>
<p>Contrary to his usual appearance, Richard preferred to be a tyrant in bed, like a conqueror in sports or hunting. It was purely a s3xual preference, separate from his intellectual pursuits.</p>
<p>Her body was everything he desired, from head to toe. Sensitivity, enthusiasm, honesty turned him on, and her robust lib!do and physical stamina only added to his satisfaction.  Even their rough lovemaking and her cries during climax were intoxicating.</p>
<p>When her fair butt0cks, enticing br3asts, and graceful spine arched and trembled. He couldn’t resist thrusting deep into her and cumm!ing on her flushed, warm skin.</p>
<p>The white fluid sprayed on her pretty body was a wonderful and l3wd sight. Richard used to imagine her soaking wet from hair to toe. And he became h0rny just from that thought.</p>
<p>He was completely blinded by lust. He had never experienced anything like it before.</p>
<p>He also thought he was going too far. He had planned to take it easy for the day. But when he saw Jasmine sneakily running away, his inner beast emerged as if provoked.</p>
<p>Before he could regain his composure, his body had already chased after hers, capturing her and fulfilling his desires. As he kissed her and pressed her against the wall, he couldn’t tell if they were acting like beasts or humans anymore.</p>
<p>The fact that he had no intention of stopping was the biggest problem.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah! Yes! Oh!”</p>
<p>“Ha, you said you wouldn’t…”</p>
<p>‘<em>Why are you trying to escape? Who’s in control here</em>?’ He growled, brushing aside her golden locks and leaving marks on her neck. He had no idea what he was muttering, his actions were purely instinctual.</p>
<p>He turned his hips and pounded into her. His thick member thrusting in and out of her produced a slick and obsc3ne sound that echoed in the room.</p>
<p>As his wet balls met with her butt0cks, Jasmine m0aned softly. Her posture, with her hips pushed forward like an animal in heat, was shameful… but exhilarating.</p>
<p>“You, you’re doing too much of this… Ah!”</p>
<p>“So you don’t like it?”</p>
<p>“No, no! Ah, harder!”</p>
<p>Just a few minutes ago, they were kissing wildly, she guided his hands down her skirt. He fiddles with the strap of her panties. She was eager and couldn’t help it.</p>
<p>But Richard, he was doing so well. He skillfully eased the tension, slowing down and setting the mood like a snake slithering over a wall.</p>
<p>“Ah, I can’t…”</p>
<p>“Why, are you tired?”</p>
<p>“Just a bit…”</p>
<p>“But why are you wet?”</p>
<p>He crawled beneath her skirt, kissed her moist thigh with his lips, and licked her fragrant skin with the tip of his tongue. Jasmine’s body tensed when he slid his index and middle fingers over her damp panties, and she hurriedly crossed her legs.</p>
<p>However, Richard calmly lifted her dress further, caressing her soft lower abdomen and navel with his tongue. With his fingertips standing upright, he gently teased her damp cr0tch. An intense wave of pleasure threatened to sweep her away like a lightning bolt through her brain, almost causing her legs to give way.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Why are you wet?”</p>
<p>“Please, don’t ask…”</p>
<p><em>‘It’s because of you.’ </em>Jasmine clutched his forearm with her nails, while Richard, satisfied, stood up and held her in his arms. She didn’t collapse despite her legs trembling and body shivering with exhaustion, she didn’t collapse.</p>
<p>It was because his strong, dangerous hand was gripping her lower region firmly and exploring it shamelessly. As he watched her face transform into a l3wd expression, Richard pulled down his waistband.</p>
<p>Seeing his firm and eager member fling up, Jasmine futilely attempted to resist.</p>
<p>“Um, maybe we should have some tea first…”</p>
<p>“We just had some.”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
