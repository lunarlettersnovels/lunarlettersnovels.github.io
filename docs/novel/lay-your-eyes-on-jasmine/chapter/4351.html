            <p><b>Chapter 4.1</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of words are these? However, unlike James, she seemed to know from Richard’s careful choice of words and tightly clenched fingers that what he was about to say wasn’t of the romantic sort she desired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Especially in matters as crucial as this. Perhaps it’s because I’m an inadequate and useless man. However, it’s right to face this responsibly, not avoid it, for Lord Liovanni’s honor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine blinked her eyes absentmindedly. Her hand, hidden under the table, was now trembling. She had berated herself for being foolish countless times. She knew what was coming after such a long preamble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Already, he rejected her twice, no, several times. For seven years, with countless glances and actions, he turned her heart away hundreds of times. And just a few days ago, she had been trampled underfoot like a worthless bouquet. Yet, here it was again, so overt, so brutally firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When fixing her dress and makeup to come here, Jasmine thought she was ready to give him up. But she hadn’t prepared to be rejected so thoroughly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no need to. Because she had already grasped his intentions very well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This handsome man had an exceptional ability to make Jasmine’s existence utterly insignificant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I have to say is…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s about the marriage proposal circulating between families.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please. I already know.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve already conveyed it through letters, but I thought it would be proper to say it face-to-face…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proper or not, it’s unnecessary. Please don’t. I don’t want to hear it.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She covered her ears and shouted in her mind, but in reality, Jasmine was frozen stiff like ice. So, as hard as she tried, she couldn’t reject his offer with the elegance and grace she had painstakingly practiced. Now, she was angry, not only at herself but also at the man before her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…so it’s not suitable to form a connection. It’s all due to my inadequacies. I apologize, Lady.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All your fault?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a good thing to hear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ha.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bitter laugh escaped her lips. As Jasmine began to chuckle wryly, Richard’s eyebrows, which had been calm until now, rose. Such a laugh was almost insolent; naturally, it wasn’t a response befitting a lady of society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Jasmine didn’t care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time, instead of looking up to him, she felt annoyed… and unfortunate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Duke Aion… He might look like a gentleman on the surface… but honestly, sometimes he’s frustrating and not without fault, don’t you agree?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jasmine used to listen and defend him, but now she understood. “True… the duke is certainly well-mannered.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m unfortunate.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her temper, which had been dormant for seven years, burst out. She mentally poured out her complaints, sharpening her tongue.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who proposed again? Did I cling to you? Did I even pretend to be a woman like that? What’s lacking about me other than my one-sided crush on you?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You didn’t need to confirm this all over again.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was already considering giving up.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard’s actions were no different from adding salt to a wound, the way a defeated loser would cling and rub salt on her face. At least, that’s how it felt to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From his perspective, a woman who appeared here with the excuse of a ball could have lingering attachments to him. If he thought that way, there was no argument. It was her fault for not detaching himself sooner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this formal announcement wasn’t necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have been better to ignore it and move on like usual. That would have been the best consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no use trying to keep up a dignified façade with a forced smile. As Richard observed Jasmine’s face filled with scorn and anger, he slightly wrinkled his brow and pressed his lips together as if in discomfort. He softly clicked his tongue and sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems I’ve misunderstood. I apologize.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“……”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I merely…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard trailed off at the end of his sentence. Regrettably, even now, he found himself lost in thought. In truth, under normal circumstances, Richard might not have gone as far as saying these words to Jasmine. However, perhaps he saw a glimmer of his sentiments reflected in her smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suddenly remembered his conversation with Lily.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Richard, I’m getting married soon.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an announcement—a beige envelope, neat and elegant, resembling her, containing a portrait of a newlywed couple. An indescribable emotion welled up in his chest. Richard thought he had given up, but not every trace of feeling for her had faded away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite his inner turmoil, she smiled softly. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he had wished her. He hoped for his happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His response was correct; as expected, she blushed shyly and delighted. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. Be sure to come to my wedding. You will, won’t you?”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re friends, after all.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what his cruel yet beautiful Lily said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With slender fingers, she held his face and kissed Richard on the cheek. Richard remained a faithful friend to Lily until the end. But as he watched her receding figure, a new question arose in his mind for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did Lily’s kindness, affection, and friendship toward him lead to a good outcome for him?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps from the beginning, all these glittering things had accumulated like poison for him. It might have been better if he had been more ruthless and detached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things might have been easier if she were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why he showed Jasmine that unnecessary and impolite firmness. That was his intention.</span></p>
