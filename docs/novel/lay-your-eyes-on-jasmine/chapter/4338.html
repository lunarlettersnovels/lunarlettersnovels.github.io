            <p><strong>Chapter 11.1</strong></p>
<p>After dusting off her hands, Jasmine gracefully passed by her bewildered father and older brothers, heading to her room. As she closed the door behind her, she settled into a chair, crossed her arms, and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>In the past few days, she had been trying to objectively analyze the recent events, her interactions with that man, and her current emotions. It seemed quite straightforward. Richard had attempted to assist her when she was intoxicated and unable to face him. In her inebriated state, she ended up losing her temper in front of a gentleman like him.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, even if she had resisted his help and expressed her irritation at his persistence, it all boiled down to that. Was it frustrating? Absolutely. Was it embarrassing? Without a doubt.</p>
<p>But there was a difference between feeling annoyed and being genuinely angry. Irritated? Definitely. Embarrassed? Certainly. However, the surge of anger she was currently experiencing was something else entirely. It might be irrational, but she felt like smacking the back of that man’s head like she did with her teddy bear and running away if she could. Why was she so irate and angry? It was bubbling up inside her.</p>
<p>“Frustrating.”</p>
<p>Oddly enough, it had initially seemed like losing control might be a relief, but now she was angry enough that it felt like she might lose control again. How could these extreme emotions coexist? It was intriguing, and that man’s influence on her was undeniably remarkable.</p>
<p>“What? Concerned about my reputation?”</p>
<p>A faint grin crept onto her lips.</p>
<p>Why had she ended up falling for such an unlucky fellow? She resented herself for it, but the answer was clear: because he was unattainable. It was oddly impressive. Maybe there was even a hint of admiration mixed in…</p>
<p>“Ha, seriously…”</p>
<p>It was a dark chapter in her history. She was determined to forget it. Did he think she couldn’t forget one person like him? Jasmine felt self-assured. Even though her infatuation had persisted for seven years, if she was indeed a modern empowered woman of this era, she shouldn’t dwell on the past! Besides, he was just a man!</p>
<p>After three days of seething anger, Jasmine fully embraced her role as a social elite, confidently attending balls and parties as the belle of the ball.</p>
<p>In the past, the party’s quality, her image, her demeanor, and, most importantly, whether Duke Aion would be present were all factors that determined her participation. But now, none of that mattered. She simply enjoyed the parties for their entertainment value, whether they seemed fun or piqued her interest, or even just to fend off boredom.</p>
<p>Was it the burning anger that fueled her or her deliberate decision to have fun? Regardless, Jasmine’s already stunning appearance blossomed even further.</p>
<p>Every man’s gaze was drawn to her radiant presence, and the new makeup techniques and dresses she experimented with sparked a fresh wave of fashion trends among the ladies.</p>
<p>As she paraded through and mingled in this society, confidently asserting her mastery over every aspect of it, Jasmine undeniably stood at the center of the social scene, much like a queen.</p>
<p>The royal princesses had little interest in society, and even the empress was the same. That was probably why there were no young ladies among the nobility who could rival Jasmine. Childish as it may sound, Jasmine was quite content.</p>
<p>For the first time, aside from her unrequited love, she focused on other things and found it quite enjoyable. <em>Why did I live so blandly before? Did I need to act like that model student just because he did?</em></p>
<p>In reality, Jasmine hadn’t even experienced romance until now!</p>
<p>Naturally, her friends belatedly welcomed her newfound awakening.</p>
<p>“Jasmine! You’ve finally grown up! Yeah! What do you want to try first? Want me to introduce you to some guys?”</p>
<p>Aisha, the leading painter in the capital, and a fellow foster sister, grabbed Jasmine’s hands and shouted. She had fled from home to study abroad, and now she was a fervent portrait artist recognized as the top in the empire. She even painted portraits of the imperial family.</p>
<p>Thanks to her, she defied her family’s opposition to her artistic pursuits and led the life of a liberated and prosperous artist.</p>
<p>“You’ve made a wise decision. It’s foolish to have eyes only for one man in this day and age,” Lichang, the social influencer who constantly featured in gossip magazines, raised her glass and grinned with her beautifully painted, tear-shaped eyes.</p>
<p>Having fought for succession against her older brother and achieved victory by driving him out of the country two years ago, she successfully took over the family’s fortune. In addition, she abandoned the façade she had put on to please her father and fully displayed her prowess in dealing with men, solidifying her reputation as a woman who didn’t hinder men from coming or going.</p>
<p>“Enough of that! Do you know how many attractive men there are? You should try dating them one by one!”</p>
<p>Nicky, the talented perfumer, and Jasmine’s childhood friend, exclaimed as she raised her wine glass. Jasmine’s expression turned peculiar.</p>
<p>“How dare you act like that when you said you’d dedicate your pure love <em>only </em>to my big brother one day?”</p>
<p>“I’m generous with my affection, so I left some for him. It’s fine,” Nicky boldly retorted. As Jasmine suppressed a chuckle, Lichang brushed her thick, wavy hair gently and mumbled under her breath.</p>
<p>“It seems like rumors have spread about you cozying up to the Duke already. Do you know that various men are eyeing you?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not that bad.”</p>
<p>While Jasmine chuckled quietly. The exceptional Aisha, narrowed her eyes and continued to subtly observe the men who were discreetly glancing in their direction.</p>
<p>Surrounded by her charming and dependable friends, Jasmine sat comfortably, surveying the social scene around her. When her eyes met those of various men, most of them blushed or offered a shy smile. Feeling rather pleased, Jasmine let out a soft chuckle.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m not being ignored by anyone. It’s quite nice!”</p>
<p>“What about that guy?”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“That guy. He’s been glancing at you for a while now.”</p>
<p>A handsome man with gray hair and light blue eyes flashed a playful smile. Although Jasmine was slightly taken aback by his captivating presence, she lightly tapped her wine glass with her index finger.</p>
<p><em>Well, I tend to like refined men. Ultimately, my preferences aren’t leading me in any particular direction.</em></p>
