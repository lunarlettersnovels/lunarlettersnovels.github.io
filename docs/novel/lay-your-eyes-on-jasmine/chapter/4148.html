            <p><strong>Chapter 106.2</strong></p>
<p>Even his refusal to acknowledge love was probably because the object or form of love he had defined differed from his current situation, or because he couldn’t accept being swayed by love himself, or something like that. It was obvious.</p>
<p>His tendencies were evident even during their carriage ride here.</p>
<p>Looking at Richard’s utterly calm face, Jasmine felt defiant. It hadn’t even been a day since this man had boldly promised to accommodate all her wishes.</p>
<p>Being nice? Not trying to control? Easy to say. But is he even capable of that? Irritated by what she sensed beneath his confident facade, she provoked him directly.</p>
<p>“You think that no matter what I do, I’ll end up marrying you anyway, right?”</p>
<p>When she asked with raised eyes, Richard’s eye twitched. He let out a quiet sigh.</p>
<p>“How dare I have such an arrogant thought…”</p>
<p>“Or you’re probably scheming in your head to make it happen. That’s what you want.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not true.”</p>
<p>Richard responded firmly, but both he and his counterpart realized it was a lie the moment it left his lips. Jasmine moistened her dry lips while meeting his blue eyes that could lie without changing expression. Why was she remembering that moment from six months ago now?</p>
<p>“What does it matter what my feelings are? In the entire empire, I would be the best man to suit you and satisfy you. I guarantee there’s no man better than me.”</p>
<p>“You say you love me.”</p>
<p>“If you love me, choose me first. Think wisely. Consider what’s more beneficial.”</p>
<p>Sometimes during their arguments, a devilish desire to win would coil up inside her, ready to strike. Though she didn’t know why it always turned out this way, this man had a talent for drawing out fiery emotions she didn’t even know existed within herself.</p>
<p>Jasmine smiled seductively. As Richard flinched and curled his index finger at her smile, beautiful like a blooming rose, another bombshell dropped.</p>
<p>“Fine. Let’s say I marry you.”</p>
<p>“What? Really?”</p>
<p>“Jasmine!”</p>
<p>Ignoring her family’s surprise, Jasmine smiled brightly at the frozen Richard. His eyes trembled with inevitable emotion, but there was also anxiety lurking in one corner.</p>
<p>Jasmine looked straight into those eyes while calling out to the restless Grand Duke.</p>
<p>“Dad, does our family need an immediate marriage?”</p>
<p>“What? Of course not! If you’re feeling pressured, don’t worry about it at all, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>Jasmine spoke while smiling cheerfully like a carefree girl.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll date as my heart desires, meet all sorts of different people, and then get married.”</p>
<p>Amidst the shock, only the bright Jasmine asked casually. That’s okay, right? Richard, now the focus of all the Grand Duke’s family’s attention, appeared no different from usual at first glance. That is, on the surface.</p>
<p>His upturned lips were as elegant as a well-crafted statue. When he started laughing “hahaha” while covering his eyes, Caras shot him a suspicious look, wondering if Richard had lost his mind from shock.</p>
<p>After a brief laugh that stopped abruptly, Richard responded politely and kindly.</p>
<p>“Do as you wish. I will wait. For as long as it takes.”</p>
<p>However, Jasmine felt a chill in her heart as she met his bloodshot blue eyes staring at her. As she realized he was genuinely angry, a thrill of excitement welled up in a corner of her heart.</p>
<p>Ah. A sigh escaped her. My once pure affection is no longer just affection. Perhaps the current Jasmine doesn’t love him as he is, but rather feels a love-hate relationship.</p>
<p>“As long as you choose me in the end, I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“You’re quite confident. Or is it broad-mindedness? I see you’re generous about your future wife’s past.”</p>
<p>“No. This is begging.”</p>
<p>If only you would choose me this way… I would endure even that dog-like situation.</p>
<p>“What wouldn’t I endure if you would become my wife?”</p>
<p>However, regardless of the sincerity in those words, Richard wondered if he could really tolerate seeing Jasmine holding someone else’s hand, introducing them as her lover.</p>
<p>Of course, the answer to that was obvious.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“So are we officially lovers now?”</p>
<p>That was what Richard asked immediately upon arriving the next day, as if by appointment.</p>
<p>After he left, Jasmine was grilled by her family, then tossed and turned all night, and now, half-dreaming, she had barely washed her face before being dragged out. While yawning softly, she tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you felt the same way, that you wanted to get to know me better?”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I want to get to know this person better.”</p>
<p>That’s what she had said. Having regained her senses after a night’s sleep, Jasmine adjusted her shawl, crossed her arms, and sighed. Hah, I really need to stop being so emotionally impulsive.</p>
<p>But this man was the same. She had clearly expressed her skeptical feelings and suggested starting slowly, but what’s this about being lovers? He came rushing the very next day, ready to seal the deal.</p>
<p>Jasmine responded indifferently while blowing on her hot tea.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you don’t care what I do before marriage as long as I marry you? Why do we need to date already?”</p>
<p>“Then do you have thoughts of marrying me?”</p>
<p>“Well… If I were to marry, you would be the best option in the entire empire.”</p>
<p>Though she said it casually, Richard fell silent at her response for some reason. Wondering what was wrong, she looked up to find him staring at her with an unreadable expression.</p>
<p>“What? Do you have something to say?”</p>
<p>“No. Just thinking how awful those words sound, even though I was the one who said them.”</p>
