            <p><strong>Chapter 11.2</strong></p>
<p>“That’s Charles, the second son of the Marquess. He’s got good looks, a strong physique, and a decent reputation. Plus, he inherited some property from his maternal family, so he’s a suitable option. Of course, you’re much too good for him, but he’s a cute choice.”</p>
<p>“That’s Charles, the second son of the Marquess. He’s handsome, has a good physique, and a decent reputation. Besides, he inherited some property from his maternal family, so he’s a suitable choice. Of course, you’re far too good for him, but he’s a cute option.”</p>
<p><em>He might not captivate your full attention, but for a casual practice meet-up, why not?</em></p>
<p>Lichang unfurled her fan, grinning behind it, revealing her sensual figure, tall stature, and confident demeanor. Always feeling like an older sister, Lichang had a special fondness for Jasmine and often called her by the nickname “Jeje.”</p>
<p>When Jasmine gave her an okay sign, the rest of their friends joined in the assessment. Overall, not too shabby, right?Jasmine tugged at her chin and lightly nibbled on her pinky finger, lost in thought. She felt the man’s blue eyes drawn to that spot.</p>
<p>Love… could it possibly be the solution to erasing old memories?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>With her friends’ informal endorsement, Charles had become a potential partner for Jasmine. As the second son of a viscount, he possessed a suitable upper-middle-class fortune and appearance, treating Jasmine with great affection and loyalty.</p>
<p>While Jasmine did harbor some favorable feelings toward him, she couldn’t exactly call it love just yet. Nevertheless, his courteous and occasionally endearingly bashful demeanor left her feel a bit perplexed. In other words, it was alright at all.</p>
<p>Since she had usually been chasing after one man’s coattails, receiving the attention of a man who seemed genuinely interested felt different.</p>
<p>As they continued to converse and share gestures, Jasmine realized once more that she had been overly fixated on a single aspect of her life, much like a frog in a well.</p>
<p>Having a romantic date with Charles to restore her trampled self-esteem was quite helpful.The change of pace was much needed.</p>
<p>Receiving a bouquet of beautiful flowers, strolling along picturesque paths, dining at an exquisite restaurant, and engaging in meaningful conversations – it was a wholly different experience. It was like savoring a dessert from a foreign land instead of the usual fare.</p>
<p>Lost in thought, Jasmine gazed at a sparkling fountain when a voice called her name.</p>
<p>“Lady Liovanni.”</p>
<p>“Well… would you consider taking a stroll with me to my estate’s lakeside next time?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Oh, right, he did mention something about inheriting an estate from his childhood.</p>
<p>Because of the generous well-being of Charles’s extended family and being his stepmother’s only child, he was secure in his future even as the second son.</p>
<p>Jasmine belatedly recalled the passing mention and scratched her cheek. “Isn’t it a bit far?” she said.</p>
<p>“Not at all. It’s just a little outside the capital’s outskirts, and would only take half a day. Don’t worry. I wouldn’t trouble you.”</p>
<p>Urgently waving his hand, he wore an eager expression that expressed his pure intentions of letting Jasmine see the beauty of his estate. His subtle words and actions introducing himself didn’t come off as overwhelming, and that’s why Jasmine found him kind of cute.</p>
<p>Was it because his intentions were so clear?</p>
<p>After constantly dealing with difficult men, being around a genuinely kind and comfortable man felt relieving. She probably understood why her friends had recommended him. Maybe they just wanted her to experience love without complications.</p>
<p>A soft sigh escaped her. Yeah, he wasn’t bad. He was decent. He genuinely cared, showed consideration, and never crossed boundaries. She felt at ease, and there was no excessive physical contact.</p>
<p>But that was about it. Nothing beyond liking developed. Could she even say that she wasn’t curious about what came next? For now, spending time with him and having conversations felt manageable and like a significant investment of energy or time.</p>
<p>However, going further than this seemed burdensome, in truth.</p>
<p>Was this just because it was the first time? Would things get better with time? Would they grow closer?</p>
<p>Jasmine pondered these thoughts, thinking she might be overly critical of herself. Honestly, shouldn’t a first date make her excited in and of itself? But here she was, already having these kinds of thoughts. She even felt apologetic towards Charles. While she maintained a genuinely lighthearted attitude, she wondered if it was disrespectful to him, considering his sincerity.</p>
<p>When Jasmine shared these concerns, Lichang, an expert in love, burst into laughter. Jasmine’s innocent and straightforward gaze made her feel strangely uneasy.</p>

<p>When Jasmine shared these concerns, Lichang, an expert in love, burst into laughter. Jasmine’s innocent and straightforward gaze made her feel strangely uneasy.</p>
<p>“Such a rookie. Why worry about that? The other person will handle it themselves. Are you having secret conversations about getting serious, falling deeply in love? Or maybe even kissing?”</p>
<p>“Are you crazy? No!”</p>
<p>It had only been a short while since they started dating! Jasmine jumped up and defended herself, but Lichang just grinned, wondering why she was acting so flustered.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s possible. There are even those passionate couples who head straight to the bedroom as soon as their eyes meet.”</p>
<p>“…That’s a bit… Well, yes, that could happen, but it’s not my style.”</p>
<p>Slowly, while they liked each other, she wanted to get to know him better. Discover the newness of peaceful scenery while walking together, exchange smiles and gaze into each other’s eyes, learn about various things together, maybe even share hobbies or something like that.</p>
<p>Certainly, up until now, Jasmine, who had been perpetually single, had fantasies about romance and her own innocent ideals about dating. With a sly expression, Lichang looked at her as if finding her adorable beyond words.</p>
<p>“Just relax and meet him. You thinking about it that way is already putting unnecessary pressure on yourself, isn’t it? You become serious when you think about it. So, you must have liked the Duke for quite a while.”</p>
<p>With playfulness and affection, Lichang’s hand gently stroked Jasmine’s cheek, making her feel bashful.</p>
<p><em>Is that so? Am I being serious for no reason?</em></p>
