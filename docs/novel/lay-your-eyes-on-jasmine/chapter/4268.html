            <h3><strong>Chapter 46.1</strong></h3>
<p>“I don’t know what more I should do.”</p>
<p>If she didn’t want to be publicly courted or proposed, he could do nothing. What she wanted was very trivial, yet he couldn’t say anything without coming to a conclusion or being sure about it.</p>
<p>Wasn’t that deception? He didn’t want to lie to her. He couldn’t understand why they had to be fixated on such matters and its importance.</p>
<p>What more should we consider beyond wanting each other? He felt suffocated.</p>
<p>“You want me, too. Didn’t you want the same thing as I did? What’s the problem? Is it so bad that I want to have you and be responsible for you? I understand the disappointment,” Richard said.</p>
<p>“I know it’s frustrating because our starting points are different. But the outcome will be the same. That’s how it will be. Isn’t that what matters? Why make things difficult? Do you really think such superficial words can define our relationship?”</p>
<p>Looking at him in disbelief, Jasmine asked with frustration in her voice. “Do you even know what you’re saying right now?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Obviously, it sounds like crazy nonsense. I have never been sane in front of you for the past week. Do you think I’m in my right mind?”</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>He retorted with sarcasm, looking like he had clearly lost his temper. Jasmine was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“But you’re the one who made me like this.”</p>
<p>It was a suppressed remark that spilled out of him.</p>
<p>“You touched me first.”</p>
<p>He completely crumbled, his face becoming raw and bare. His eyes glowed with intensity.”</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me like you hate me now? Don’t you have any sense of responsibility?”</p>
<p>“Is this all my fault?”</p>
<p>Jasmine finally turned to him.</p>
<p>“Yes, you said it well! That da!mned responsibility! You jsut feel sorry and burdened! Even though I said I didn’t like it, you kept following me at the party because of that da!mned sense of duty and morality! You admitted it earlier, didn’t you? If we hadn’t slept together, this wouldn’t have happened!”</p>
<p>“That’s…!”</p>
<p>“You, who repeatedly asked multiple women to marry you within a week without even loving them, it must be because of your sense of responsibility and my family. You have nothing to lose! No matter how I think about it, it doesn’t make sense if it’s not that. Right? Can you say it’s not true at all?”</p>
<p>“A person like you would ask to marry a woman he doesn’t love after sleeping with her a few times in just a week because of your sense of responsibility and my family standing. You have nothing to lose! No matter how much I think about it, there’s no other explanation. Right? Can you deny that?”</p>
<p>“Fu!ck, no! It’s not true!”</p>
<p>“Then what is it? Don’t spew out sweet words like you like me again!”</p>
<p>“What should I say?! You don’t believe me!”</p>
<p>She growled sharply at him and turned around. Richard messed his hair as if he was going crazy. After arguing with the other in turns, both huffed and glared at the other person.</p>
<p>As if trying to calm down, Richard glared at his feet. After some moment, he darkly muttered.</p>
<p>“Do you think you’re the same as that deer? So what if you both are?”</p>
<p>Her pale blue eyes bore into her.</p>
<p>“Does that satisfy you? Do you want me to fake my feelings?”</p>
<p>He looked at Jasmine’s small face. Now it’s your turn to answer.</p>
<p>“If that’s what you really want…”</p>
<p>Fu!ck. He felt like an assh0le. The blood rushed to his temples when he muttered his assumptions. He’d lost track of why he was so angry and where this fight had started.</p>
<p>He was a mess of anger, sorrow, and betrayal. He didn’t understand such feelings. He just wanted to get this over quickly.</p>
<p>He felt like my head would explode from the rush of emotions. It was more urgent and intense than when he fought a battle in a very unfavorable situation. But with Jasmine, the fight was as good as a loss.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to hurt her, but he couldn’t raise the white flag for her. It was indeed a foolish fight. But there was nothing in any manual that taught him how to handle this situation.</p>
<p>So, he became cold, the way he usually solved problems. Wearing the mask of an iron-blooded duke: cold, pragmatic, and fearless to use force when necessary.</p>
<p>“I can’t force you. I’ll follow your wishes.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“But I will propose.”</p>
<p>Jasmine wondered what he meant. If he thought her feelings were fake, so be it, but to still propose?</p>
<p>As Jasmine frowned, Richard approached her and grabbed her slender wrist with a grip that, though not painful, conveyed a cold strength. Jasmine made a face. His chilly voice echoed like a declaration of war.</p>
<p>I told you. The outcome won’t change.</p>
