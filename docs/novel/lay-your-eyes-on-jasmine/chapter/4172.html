            <h3>Chapter 94.1</h3>
<p>“I know you don’t like anything too sweet, so how about this cake that’s tangy and sweetened only with fruit? It’s made with the finest flour from the Iren region, making it richer and the cream lighter yet fragrant, so you’ll like it. You like nuts, don’t you? Try this walnut pie. As for drinks, something that pairs well with the menu… Jasmine?”</p>
<p>When there was no response for a while, Richard looked up curiously. When their eyes met directly, Jasmine felt the back of her neck heat up. She had been staring too openly. Trying to act nonchalant, she quickly averted her gaze and nodded. She could feel him still watching her.</p>
<p>“Oh. Um, sure. But you seem to know a lot. Anyone would think you’re the owner here.”</p>
<p>“And if I were the owner?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“If I were the owner, would you like that?”</p>
<p>Richard, resting his chin on his hand, asked again with a tilted gaze. Jasmine tilted her head and answered.</p>
<p>“Well, if you were the owner, would you give me free service?”</p>
<p>Richard let out a short laugh. He rubbed his chin and chuckled before replying.</p>
<p>“Maybe?”</p>
<p>Jasmine firmly extended her hand.</p>
<p>“Then give me the free service.”</p>
<p>“Pfft!”</p>
<p>He burst into laughter, clutching his stomach like a mischievous boy. Jasmine, now accustomed to Richard’s behavior, took it in stride, but the surrounding onlookers were shocked by the intensely personal side of the Iron Duke.</p>
<p>Even the old Jasmine would have been surprised. Seeing him like this, it was clear that despite his reputation as the Iron Duke, Richard was just another person.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a thought crossed her mind. Had she ever consumed him based on her own perceptions?</p>
<p>While she knew it was nearly impossible to completely avoid projecting and exchanging expectations in relationships, she wondered if even the smallest expectations might have been a burden to someone like him, who always carried the weight of everyone’s expectations and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Who does someone everyone relies on, lean on? Or, is there even someone they can lean on?</p>
<p>Even if not relying entirely, is there someone who could share even a slight burden with him, think together, and accept him as he is, allowing him to rest? Jasmine didn’t know.</p>
<p>There were friends like Princess Nysa and numerous devoted retainers who served him loyally, but would they truly have no expectations of Richard?</p>
<p>Even the slightest bit. Such a sensitive and responsible man would surely feel and react to even the smallest things.</p>
<p>She sincerely hoped there was someone like that.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, Jasmine found herself genuinely thinking this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Richard, who had placed their order, smiled more relaxedly and lazily.</p>
<p>“I’ve wanted to come here with you since this place opened.”</p>
<p>“Why, because you wanted to give me free service?”</p>
<p>“That too.”</p>
<p>He chuckled playfully and gave her a teasing smile.</p>
<p>“When I think about being with you, I always remember you eating sweet things. You’d fill your cheeks and chew away. So, whenever someone enjoys something sweet or when desserts come out after a meal, I can’t help but think of you.”</p>
<p>Jasmine looked at him, lost in memories, without replying. Since their previous conversation, he had avoided saying anything that might make her feel emotionally burdened.</p>
<p>But today, perhaps because they were here to enjoy something sweet together or because they had achieved their goal, he was relaxed and talking about their old days with that look on his face. She couldn’t find a suitable response and instead took a sip of water. It wasn’t uncomfortable to listen to; she was just thirsty.</p>
<p>“Then I started thinking it would have been nice if I had given you even tastier treats. You would have enjoyed them so much. I still feel regretful about it.”</p>
<p>As if feeding a stray cat, Jasmine thought with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Just then, as if on cue, the desserts they had ordered began to arrive one after another. The colorful cakes and pies were presented in beautifully artistic porcelain dishes.</p>
<p>They were so pretty that it felt almost a shame to touch them. Jasmine, marveling at the sight, picked up her fork first. Glancing at him, he gestured for her to go ahead. She soon dug into the cake with delight.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>By the name of Liovanni, she swore that the cakes she had eaten before were not real cakes. They were mere imitations. This was the real deal. The subtle and refreshing sweetness, unlike the sugar and butter-laden cakes, filled her mouth and lifted her spirits.</p>
<p>Humming a tune, she quickly devoured the cake Richard had recommended, and soon, the other cakes he suggested were lined up on the table.</p>
