            <p><strong>Chapter 79.1</strong></p>
<p>Once was not enough. They lay side by side, still connected, sharing the aftermath of bliss before intertwining again. Whether anyone saw them or not didn’t matter—they leaned against a tree, fu@cked against each other, and screamed like animals.</p>
<p>They stood, and Jasmine, unable to bear the intensity, collapsed, her legs trembling, and he continued to thrust savagely, holding her limp body. In the middle of the garden, she knelt and sucked his co.ck, her face and body covered in his s#men.</p>
<p>Jasmine swallowed hard. Richard saw her small tongue and furrowed his brow in agony.</p>
<p>“Ha. D@mn….”</p>
<p>He groaned, rubbing his forehead against her shoulder. It was a desperate, pleading gesture.</p>
<p>“When you’re in front of me….”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I become the lowest, most despicable man in the world.”</p>
<p>It’s so difficult.</p>
<p>His gloomy voice pierced her ears. Her heart pounded, a strange tingling making her head spin.</p>
<p>Seeing him so excited and unsure of himself sent a thrill through her chest. Jasmine blushed deeply and gritted her teeth. She would have been all over him in a heartbeat. In her mind, they had already entwined multiple times in that brief moment.</p>
<p>For a while, they were silent.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Richard whispered, giving her a brief kiss on the cheek before pulling away. Jasmine, blinking slowly, heard his sigh and watched him lower his coat and sit at a distance, rubbing his face.</p>
<p>Seeing his expression, she felt uneasy and disheartened. He looked as though she had inflicted some cruel torture on him.</p>
<p>Jasmine also felt confused and powerless against this intense attraction, but to be honest, her heart wasn’t racing to the point of bursting like it once did. She no longer felt like she would die if she didn’t see him or act foolishly out of control.</p>
<p>That passionate summer had already passed. Because of that, she didn’t know how to deal with him, behaving like his former self. Everything was uncertain, and Jasmine didn’t know the current Richard.</p>
<p>More precisely, she was afraid of getting to know him.</p>
<p>After a moment of difficult contemplation, she spoke.</p>
<p>“Uh….”</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>Richard cut her off, covering his eyes with his hand.</p>
<p>“Be quiet for a moment.”</p>
<p>The sound of his voice seemed to stir her up even more.</p>
<p>Confused, Jasmine glanced at his pants and was startled, quickly averting her gaze.</p>
<p>Even while looking at the neatly trimmed, low garden shrubs, the redness of her flushed ears refused to fade. Richard only moved his eyes, gazing at those enticing ears. D@mn, there was no sign of relief below. He shut his eyes tightly, sighing.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Wh-what? Is it gone?”</p>
<p>Richard chuckled at her rambling as she looked everywhere but at him. Despite how many times they had been together, she still had things to be embarrassed about.</p>
<p>“Say something. Anything.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Anything. Just say something.”</p>
<p>Her chirping, chatty voice always had a way of making people feel pleasantly comfortable.</p>
<p>When they shared intimacy and whispered softly to each other, her clear tone could lull him to sleep as she patted his bare back.</p>
<p>Those were times he cherished—no, in hindsight, those were times he loved. He watched her with softened blue eyes, noting that she still couldn’t meet his gaze.</p>
<p>“Sir Soyer and Marian, I think it might all be a misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>“Ah, your friend.”</p>
<p>Richard, who had almost forgotten why they were here, murmured after a brief delay. He glanced up at the window above their heads and asked,</p>
<p>“So, how did you come up with this idea?”</p>
<p>“What idea?”</p>
<p>“Spying below the office window to gather information.”</p>
<p>He almost said “eavesdropping” but changed his wording, recalling the incident that had nearly driven them apart.</p>
<p>Contrary to Richard’s concern, Jasmine was thinking about a different past. That day she visited his office before they were deeply involved. Now that she’d calmed down, she realized she’d been just as passionate.</p>
<p>“I guess, because of past experiences?”</p>
<p>Richard hesitated, but Jasmine didn’t notice and continued.</p>
<p>“I know the military office is old, but they should really consider soundproofing. What if an actual spy got in?”</p>
<p>“No one without proper credentials can enter. This was an exceptional case, and military secrets are well protected. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Not so sure about that.”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s muttering puzzled Richard, but she didn’t elaborate. Seeing her clammed up, he changed the topic.</p>
<p>“So, what’s your plan now?”</p>
<p>“Well, since I’m here, I might as well meet them and go.”</p>
<p>She had intended to but got sidetracked. Jasmine pondered the conversations she had overheard earlier.</p>
<p>“Seems like my brother-in-law hasn’t been well lately. Maybe he’s too stressed to sleep.”</p>
<p>“If he’s emotionally troubled, that’s possible.”</p>
<p>Jasmine glanced at Richard, who seemed overly empathetic as if it were his own issue and continued.</p>
<p>“I thought if there were anything going on, it would be obvious. But his colleagues don’t seem to know anything. He goes back and forth between work and home every day, so if he’s cheating, it must be at work.”</p>
<p>“It might not be at work.”</p>
<p>Richard shrugged at her gaze. Honestly, he wasn’t interested in this matter but used it as a pretext to keep talking with her.</p>
