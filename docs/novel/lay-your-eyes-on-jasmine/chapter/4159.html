            <h3>Chapter 101.1</h3>
<p>Richard’s dark hair and marble-like nose came into view, and soon, his cool scent brushed past her nose. A light touch grazed her cheek and then withdrew. As Richard looked up at Jasmine’s dazed face, he smiled softly. His clean, elegant eyes curved like a winter fox and sparkled blue.</p>
<p>“I’ll accept this instead of an apology.”</p>
<p>He silently laughed while looking down at Jasmine, who was still stunned, her cheek tingling from his touch.</p>
<p>He had seemed angry, but seeing him brighten up so quickly left her feeling both incredulous and relieved. Yet, it also felt like she was being swayed, which was unsettling. Jasmine glared at him before getting into the carriage.</p>
<p>“The friend you had an appointment with, is she Sir Soyer’s wife?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She went home today.”</p>
<p>“So, they must have reconciled.”</p>
<p>Leaning against the swaying carriage, Richard spoke, and Jasmine observed him. She had thought he wasn’t interested since he hadn’t responded, but now he was asking about it, showing that he did care.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, I just remembered. I sent a letter about that issue. Did you receive it?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Why else would I have worked late?”</p>
<p>“Sorry? Because of Sir Soyer’s issue?”</p>
<p>Richard gave a dry laugh as he looked at the surprised Jasmine.</p>
<p>“Did I seem that close to him? I meant I was excited to hear from you and wanted to come as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Jasmine was momentarily stunned, then turned her flushed face away from his penetrating gaze. She recalled feeling disappointed while waiting for his message. She quickly changed the subject, and his blue eyes watched her with a subtle amusement.</p>
<p>“Anyway, it’s a relief that they reconciled. Marian has been through a lot, even if it doesn’t seem like it, so I hoped it wasn’t anything serious.”</p>
<p>“You must have been quite concerned.”</p>
<p>To be honest, Richard didn’t care whether they divorced or not. It wasn’t his business.</p>
<p>But he didn’t want Jasmine, who was so caring and devoted to her people, to be worried and hurt over their issues. So, Richard had looked into Soyer’s situation and, for once, genuinely inquired about someone else’s well-being.</p>
<p>It didn’t feel strange. Now, Jasmine’s concerns were his concerns, and her family and loved ones’ peace was part of her concerns.</p>
<p>Sensing this change unconsciously, Jasmine found herself sharing more trivial details than before.</p>
<p>“Well, she’s not completely over it yet… but Sir Soyer said what Marian needed to hear.</p>
<p>“What did he say?”</p>
<p>“Sorry. It was all my fault. I love you.”</p>
<p>Richard looked puzzled, not quite understanding. Jasmine clicked her tongue.</p>
<p>“Being a woman is all about the simple things, the little things. Why don’t men get that?”</p>
<p>“Is that really important?”</p>
<p>“It’s very important. Women want a formal apology, an acknowledgment that the problem was their partner’s fault, and finally, to hear that they are still loved. That’s why they cry, fight, and go through all sorts of things. From a distance, it might seem trivial, but it’s crucial.”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s lips curled into a bitter smile as she murmured her lament. Richard wanted to ask if she had felt the same way, but he couldn’t bring himself to voice it. He didn’t want to make her recall the difficult times from their past conflicts. So, he changed the subject.</p>
<p>“It’s fortunate that Count Soyer avoided punishment. In his case, it might not have been a dismissal, but he could have faced a dishonorable discharge.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s a relief. And despite everything, I think Marian would have returned to her husband. She loves him that much.”</p>
<p>“She has deep affection for her husband.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but more than that, she has a strong attachment and sense of responsibility towards her husband and family. To her, her husband and family are inseparable, like one entity.”</p>
<p>When Jasmine was younger, she found Marian’s dedication impressive and felt as if Marian belonged to a different world. The thought of being like her was overwhelming. However, now, with more time passed, she found herself a bit envious.</p>
<p>What must it feel like to have a world so firmly built, one that is entirely your own? A world that is your everything, your nest, your absolute ally?</p>
<p>That’s probably why Marian was so devastated and hurt when she found out her husband had been unfaithful.</p>
<p>Jasmine unconsciously let out a long breath.</p>
<p>“Marriage really isn’t an ordinary thing. With just a casual resolve, it’s hard to stay committed for a lifetime…”</p>
<p>In the past, she had agreed to marriage proposals without much deep thought, relying on a vague image of what marriage entailed. But this recent experience had changed her perspective.</p>
<p>The more she thought about it, the more she realized that ‘just getting married and living together’ wasn’t simple at all. Marriage was a reality. The relationship between spouses, childbirth, raising children, and building a family—all of it fundamentally changed life from what it was before.</p>
<p>The idea that I can’t be just ‘myself’ anymore, what trust between spouses truly means, and having to consider children and family in every important decision—it’s really no small matter. Jasmine furrowed her brow.</p>
<p>What if she had accepted Richard’s proposal and they had gotten married? If they had maintained an engagement for at least half a year and then married, they would be newlyweds by now.</p>
