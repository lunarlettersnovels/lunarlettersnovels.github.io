            <p><strong>Chapter 19.1</strong></p>
<p>After gently laying her on the bed, Richard sat on the edge, loosening his stifling tie. Exhaling a sigh, he couldn’t help but feel uneasy about Jasmine’s excessive drinking.</p>
<p>It would surely lead to a nasty hangover the next day. He pulled on the tie to get some relief and ordered warm water, honey tea, towels, and other necessities needed for her to sober up. For a moment, he gazed down at her pale face.</p>
<p>Just a while ago, she had been laughing and celebrating her card game victory.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, he reached out, brushing aside the disheveled strands of her golden hair. Her finely-arched eyebrows trembled slightly. She had such a lovely face, like a perfectly crafted pearl. He ran his finger across her forehead, feeling a frown forming.</p>
<p>She looked even more beautiful when she smiled.</p>
<p>At that moment, a knock at the door interrupted. It was a maid bringing a hot towel and some water, among other things. As he accepted them and turned around, Richard was taken aback.</p>
<p>Jasmine, who had appeared lifeless moments ago, was now sitting up quite properly, and she seemed rather composed. He placed the hot towel and other items on the table and quickly approached her.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, are you okay? It seems you’ve had a bit too much to drink.”</p>
<p>“Richard Aion.”</p>
<p>Jasmine raised her head and stared at him intensely with her violet eyes. A sudden premonition sent shivers down their spines. As if an invisible thread had connected them, they were captivated by a powerful sensation.</p>
<p>Their faces were close, gazes locked, and even their heartbeats synchronized.</p>
<p>It was the first time Richard had seen her face. Despite its pallor, it held a captivating allure. He felt an electrifying presence and an urgent need to leave this room immediately.</p>
<p>However, before he could turn away, she made her move.</p>
<p>“I like you.”</p>
<p>In a room so quiet that it felt eerie, her confession rang out. Richard stood frozen, as if turned to ice. At that moment, nothing, absolutely nothing, made sense in his otherwise sharp mind. It was as if a blank canvas had been placed before him.</p>
<p>Taken aback and bewildered, he looked back at her. Jasmine repeated herself.</p>
<p>“I like you, you know? You’re aware of that, right?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“But, I know you don’t feel the same way. So, what I wanted to say…”</p>
<p>Her petite hand reached out, gripping the edge of the bed, and she leaned closer. Richard found himself unable to stop her advancing toward him.</p>
<p>As if entranced, he could only watch as her petite face drew nearer. Eventually, when her slender fingers brushed against his thigh, his gaze involuntarily dropped for a moment, only to be captivated by her face once more as if drawn in by a sweet scent.</p>
<p>Jasmine, her lips barely grazing his ear, whispered softly.</p>
<p>“Do you want me?”</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, he could completely forget.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Looking back, their first encounter was nothing more than a casual brush among nobles.</p>
<p>Richard was a military academy student, and as always, he dutifully followed his father’s summons and noble obligations. However, he was truly bored.</p>
<p>Parties were essentially the same everywhere. Exchange pleasantries, engage in mundane conversations, dance, and repeat.</p>
<p>He had been confined to the academy grounds as a cadet, with outings allowed only during vacations or on rare special occasions like this. The rare opportunity to breathe the outside air felt even more stifling due to his father’s watchful eye.</p>
<p>The esteemed Duke Aion, Richard’s father, always treated him like a ticking time bomb, constantly wary of his deviations and potential missteps.</p>
<p>If he happened to get into a fight with fellow students, clash with professors over differing opinions, or even receive some form of disciplinary action, a letter would arrive promptly. He knew that his stubbornness from childhood often led to mischief and disagreements.</p>
<p>However, Richard was no longer a child. But in his father’s eyes, he still seemed like a seven-year-old troublemaker.</p>
<p>He felt irritated, wanting to loosen the tie that constricted his neck. Riding on horseback or engaging in hunting seemed more efficient than this. He longed to smoke a cigar, but he couldn’t, and his throat felt dry. Why was it that he could meet women freely, yet drinking alcohol was forbidden?</p>
<p>Soon, he would officially receive the title of a knight in the Empire, but he couldn’t comprehend this law. On frustrating days like this, indulging in some alcohol or a tincture and drifting off to sleep seemed like a foolish but effective way to cope. However, he had to endure, for the scrutiny of his father was ever-present. He felt stifled.</p>
<p>He considered that becoming an adult as quickly as possible might be a better option. He squinted his eyes, trying to peer into the future. But just as he did, the waltz music that always played at the start of the debutante season began, and girls in white dresses began to enter the room gracefully.</p>
<p>Like white lilies, the girls were lovely and pure, but to Richard, on the brink of adulthood, they appeared to be nothing more than young girls, fresh and naive.</p>
<p>When he looked closely, they were only three years younger than he was.</p>
<p>He leaned against a wall, sighing, and slid his hand into his pocket. He waited for the waltz to finish, leaning against the dimly lit wall. He could guess why his father had brought him to this party.</p>
<p>Among the debutantes today, only two or so seemed to have a decent background as prospective brides for him.</p>
