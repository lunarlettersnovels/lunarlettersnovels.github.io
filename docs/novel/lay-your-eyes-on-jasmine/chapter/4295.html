            <p><strong>Chapter 32.2</strong></p>
<p>Richard’s expression suddenly changed into dissatisfaction. As soon as Jasmine seemed to back away from him, hesitate, or regret anything, he behaved like a wolf whose fur was bristling at its female being taken away. Jasmine felt even more embarrassed.</p>
<p>So, maybe that’s why this conversation was stalled for so long. However, this time, she looked at his sensitive, sharp eyes and spoke clearly.</p>
<p>“Of course, it’s not a problem or anything strange, like I said. The issue is…”</p>
<p>“Problem? Was there an issue between us?”</p>
<p>He asked as if he really couldn’t comprehend. His forehead was wrinkled in apparent bewilderment, and the uneasiness about their relationship, his concerns about her reactions, were etched on his brow.</p>
<p>Jasmine, who hadn’t read it all yet, was choking up at his reluctance. But she persevered by taking a deep breath. A conversation was needed.</p>
<p>“This is it.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“We don’t know each other well enough.”</p>
<p>“I know plenty about you.”</p>
<p>She chuckled at his quick response. What did he know? But her laughter faded as he continued.</p>
<p>“Because I’ve been thinking about you every day, every hour, for the past few days.”</p>
<p>She was momentarily at a loss for words. But there was no falsehood in the deep, dark flames that danced in his eyes. She lowered her gaze, mainly to protect her heart, then tried to cool down the rising heat coursing through her body.</p>
<p>She almost succumbed to the urge to pull him close and kiss him right then and there. Not today. Not today!</p>
<p>“Well, I guess that’s true. You’ve been sticking to me day and night.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Richard responded in a resigned tone mixed with annoyance. His face, looking like a boy who had lost his candy, was probably due to his stubbornness.</p>
<p>Jasmine saw a new side of him every day. And this man was less temperamental and patient than she thought.</p>
<p>“What I mean is…”</p>
<p>How many times has she said this?</p>
<p>“I like everything we do together. But you focus on <em>that</em> too much.”</p>
<p>That. Se.x. Both of them, unable to say the word out loud, heard it echoing in their ears. Jasmine’s neck turned crimson, but she didn’t avert her gaze.</p>
<p>Richard was dazed for a while, and a beat later, he finally understood. He opened his mouth and closed it. He covered his forehead with his hand, looked down in thought for a moment, and then raised his eyes to meet hers. His Adam’s apple bobbed.</p>
<p>“I see,” he muttered with a sigh. “I understand what you’re saying.”</p>
<p>“Do you…?”</p>
<p>Jasmine asked, a bit uncertain. Richard wrinkled his nose.</p>
<p>“Do you think of me as just a lu!stful beast? Of course… I also thought it was too much.”</p>
<p>So he had been thinking about it all this time. His body and mind were not in harmony. Why had he become so impatient? Why couldn’t he control herself when he saw her? He was like a male in heat.</p>
<p>In reality, Richard didn’t experience strong sexual urges beyond his basic physical needs, and it was more about finding a suitable outlet or companion than being overwhelmed by desire. He had never really known what it was like to be consumed by a relentless urge to take something urgently.</p>
<p>But why was it different with her?</p>
<p>Richard was filled with questions he didn’t have the answers yet. He occasionally thought she was cute, lovely, and beautiful, just like anyone else would. It had felt that way from the very first time he saw her.</p>
<p>Of course, Richard knew that this was a ridiculous and repulsive psychological and physiological delusion. That’s why he was confused. It was unlike any relationship he had known until now.</p>
<p>Compared to the emotions he had held within, the feelings he had for her were hot and impulsive, making it impossible to keep a clear head. It differed from the exhaustion and sense of duty he felt in a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>He was eager to savor her like a sweet honey pastry. To lick, suck, and swallow her so desperately that it wore him out.</p>
<p>In reality, his primal desires may have been even greater than his consideration for her and his sense of propriety as a gentleman. It was as if it resembled animalistic instincts.</p>
<p>When he was with Jasmine, Richard felt a surge of energy and liberation, like a wild beast freely racing through the heart of the jungle, having shed the confining clothes that had clung to him. In her presence, he became more honest and true to his inner voice, more “Richard.”</p>
<p>Was it because Jasmine had probed his true nature, stripped away his inhibitions, and humiliated him?</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure, but in front of her, he could behave as savagely as he pleased, and she loved it. It felt good. It brought them closer, and he was convinced that they were a perfect match.</p>
<p>So, she was in a completely different headspace as him. Was it because he was contemplating marriage? Because this was the first time he had seriously considered marriage in a relationship?</p>
<p>But why did he want to marry her in the first place?</p>
<p>There were times when he felt he should take responsibility since they had spent their first night together, but if that were the only reason, he wouldn’t be so willing or even eager. Their family situations and conditions were also favorable for them, but if that were all…</p>
<p>Just by looking at her, he wanted to touch her. His hands itch to do so.</p>
