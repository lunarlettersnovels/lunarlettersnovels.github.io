            <p><strong>Chapter 40.1</strong></p>
<p>“Previous empress… she’s Richard’s aunt, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. In private.”</p>
<p>Richard replied. Looking at his puzzled expression, Jasmine couldn’t help but think about it again and again. It was as if someone had played a gramophone that played an endless loop.</p>
<p><em>“Although I need the Grand Duchy Liovanni, it’s not urgent enough for me to risk your life. If you end up like His Majesty and your mother, how can you look at your late uncle?”</em></p>
<p>Come to think of it, the fiasco between the former empress and the emperor was infamous. Despite the many power struggles between noble families, divorces were not unheard of.  Jasmine didn’t know much about it because it happened when she was young.</p>
<p>For a moment, Jasmine pictured the Duke and Duchess smiling happily after following the ceremonial processes, from talks of marriage, proposal, engagement, and until the wedding ceremony with everyone’s eyes on them.</p>
<p>It was merely in her mind, but it soured her mood nevertheless. It felt sickening, like a weird, structured play. It felt like she had become a pretty puppet on a stage for everyone’s satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>I was so excited, not knowing that I was the only fool. Yes, I didn’t know anything. You’re discussing with someone else, not me.</em></p>
<p>Jasmine pressed her lips together. “The Crown Prince and Richard seem quite close.”</p>
<p>She had said the same thing before, but somehow, it sounded chilly. Richard raised an eyebrow and gently touched the back of her hand. It was a gentle gesture.</p>
<p>“He is first the future sun before he is my cousin,” he said.</p>
<p>He sneakily drew a line between their relationship. As if soothing Jasmine’s concerns. He was undoubtedly perceptive. Jasmine found it annoying.</p>
<p>It would have been better if he were as dull as her kind brother, Caras. Remaining oblivious and acting like his usual self would be more helpful in controlling these bubbling emotions.</p>
<p>Even though it wasn’t logical, Jasmine was currently in a state where she couldn’t be rational.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, are you not feeling well? You look pale, too. Are you in a bad mood? I’m worried that you caught a cold from the wind yesterday.”</p>
<p>A large hand affectionately touched her forehead. There was no fever. He gently rubbed her hand, which was colder than usual.</p>
<p>To Jasmine, his touch was warm and comforting, and it made her nervous. She looked at her small hand encased in his.</p>
<p>Her brain chastised her heart for letting her emotions get out of hand. Such marriages were expected in their society. But torn heart resisted.</p>
<p><em>How can I say this pain is nothing when it hurts?</em></p>
<p><em>Why do I have to endure this unfair agony? What did I do wrong? Do you have self-respect? Are you so infatuated that you can’t even feel embarrassed?</em></p>
<p>Jasmine endured Richard’s touch for a while and then withdrew her hand. His hand awkwardly hung in mid-air, not expecting her action.</p>
<p>“I should call the maid, Marie.”</p>
<p>The flowers are wilting.</p>
<p>As she stood up and turned her body away, Richard, silently watching her pull the string, narrowed his eyes. She managed a quick smile, as ceremonious as it could be, and said,</p>
<p>“Oh, right,” she began. “Thank you for the flowers.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome.”</p>
<p>Richard smoothly responded while still examining her carefully. They briefly locked eyes. Eventually, Jasmine was the one to avert her gaze first.</p>
<p>“I’m a bit tired.”</p>
<p>“Are you really feeling unwell?”</p>
<p>Even though his question was filled with concern, the tone felt a bit off. It seemed as if he were interrogating her.</p>
<p>Jasmine briefly glanced at his face. Worry, weariness, and mild anxiety.  She pulled the blanket over herself without responding. Even though he was ignored, Richard quickly propped her up comfortably with a serious look on his face, truly convinced that she was unwell.</p>
<p>He tidied her hair, and his touch carefully roamed over her closed eyelids. She let out a tired sigh as if exhaling her fatigue.</p>
<p>A moment of silence ensued.</p>
<p>One wanted to persistently throw questions in the heavy silence, while the other stubbornly ignored the silence between them.</p>
<p>And of course, there was never a time when she didn’t look back with sparkling eyes when he glanced at her, greeted her, or even touched her.</p>
<p>But this time, Jasmine remained silent, covering her eyes with the back of her hand without moving the slightest bit. This continued until her maid came into her room with a knock.</p>
<p>“I’d like a hot drink, please. Also…”</p>
<p>Only after Richard turned his gaze away from Jasmine for the first time, glancing at the meal left on the table, he discovered nothing had been touched. Richard’s expression stiffened as he quickly turned to the pale Jasmine. It was already well into noon.</p>
<p>“Bring a soothing soup for the throat, and call a doctor immediately.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>Cutting off the order briskly, Jasmine opened her eyes. She waved her hand as if exhausted.</p>
<p>“I’ll feel better after I get some rest.”</p>
<p>“But, Jasmine, you need to get an accurate diagnosis.”</p>
<p>Richard spoke persuasively as if he were handling a delicate child.</p>
<p>Jasmine made a face. What doctor? Even if they mentioned some illness, it was probably just a mild flu. She was just a little upset; her pride was hurt and a tiny bit wounded. That was all. Nothing special. Really.</p>
