            <h3>Chapter 76.1</h3>
<p>Richard replied in a businesslike yet ostensibly kind manner.</p>
<p>“May I ask what your business might be?”</p>
<p>Jasmine hesitated briefly. If it were her own private matter, she wouldn’t have minded, but it involved Marian. Richard’s eyes subtly dimmed as he gauged her hesitation.</p>
<p>“It seems you have someone else to meet.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, I need to see someone from the White Knights.”</p>
<p>Jasmine answered straightforwardly. Richard smiled, though his expression stiffened slightly.</p>
<p>“Is that so? I didn’t know you had acquaintances there.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not quite an acquaintance.”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s face grew ambiguous at the thought of Soyer, and as her uncertainty lingered, Richard’s blue eyes darkened. His gaze turned as gloomy and overcast as a winter sky. He spoke ahead of her, preempting any explanation.</p>
<p>“If it’s urgent, I can escort you.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need—”</p>
<p>“Whether you want it or not, I cannot let an outsider go alone.”</p>
<p>His words carried a subtle pressure. Jasmine sighed inwardly, feeling increasingly uncomfortable. Not only was it an intrusion into Marian’s private life and an unpleasant situation, but being alone with this man also made her uneasy. After their encounter in the carriage, Jasmine had decided it was best to keep her distance from him.</p>
<p>“Must I disclose my personal matters?”</p>
<p>“That depends on how personal they are.”</p>
<p>Richard spoke nonchalantly, extending his hand. After a moment’s hesitation, Jasmine reluctantly placed her hand in his. His large hand grasped her slender fingers tightly, making her resist the urge to flinch.</p>
<p>He stepped aside silently, allowing her to walk down the corridor. As his indifferent blue eyes swept past the knights, they stiffened into an attentive stance. Without a word, Richard closed the door and smiled gently at Jasmine.</p>
<p>“Shall we go?”</p>
<p>For a while, neither of them spoke. There was both too much and too little to say. Jasmine found the silence increasingly awkward.</p>
<p>Though their relationship was strained, the silence, now five minutes long, made her realize how they always managed to converse, however briefly.</p>
<p>When they were on good terms, they chatted naturally, and even during their shaky relationship, Richard, ever the gentleman, found suitable topics to discuss. Now, however, he looked straight ahead, lips sealed.</p>
<p>Unintentionally, Jasmine glanced at him and met his eyes. Though startled, she quickly averted her gaze, pretending to be unfazed. Finally, he spoke.</p>
<p>“So.”</p>
<p>His voice was lower and huskier than usual.</p>
<p>“Who is that man?”</p>
<p>Jasmine was dazed at his rich, melodious voice, then turned to him with a curious expression.</p>
<p>“I never said it was a man.”</p>
<p>“Then, is it not?”</p>
<p>“No, it is.”</p>
<p>Richard remained silent, but he didn’t seem pleased. Jasmine sighed, recalling their previous encounter.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Whatever you’re thinking, it’s not that.”</p>
<p>Her words carried a hint of irritation. How could he think she had found a new lover so quickly? True, there had been incidents over the past few months… but this time was different.</p>
<p>The thought of him assuming she was involved with someone new irritated her further. That pathetic jerk, really.</p>
<p>Jasmine sighed irritably.</p>
<p>“I need to see Sir Soyer Atlante, the Commander of the White Order.”</p>
<p>“The Minor Count of Atlante?”</p>
<p>The count, who branched off from the Marquis Atlante family to form his own lineage, was commonly referred to as “the Minor Count of Atlante” to distinguish him from the main family. Richard knew that the count was a married man. Jasmine nodded.</p>
<p>“He’s my friend’s husband, and there’s been some trouble in their household. It’s a private matter, so it’s difficult to explain…”</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t know.”</p>
<p>Richard blinked quickly. His expression seemed to brighten, although Jasmine didn’t care to examine his emotions closely. She murmured, changing the subject.</p>
<p>“I’m worried I might be taking up your time when you’re busy.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I was just taking a break.”</p>
<p>That was true. He hadn’t even gone to work, intending to rest properly. Richard had no intention of sharing this fact.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you at the peak of your busy season? I heard you were officially appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the military. Congratulations.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Richard replied politely, but his tone was curt as if to end the conversation. Jasmine, having nothing more to say, fell silent again. She didn’t want to prolong an awkward conversation with someone who didn’t want to talk to her.</p>
