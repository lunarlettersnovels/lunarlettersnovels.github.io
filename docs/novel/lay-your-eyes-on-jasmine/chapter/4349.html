            <p><strong>Chapter 5.1</strong></p>
<p>Richard had, contrary to popular belief, quite a choleric temperament that he tirelessly worked to refine and control.</p>
<p>It was partly a result of his father, the Duke’s, strict upbringing. He had been deeply shocked by the scandalous divorce and remarriage of the former Empress, his older sister at the time. He wished that his own children, who carried the Aion blood, would not repeat such a mistake.</p>
<p>Courtesy, determination, patience, composure.</p>
<p>Those were his mantras. Growing up with those principles ingrained in his heart, Richard had become the composed and controlled man he was now. It was as if even a needle wouldn’t make him flinch.</p>
<p>But did it really make sense? He was human too.</p>
<p>He sighed again.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t concentrate all day. Is something the matter?”</p>
<p>As he left the council meeting, loosening his tie, the Crown Princess Nysa followed closely beside him, starting a conversation. He glanced at her emotionlessly, then looked ahead again.</p>
<p>“A little.”</p>
<p>“Why? Did you meet Lily?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, I did.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, he wasn’t blaming Lily for his current state. Strangely enough, throughout his journey home after parting with Jasmine Liovanni, during breakfast this morning, and even as he was preparing to step onto the carriage to fulfill his official duties, <em>her </em>tearful eyes came to his mind.</p>
<p>Richard wasn’t a fool. He couldn’t have missed that she was holding back tears.</p>
<p>His guilt grew deeper. He had made a lady cry. And not just any lady, but that innocent and pure girl… Well, she wasn’t entirely innocent, her language was surprisingly sharp for someone so seemingly naive.</p>
<p>Richard massaged his temples and sighed once more.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Crown Princess Nysa, thinking that her friend was still upset over an unrequited love, patted his cheek sympathetically. She had received a wedding invitation from Lily around the same time.</p>
<p>“True, Lily is Lily. She still doesn’t know you like her? Why bother with another wedding invitation…”</p>
<p>“But we’re friends.”</p>
<p>“Friends, my foot.”</p>
<p><em>Real friends would be you and me, </em>Richard agreed in his mind. If you wanted to see true, pure friendship, you’d look at him and Nysa. No scandals there.</p>
<p>“Hey, isn’t shock therapy a thing? Didn’t you suddenly feel energized when you saw the invitation?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that.”</p>
<p>“What is it, then?”</p>
<p>“It’s not because of that.”</p>
<p>Wedding invitations… While they were certainly awkward, they were expected and anticipated events. The sudden encounter yesterday, on the other hand, had occupied his thoughts. The anger on her face as she continued to lash out…</p>
<p>“Met Lady Liovanni.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>This was likely a result of his perfectionistic tendencies that extended even to his personal relationships. He had a considerable burden due to his mistake—offending her and, moreover, the fact that she was a lady who had admired him for a long time. Just a few days ago, he had even declined a proposal from her family.</p>
<p>He had never owed anything emotionally or financially.</p>
<p>As he looked closely at his complex expression, Princess Nysa tilted her head, raising her lips in a subtle smile.</p>
<p>“Why, did you fight?”</p>
<p>“How did you know?”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Oh, such interesting news! Richard gave a disapproving look to the princess whose eyes sparkled with excitement.</p>
<p>“Why, why! Did you get mad because she turned down the proposal? You’re just unlucky? Well, that makes sense!”</p>
<p>“…She didn’t act rudely.”</p>
<p>I said that.</p>
<p>Furrowing his brow and clenching and unclenching his fist, Richard gazed off into the distance. But there was nothing more he could do.</p>
<p>The expression on Princess Nysa’s face as she watched him lost in thought turned peculiar. She wasn’t sure what had happened, but this was the first time she’d seen him so troubled over a woman other than Lily, making it quite an interesting situation.</p>
<p>“If it bothers you, why not go and see her?”</p>
<p>“It would be better not to see her from now on.”</p>
<p>However, Richard responded firmly, despite his ongoing concern.</p>
<p>It was ludicrous and impolite for her to apologize and then ask to meet again like nothing had happened. It was a ploy to alleviate his guilt.</p>
<p>“It’s better for you to stay away from me since it makes you uncomfortable when you see me.”</p>
<p>“Hey. It’s all the same circle anyway. You’re from the Duke’s family, and she’s from another Ducal family. How can you say that?”</p>
<p>“At least for a while.”</p>
<p>He wanted to do something since she seemed hurt. His previously composed face now seemed impenetrable. Princess Nysa flicked San’s forehead with her finger.</p>
<p>“Well, how about today?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“There’s a party tonight. Let’s go and have some fun. Whether it’s a misunderstanding or a mistake, drowning your sorrows in alcohol is the best way.”</p>
<p>“Go with your fiancé.”</p>
<p>“Come on! Just come!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>Jasmine, lost in thought, let out a deep sigh. Caras, her younger brother who happened to be on vacation, discreetly observed his sister again.</p>
<p>He was the commander of the Order of the Azure Knights, renowned not just within the Aion family but across the continent as a skilled knight and the chief of the Imperial Knights. However, he was nothing more than an overprotective big brother when it came to his youngest sister.</p>
<p>When Caras found out that Jasmine had a crush on the Aion Duke, and even more surprisingly, was quite supportive of her attending marriage meetings, it was due to his stance that the Duke was quite the fine gentleman, hard to find for a lady as excellent as her, that he felt it wouldn’t be a waste for her to marry him.</p>
<p>So, watching his sister’s upset state because of a man now made his stomach turn.</p>
