            <h3>Chapter 61.2</h3>
<p>It all started with chance encounters at the theater, café, and library, where they engaged in light conversation. Jasmine, feeling bored without a boyfriend, nodded in agreement as Peterson seemed decently reputable, not bad-looking, and seemed to have no major flaws in his personal life.</p>
<p>No matter who came or went, Jasmine didn’t actively block anyone, but she still kept a certain distance. Even if he developed some crush on her, there wasn’t any passionate love or attachment.</p>
<p>Jasmine became really curious and asked, “Why do you like me?”</p>
<p>Taken aback by the sudden and direct question, Peterson blushed and coughed.</p>
<p>Despite today marking exactly one week since they started dating, he was gradually gaining confidence from Jasmine’s lack of signs of breaking up.</p>
<p>“Well, who wouldn’t admire and adore the flower of society, Jasmine Liovanni?”</p>
<p>Beautiful, famous, and from a good family, it all seemed plausible. Jasmine felt upset and drained.</p>
<p>Those words seemed to nail her ears shut. The amiable Jasmine of the past might have felt embarrassed and evasive, replying cheerfully or changing the subject.</p>
<p>But the current her found such social efforts tedious, bothersome, and meaningless. Unfortunately, Peterson kept talking.</p>
<p>“We also communicate well,”</p>
<p>Do we? It’s probably because he doesn’t shut up. There aren’t any memorable conversations at all.</p>
<p>“You’re charming and cultured.”</p>
<p>Have we ever had a conversation deep enough to gauge each other’s level of sophistication?</p>
<p>“In the social circle, there’s no lady as exceptional as Lady Jasmine Liovanni.”</p>
<p>That’s probably true. Jasmine had worked hard since she was sixteen, striving to become an impressive and remarkable person, admired for her intelligence and beauty.</p>
<p>To her, each day was fulfilling and joyful because she finally had a goal. And that goal was…</p>
<p>“Jasmine, the war at the border is over.”</p>
<p>“The Duke will return.”</p>
<p>“That’s what came out at the Royal Palace this morning. The negotiations have already concluded, and it might take about four days for…”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s heart suddenly sank like a stone. She felt a discomforting sensation.</p>
<p>But she smiled like a flower.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the compliment.”</p>
<p>“No, so Jasmine…”</p>
<p>“So, Lord Peterson,” Jasmine called his name softly and smoothly.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop seeing each other.”</p>
<p>She had experienced such moments several times before, and each time, they took a toll on her emotionally. Despite not actively blocking potential suitors, this situation doesn’t change.</p>
<p>Yet, she continued to play in this game of romance, even though she didn’t particularly enjoy it. Why did she keep repeating this futile cycle?</p>
<p>She tried not to think about it too deeply, bu this time, Jasmine finally questioned herself.</p>
<p>Why continue with something so unproductive and not particularly joyful?</p>
<p>The old her would have probably found such behavior repulsive.</p>
<p>Jasmine blinked. Perhaps it was because she had become susceptible to impulse. She had always resolved to restrain herself, think more carefully, and avoid irresponsible behavior.</p>
<p>However, recently, Jasmine had let go of all that control and lived as her heart desired. It felt more liberating and exciting.</p>
<p>Ah, so that’s why people said I was living a boring life, she thought.</p>
<p>However, this moderate indulgence only temporarily alleviated her chronic boredom and provided a bit of freshness.</p>
<p>It was enjoyable, but once the moment passed, it felt even emptier. So, to distract herself from the void, she entered another relationship. But the unfillable void grew larger, leading to a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Yes, a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Only then did Jasmine have to admit to herself. I’ve been doing something futile.</p>
<p>‘I’ don’t like or have any interest in relationships that don’t exist in my heart.</p>
<p>The repressed feelings of frustration surged, but like a dam that was released, Jasmine’s complicated mind eased a bit.</p>
<p>She sighed and looked up, then approached the man who would be her ninth ex-boyfriend in the past six months.</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>She had nothing more to add. It would be excuses anyway. Even though the other person knew, they would feel awkward and uncomfortable, so what’s the point of cursing or blaming?</p>
<p>Jasmine thought so and casually turned her head. She froze.</p>
<p>This open-air café was a high-end coffee house frequented by nobles and wealthy bourgeoisie. Skilled baristas and pastry chefs served high-quality coffee beans, so high-ranking nobles residing in the capital usually visited this place.</p>
<p>However, despite using this café frequently for years, Jasmine had never seen him here before. She knew he liked coffee, but he only appeared at the Green Hat House across the street once, which was frequented by gentlemen, as he didn’t like crowded places.</p>
<p>Ding! The sound of bells accompanied a group of nobles entering the café. Some elderly gentlemen in silk hats, elaborately dressed noblewomen wearing thin fur coats, a few men who seemed like bureaucrats, and…</p>
<p>The man whose eyes she met, as if by fate, was Richard Aion.</p>
<p>It felt like being struck by lightning.</p>
