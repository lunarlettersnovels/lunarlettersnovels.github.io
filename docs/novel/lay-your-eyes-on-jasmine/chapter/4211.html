            <h3>Chapter 74.2</h3>
<p>Richard’s eyes, calm yet shadowed, carried a melancholic beauty like that of a poet and an otherworldly grace like that of a master swordsman. Hughke, who had been flustered, looked at his master and idol, Duke Aion, with a mix of pride and self-reflection.</p>
<p>Yes, he must have a plan. He wouldn’t waste a year for no reason. Besides, there were virtually no rivals for Richard Aion in the current political landscape of the empire.</p>
<p>Most of the opposition had been purged by the Emperor and Richard’s father in their younger days or had been decimated in the massive war Richard fought at the age of twenty. Those remaining were much older, serving more as mentors, political partners, or elders.</p>
<p>Most of them were pro-Emperor or moderate neutrals. Among his peers, there was no one who could surpass him. The few exceptions were James Liovanni, the heir of the Grand Duke Liovanni and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Count Soyer Atlante, known as the Ice Prince.</p>
<p>Well, there were a few who clashed with Richard, but calling them rivals would be an exaggeration. They were merely differences in temperament or opinion. Serving the same lord, such differences were not a big deal. At least, that’s what Hughke thought.</p>
<p>“By the way, Your Excellency, may I ask why you requested certain information during the war?”</p>
<p>Richard’s eyes narrowed. Sensing his mood, Hughke continued.</p>
<p>“If it was for the sake of the Duchess…”</p>
<p>“Sir Hughke.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You’re being excessive today.”</p>
<p>“I apologize.”</p>
<p>As his aide immediately apologized, Richard rested his chin on his hand again. He understood why people found his recent behavior strange. Even he found it laughable when he realized what he was doing. A familiar melancholy welled up within him, along with a sigh.</p>
<p>It had already been days since he last saw Jasmine.</p>
<p>What could she be doing? She better not be with those men again.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Your Excellency? The book…”</p>
<p>Realizing he had crumpled the paper without noticing, Richard calmly closed the book and put it in the drawer. Hughke’s eyes narrowed. He hadn’t been mistaken about the title…</p>
<p>Knock, knock, knock.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, I have a report…”</p>
<p>“I’m busy. Leave.”</p>
<p>Hughke glanced at the drawer again.</p>
<p>One of Richard’s aides, Schuan, hesitated before speaking.</p>
<p>“My apologies. There’s a guest in the military department…”</p>
<p>“Is the guest here to see me?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not…”</p>
<p>“Then leave.”</p>
<p>Richard nonchalantly pulled out a newspaper and began reading. Hughke’s eyes followed his superior’s gaze to the article. It was the gossip column.</p>
<p>“It’s… Lady Jasmine is here.”</p>
<p>Schuan flinched at Richard’s icy glare as he turned sharply.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The Lady Jasmine Liovanni…”</p>
<p>Richard stood up with graceful decisiveness and began putting on the coat that was draped over his armchair. Hughke, quick to notice, handed him a scarf and smoothly inquired.</p>
<p>“Are you heading to the military department?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to work?”</p>
<p>“If necessary.”</p>
<p>And with that, he was gone like the wind. Hughke stared at the closed door with regret, having struggled for an hour to get him out of his seat. Schuan, edging closer, asked.</p>
<p>“What’s up with him?”</p>
<p>“Maybe his new venture isn’t going well.”</p>
<p>“A venture? Besides the Volante investment, has he started another project?”</p>
<p>“No, not that.”</p>
<p>A romantic venture.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jasmine felt a mix of emotions as she revisited the knights’ headquarters after a long time. She used to frequent this place, but for the past six months, she hadn’t even glanced in its direction.</p>
<p>In her younger, more naive days, she would visit her with a pounding heart.</p>
<p>“How childish I was.”</p>
<p>She clicked her tongue and shook her head. What was so great about it? It was a little embarrassing, bittersweet, and amusing. While reminiscing, she headed to the commander’s office of the Azure Knights. She thought she should at least see her brother since she was here.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>“Oh! My Lady!”</p>
<p>“What brings you here, My Lady?”</p>
<p>As she entered, the busy deputy commander and Karas’s adjutant sprang up and hurriedly bowed. In the predominantly male military, the appearance of a beautiful woman was a shining event in itself. Jasmine looked around awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Where’s my brother?”</p>
<p>“Oh, the commander is training the new recruits. Shall I fetch him immediately?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>
<p>She must have come at a busy time. Jasmine, feeling a bit embarrassed, played with her hair and shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing important. I’m sorry to bother you.”</p>
<p>“Not at all! I’ll bring him right away! It’s not a problem!”</p>
<p>The deputy commander, his face flushed, shouted with intense fervor. Excited and nervous, he found himself and his superior downgraded to a trivial matter. It was an absurd situation. As the adjutant looked at her with a complex expression, Jasmine couldn’t help but burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“No, really. I came here for something else and just dropped by.”</p>
