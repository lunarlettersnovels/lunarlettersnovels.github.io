            <p><strong>Chapter 10.1</strong></p>
<p>Even at the distraught question, the duke’s expression remained one of solemn determination. Nysa contemplated for a moment.</p>
<p>“Honestly?” she said.</p>
<p>“Honestly,” Richard replied.</p>
<p>“No luck. Naturally, would a guy like you be approachable and fortunate?”</p>
<p>It was a straightforward and audacious assessment. Richard sighed. His gaze drifted aimlessly until, finally, it fixed on her. Despite the gaze that could cut like a knife, Nysa responded defiantly. He let out another sigh.</p>
<p>“Get to the point.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not kidding. Why the sudden gloom? Considering all the bad luck you’ve had so far, it should fill the entire ocean.”</p>
<p>Prodding at sensitive areas with nonchalance was Nysa’s specialty. Or perhaps it should be attributed to the royal family as a whole. Richard’s mind conjured images of his ill-tempered cousin-sister one after another as he massaged his temples.</p>
<p><em>Why do all the women around me seem to have sharpened tongues?</em></p>
<p>And the woman from yesterday, too…</p>
<p>His lips were sealed neatly.</p>
<p>His downcast eyes looked at the horse shaking its head. The horse’s wheat mane was tanned by the sun and looked yellow-gold. Coincidentally, it’s a hair color similar to yesterday’s drunkard.</p>
<p>In truth, he hadn’t grown up as impressive as one might assume, and despite enduring the rigors of the battlefield, his body bore the scars of all sorts of insults and profanities. Yet, there weren’t many things as agonizingly searing as those that were etched into his memory yesterday.</p>
<p>In that regard, Jasmine had achieved quite the feat, although she would never know.</p>
<p>“I got into a fight yesterday,” he confessed.</p>
<p>“With whom?” Nysa inquired.</p>
<p>“Some girl I know.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What are you talking about?” Nysa, disinterested in delving into the depths of her melancholic friend’s emotions, retorted nonchalantly, taking aim and firing at a bird.</p>
<p>Thunderous gunfire resonated. While this may be a hunting ground, hunting itself hardly piqued Richard’s interest. He continued to puff on his pipe, as impassive as ever.</p>
<p>“With the Lady Liovanni.”</p>
<p>“What?” Nysa exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>Despite taking careful aim, Nysa had missed the mark. With a resigned sigh, the princess handed her empty gun to her attendant and wiped the perspiration from her forehead. Finally showing a semblance of interest, her gaze swept over her friend, who remained lost in his reverie. A fascinating sight.</p>
<p>“Do you frequently cross paths with that woman?”</p>
<p>“Only twice.”</p>
<p>“Twice is probably twice too many. Except for Lily, that’s a record. You were so affected by a woman you met just once that you couldn’t forget her,” Nysa remarked.</p>
<p>“…I truly didn’t know. I even apologized.”</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, it had been a mistake, a blemish on his record. Richard possessed remarkable acumen and perceptiveness in matters that held importance or kindled his curiosity. Yet, he displayed an evident propensity for obliviousness when it came to things that failed to captivate his attention.</p>
<p>Almost as if his brain instinctively deleted what it deemed unworthy, each occurrence slipped away as soon as it happened. This dagger-like indifference occasionally came across as cold and inhuman, yet for Richard, it felt somewhat unjust. What could he do if it was simply his nature? …Of course, it didn’t mean he was exempt from error.</p>
<p>“Still, you’re quite the character, aren’t you? It’s quite harsh that the girl drowned herself with wine because of you. She should’ve given you a slap, you know. That would have been a clean ending.”</p>
<p>“Are you teasing me?”</p>
<p>“Did you catch on?”</p>
<p>Richard ignored her antics and inhaled his pipe. Today, for some reason, his mouth felt particularly dry. Nysa discreetly approached him, murmuring.</p>
<p>“You look a little disturbed.”</p>
<p>To his surprise, he was.</p>
<p>Jasmine said things out of anger, of inebriation even. She was a woman who had nothing to do with him. He didn’t think her words were worth dwelling more or getting frustrated about, yet here he was, still hung up about it. It was a problem.</p>
<p>That was the second time they exchanged words. But each time they met, Jasmine managed to turn his insides. She was quite something, in her own way.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps that’s how she pricked at his core, exposing his vulnerabilities. Richard let out a bitter laugh. Jasmine’s past affections ran deep, considering how she could prod the painful parts of him other people didn’t even know.</p>
<p><em>“It’s only natural to dislike someone you once genuinely liked.”</em></p>
<p>How many years would emotions have to ebb and flow before a face that had once been purely adoring turned into one that was wounded and tearful, eventually yelling in apparent hatred?</p>
<p>He couldn’t fathom. He didn’t understand such intense and passionate emotions from Jasmine.</p>
<p>Of course, he loves Lily just as much, but if you asked him whether it’s so overwhelming that it makes him lose control, he wouldn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>Although heartbreak can be painful, he had confidence that time would heal it, and he considered that a considerate and sensible way to preserve the remnants of their friendship.</p>
<p>Following Nysa’s insights, he pondered whether he, as a person, was inherently insensitive. Was his reserved nature a result of his inherent disposition?</p>
<p>In truth, he didn’t know for sure, but it would be accurate to say he hadn’t experienced such intense passion very often. Or perhaps he had preemptively suppressed it before it could reach a boiling point.</p>
<p>His father, who had raised him with strict principles, had taught and influenced him through methods like these: how to maintain composure, how to differentiate between public and private matters, how to restrain impulses and emotions that couldn’t be managed responsibly, and what was right and wrong. This upbringing fostered discernment and guided his actions.</p>
<p>Thanks to his father’s guidance, Richard became a leader of a prominent noble house, a knight, and a gentleman, all according to his vision. He lived by the values he had set, operated logically, connected with others, and stood firm without wavering. He never compromised his honor or betrayed trust, earning respect wherever he went.</p>
