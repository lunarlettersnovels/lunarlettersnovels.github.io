            <h3>Chapter 66.1</h3>
<p>If the underlying cause isn’t resolved, what’s the point of adding new, pretty things to it? Nothing will change. The same situation will just repeat itself. Unless one of them, or both, adjusts or changes, this pattern will continue.</p>
<p>Back then, she was too exhausted to think clearly, but now that she could look at things rationally, she became more skeptical. Time and distance can cleanse a brain steeped in emotions, making it usable again. Thanks to this, she was able to think very coolly.</p>
<p>‘I know that he and I get along quite well. We have a great physical connection, we have fun together, we share similar hobbies and tastes, and our conversations flow smoothly. Judging by how Richard still seems to have lingering feelings, he probably thinks the same.’</p>
<p>But that one trivial point, that one thing that doesn’t quite fit, is too significant to ignore.</p>
<p>‘He’s lived his whole life that way. What am I to change him? Can he even change? I’m not sure if it’s right to want this.’</p>
<p>This might be a selfish and one-dimensional desire. After all, who is perfect? She was full of flaws herself. Maybe the right thing is to adjust and go along.</p>
<p>But thinking back, no clear conclusion came. There were lines she couldn’t tolerate being crossed, and Richard had crossed those lines several times that day alone.</p>
<p>Jasmine couldn’t accept situations where her will and self were not respected, and she wouldn’t keep someone who made her feel that way close.</p>
<p>In truth, if she didn’t love Richard, she wouldn’t have fought so loudly that night.</p>
<p>Normally, Jasmine would have ended the relationship quickly and moved on. But she wanted to know him better, ask about his thoughts, reflect on their relationship, and stay with him longer.</p>
<p>In retrospect, that was Jasmine’s courage and attempt. It wasn’t just about venting anger; she wanted to solve this problem with him.</p>
<p>With a bitter aftertaste, Jasmine rubbed her forehead. Her chest felt heavy. She was surprised that a faint pain still lingered. Maybe it was because she had met him today. She coughed lightly and rubbed her chest.</p>
<p>Although it ended in failure, she didn’t regret trying. She did her best in her own way. Clumsy and now, in hindsight, full of regrets, but still. She really tried hard for her love. Because she liked him. So, even though there were lessons learned, there were no regrets.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>What Jasmine didn’t know was how strong and persistent her attraction to Richard was.</p>
<p>Even if she washed and washed her clothes on the beach, grains of sand kept coming out. It was similar to how thoughts of him kept resurfacing, showing up when she least expected it, making it unbearable.</p>
<p>When she saw him, her senses were overwhelmed. Sometimes, just his presence pulled her in and made her feel consumed. She felt him instinctively. From the first moment, Jasmine felt that pull and recognized him.</p>
<p>At one point, she thought it was fate, but now she wondered if this feeling was more like how a male and female of a species are drawn to each other during mating season.</p>
<p>Otherwise, why would she be so helplessly attracted to him by just a word, a glance, or a touch after all this time?</p>
<p>Her throat was dry, and she was thirsty. Her heart was racing, and her blood was flowing fast. For a moment, she was so focused on him that she couldn’t even feel her usual subtle emptiness and boredom.</p>
<p>And with that simple satisfaction came an equally strong, or perhaps even greater, fear and rejection.</p>
<p>She didn’t want this, and she didn’t want to get more entangled, but she couldn’t ignore it. She was aware of him, and it bothered her.</p>
<p>‘What should I do? Am I really doomed in this life?’</p>
<p>But even so, she didn’t want to start over with him.</p>
<p>This was clear and resolute.</p>
<p>And Jasmine knew this fact was firm enough that it wouldn’t change easily.</p>
<p>She had lived her life being considered easygoing, but she had never failed to decisively cut off inappropriate relationships. She never looked back or reversed her decisions. Why would Richard be any different?</p>
<p>Jasmine reaffirmed her resolve.</p>
<p>‘No. I’ve done enough. I won’t go through that again.’</p>
<p>Shaking her head, she decided to send letters to her friends. Let’s have a pajama party tonight after a long time!</p>
<p>There was a nominal reason. After all, Jasmine had just broken up with someone today. Even though there had been so many breakups that she should be indifferent by now, still!</p>
<p>Messengers from noble families quickly spread out to various mansions in the capital, soon bringing back replies. The response to the invitation to have fun was swift and positive. Her enthusiastic friends never refused.</p>
