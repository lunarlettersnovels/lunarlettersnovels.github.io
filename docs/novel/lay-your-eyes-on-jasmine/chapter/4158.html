            <h3>Chapter 101.2</h3>
<p>When he proposed, had she seriously considered whether their arranged marriage would work well, when they would have children, and how she would manage and maintain the household and finances as the Duchess?</p>
<p>Jasmine, being from a grand ducal family herself and having the knowledge she had acquired, would have somehow adapted. But could she have truly been an ideal, beloved wife and a respected mother?</p>
<p>If that balance were to falter, they could have ended up as a typical show-window couple in society, each living separate lives, or as a pair who merely aged side by side in a detached, convenient arrangement.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s thoughts wandered to the possibility of a child being ill, difficulties with pregnancy, or even a situation like this where a husband might stray. But catching Richard’s gaze, she quickly dismissed those thoughts.</p>
<p>It felt unfair to entertain such ideas when he had just passionately insisted that he wasn’t that kind of man. Respecting his earnestness, Jasmine realized it wasn’t right to jump to such conclusions.</p>
<p>Then she pondered the opposite: could she love only one man for her entire life?</p>
<p>Her eyes widened at the thought. The concept of family was a worldview-altering notion.</p>
<p>Jasmine had always had very few people she felt romantic feelings for. But would that remain true in the future? Just a year ago, who would have imagined Jasmine become the “Seven Day Lily,” living a life where she neither stopped men from coming nor going?</p>
<p>It’s impossible to predict what life will be like in middle age or old age from the vantage point of the present.</p>
<p>Jasmine grew serious. What if she ended up being one of those noblewomen who had affairs later in life?</p>
<p>Although she thought it unlikely given her past romantic experiences, one could never be too sure. With her tendency to act impulsively when deeply attracted, she might find herself unable to resist a passionate pull, leading to a divorce rather than an affair, claiming she’d rather divorce than cheat.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, what are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>Wow, unbelievable. Jasmine, who had been chuckling inwardly, noticed Richard had been watching her intently and gave an awkward smile.</p>
<p>“Nothing. I was just thinking it’s a good thing I didn’t marry early.”</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly thinking about that?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Jasmine trailed off, fiddling with her skirt. She realized how much she had changed. Maybe it was age or finally gaining some maturity.</p>
<p>She thought that getting married with a vague resolve was a bad idea, and she questioned whether marriage was even necessary. Looking at life from a realistic perspective, it certainly seemed that way.</p>
<p>Most of her friends had their own careers and weren’t thinking about marriage immediately, but they had discussed it. Most of them, due to their values, businesses, or family reasons, thought about marriage at least once, but it wasn’t necessarily about an ideal marriage.</p>
<p>“Marriage? Of course, I should. As long as we respect each other’s privacy, have good chemistry in bed, and he can benefit my family and business. I need an heir, so he should have good genes to pass on to my child.”</p>
<p>Lichang spoke under the pretext of finding a business investment partner who could relatively maintain her lifestyle:</p>
<p>“A kind and family-oriented person. I like someone who actively supports my work. It would be great if they could also take good care of the baby during my postpartum period.”</p>
<p>Nikki, on the other hand, wanted a reasonably realistic and traditional husband:</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Of course, it’s about physical compatibility! Someone romantic who makes me feel passionate! If that’s not right, why get married? My dream is to marry my lifelong muse. And every night be very…”</p>
<p>The passionate Aisha smiled bashfully and mischievously:</p>
<p>“Of course, I have to get married to produce an heir for our family. A man who is good at supporting me, strong, and healthy. It would be even better if he has the skills to not lose to me in a sparring match. And if he’s good in bed, even better.”</p>
<p>Julia, the head of a prestigious frontier noble family, yawned and said, “It’s bothersome, but it must be done.”</p>
<p>And Jasmine… at the time, she had no particular thoughts. She was not the heir to inherit the family, being the youngest, and she had no separate business to run or dreams that required spousal support.</p>
<p>Moreover, our family was not in urgent need of a political marriage. She had no lack of abilities that would necessitate relying on someone else. Therefore, Jasmine might appear to others as someone who was born with the best of luck.</p>
<p>Despite having no real reason to endure marriage, there were plenty of people who desired her. She was simply endlessly free.</p>
<p>However, precisely because of this, she never needed to seriously contemplate marriage. She realized this only now. If her feelings towards Richard were not purely personal, the duke wouldn’t have bothered to send a marriage proposal to the duchy. Jasmine furrowed her brow seriously.</p>
