<p><strong>Chapter 12.1</strong></p>
<p>“To put it bluntly, Lord Charles, compared to you, is of lower rank. He must know it himself, right? You should be at the level of a noble or even a king of a small kingdom.”</p>
<p><em>Yeah, like that Duke Aion, for example.</em> Jasmine swallowed her words.</p>
<p>“But he’s not even a lord, he’s a younger son. Does that even make sense? He must be handling his own affairs. So, he might be more hesitant.”</p>
<p>If things went well between Jasmine and Charles, it would be a rapid rise in status from Lichang’s perspective.</p>
<p>Of course, for such a result to happen, Jasmine, the Forbidden Orchid of the Grand Duke’s family, would have to be deeply smitten with Charles to the point where no one else would do. But that’s unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>“Besides, it’s well-known that you liked Duke Aion. He won’t expect you to fall for him immediately. Just accept what he offers and decline when necessary. Simply being his first date partner would be an honor for that man.”</p>
<p>“He doesn’t seem to be the type to gossip behind my back, is he?”</p>
<p>“Well, you never know.”</p>
<p>Gossiping, whether it’s a man or woman, is something everyone does. And sometimes, men’s comments about women can be more blatant and messy. Richard knew that such cheap guys were easy to spot, but Charles was a bit ambiguous. After all, who can truly know what’s inside a person?</p>
<p>“Anyway, do as you wish, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>It can be quite burdensome to decline.</p>
<p>Jasmine, recalling her conversation with her friend, hesitated for a moment, then looked at the friendly man sitting in front of her.</p>
<p><em>Half a day wouldn’t hurt…</em></p>
<p>“Well then, shall we?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Richard had been exceptionally busy lately. As a military officer of the Empire, he had assumed most of the administrative responsibilities, as the substitute for the aging Oliver, the Grand Marshal.</p>
<p>Considering Richard’s youth and capabilities, he could have assumed the role of Grand Marshal long ago. However, public opinion still regarded him as too young, so his retirement as the current Grand Marshal was gradually being postponed.</p>
<p>Lord Oliver, older and having served in various positions, often complained about his aching back and withdrew from most of the work, leaning on his cane. One phrase he frequently repeated when he saw his young successor was:</p>
<p>“Why haven’t you married yet? Those old fogies keep bothering you because you’re not married yet. Being unmarried means instability. It’s pathetic.”</p>
<p>In essence, he wanted Richard to get married quickly so he could retire. Richard would merely raise the corners of his mouth and pretend not to hear. He appeared polite and humble, but he had a stubborn streak. As the Minister of Military Affairs, he could only nod and hold back his tongue.</p>
<p>Despite the continent having entered a period of stability after the war, there were occasional military skirmishes with pirates and the neighboring nation of Jiosen, so defense could not be neglected.</p>
<p>After planning this year’s large-scale military exercises and briefing the Emperor, Richard still had his responsibilities as Duke Aion. He was not only the effective commander of the Imperial Army but also the head of the prestigious Aion Duke’s family.</p>
<p>Although he had many secretaries and aides to assist with his workload, unfortunate timing resulted in numerous reports on land taxes, investments, and family holdings coinciding within a month.</p>
<p>Richard was not the type to delegate work to his subordinates, so naturally, his late nights became more frequent.</p>
<p>Working diligently every day, and with overtime, he had finally completed all the tasks. A month had passed since then, and the weather had become noticeably warmer and hotter. He loosened his tie, feeling the warmth in the air.</p>
<p>He gazed at the deepening red hue of the roses that had bloomed beautifully by the window, their fragrance reaching its peak. Then, his attention shifted to a colorful butterfly fluttering around.</p>
<p>Strangely, the face of someone he hadn’t thought of in a while suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>Could she be likened to the deep red roses of May?</p>
<p>He absentmindedly observed the colorful butterfly circling around. That night, she had worn a butterfly mask. Just like that butterfly.</p>
<p>Richard furrowed his brow slightly at the unwelcome memory. The uncomfortable feeling had lingered for a few days before being overshadowed by his overwhelming workload.</p>
<p>With a slightly troubled expression, he rose from his seat. It seemed like he was tired. He needed a drink. He briefly considered calling Nysa, but suddenly, even that seemed like too much trouble.</p>
<p><em>‘It would be better to take a hot bath and open that wine I received as a gift…’</em></p>
<p>“How was the party yesterday? Was it okay?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t bad. That lady was different from what I expected.”</p>
<p>The Duke, whose nerves had been somewhat on edge, raised his head upon overhearing a conversation that would usually go unnoticed. The palace was vast, with nobles gathering in open halls or salons, hosting parties and tea gatherings with card games and drinks. Dozens of light card games and tea parties happened every day.</p>
<p>After all, it was May, the peak of social activities.</p>
