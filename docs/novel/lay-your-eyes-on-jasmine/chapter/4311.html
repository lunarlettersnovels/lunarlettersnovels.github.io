            <h3><strong>Chapter 24.2</strong></h3>
<p><em>I want to know more. More. More.</em></p>
<p><em>Even if you’re flawed, vile, and dangerous, or even if you look like a fool. Anything. Give me all the parts of you that others don’t know. The you that I don’t know.</em></p>
<p><em>Even if it’s not enough, even if you find yourself disatisfactory—I’m okay with it.</em></p>
<p>Jasmine placed her arms around his neck and arched her back, pressing her forehead against his as she felt an incoming cl!max.</p>
<p>Richard, holding her trembling body, clenched his jaw as he thrust powerfully one last time. Her rigid back muscles and butt0cks tensed as he ravaged her gushing canal. They couldn’t hold back the groans and m0ans at their intense coupling.</p>
<p>She couldn’t remember what they were saying, as if they lost their minds. They kissed and rocked against each other, their mouths finding every inch of each other’s bodies.</p>
<p>“Ah, is this good?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Yes! I love it!”</p>
<p>“Haah, d@mn… I do too.”</p>
<p>He whispered with a growl. His greedy motions, pulling her arched waist back until his meat penetrated her quivering, gushing womanhood, were lascivious.  Jasmine cried as she felt her climax build inside and finally explode. Her p!ssy clenched, and her body arched as she rode out her 0rgasm wrapped around Richard’s pulsating member.</p>
<p>After what felt like a thunderbolt had passed through them, they both collapsed onto the bed, her inner walls still slightly clenching from the aftershock around his pulsing member. They listened to each other’s racing heartbeats as they tried to catch their breaths.</p>
<p>He held her firmly, gently lifting her bottom from his member. As their bodies were parted, her nectar slowly flowed beneath her. The scent of their lovemaking was thick.</p>
<p>He laid her back down on the bed. Jasmine, who was devoid of energy, blinked and felt his soothing touch as he stroked her sensitive frame. She smiled,</p>
<p><em>This is so different. The atmosphere while we had sex and after sex was utterly different.</em></p>
<p>She gazed oddly at him, resting her chin on his firm chest as the man tenderly ran his fingers through her hair. He appeared lethargic but predatory, like a satisfied wild beast. She blinked slowly and then, out of the blue, asked.</p>
<p>“Is this how you’re usually like?”</p>
<p>Richard, his fingers twirling her tousled golden hair, paused. “What do you mean?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It’s just that you look different when we do <em>it</em> and when we don’t.”</p>
<p>Jasmine, unable to utter “s3x,” hesitated and groaned. Richard smirked when he found his red ears buried under her rich golden hair. What a lovely lady.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“It’s a lot different…”</p>
<p>“Then let’s do that. Again and again.”</p>
<p>Richard kissed her forehead and replied in a gentle tone. She couldn’t help but swallow her saliva as she stared at his face. He looked impeccable despite his tousled hair. She still couldn’t quite get used to it.</p>
<p>This perfect man, someone she had only admired from afar for seven years, was now in this moment with her. Honestly, it still felt surreal. Of course, the reality hit her strongly as they engaged in passionate lovemaking, but he had given her the confirmation she needed, even if it was forced.</p>
<p><em>Unbelievable. I must be crazy.</em></p>
<p>If her father found out, he would probably be livid. She felt like sighing.</p>
<p>Honestly, Jasmine herself was also taken aback by what she had done. She had no idea that she had this impulsive side to her. She couldn’t entirely blame it on the alcohol. Her pent-up emotions and her brash and bold courage played a significant role.</p>
<p>In truth, last night felt like a matter of life or death. She had been desperate and urgent. Her feelings had grown so strong that a dam had burst, rushing toward him. And, unexpectedly, he had responded.</p>
<p>Just like a lazy cat, Jasmine lay on her side, her cheek against his broad shoulder, murmuring. It must be the magic of s3x. After intertwining their bodies, words flowed easily.</p>
<p>If people usually talk with closed doors and through windows, this moment felt to her like a door had been thrown wide open.</p>
<p>“… How did we end up like this? It’s amazing.”</p>
<p>She heard a low chuckle above her head. She listened to the pleasant sound.</p>
<p>“I’m not such an impressive guy who could reject the bold advances of the brave Lady Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Richard laughed simmered out. There was a pause before he said, “I guess I’m a bit of a shameful man.”</p>
<p>It was something he had never done before. His gaze that had been focused on Jasmine had returned to his usual self. The original Duke Richard Aion.</p>
<p>His eyes were either half-spirited or wide open, and they were neat, a stark contrast to his twisted gaze. Who would have thought? Even if one examines him closely, these qualities remain in a man who appears as straightforward as a line.</p>
<p>He must be slightly upset that she tried to run away earlier.</p>
<p>Jasmine stared at him blankly and asked, “Do you regret it?”</p>
