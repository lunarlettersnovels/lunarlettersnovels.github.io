            <p><strong>Chapter 26.1</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine was sitting on his lap. Upon hearing that she liked fishing, Richard raised an eyebrow in surprise.</p>
<p>“Really? I thought you had no interest at all,” he said.</p>
<p>“Oh? How about going together later? I’ll show you how to catch big fish.”</p>
<p>Jasmine, fueled by a competitive spirit, snorted in response, and he chuckled. He now gently ran his fingers through her curly blonde hair as if it had become a habit.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll consider that dinner is on you that day. I’ll treat you.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Can you cook, too?”</p>
<p>“After spending four years in a military academy, four years in the army, and another three years during my mercenary days, I had to learn to cook if I didn’t want to starve.”</p>
<p>“Fortunately, you won’t be going hungry anytime soon,” Richard mumbled softly before leaning down to give her a short, sweet kiss. Jasmine felt warm at his reassurance not to worry about eating.</p>
<p>“That’s quite surprising. You don’t look like someone who would even bake a piece of bread.”</p>
<p>“Do you see me as that incapable?”</p>
<p>“Well, you appear only to have one thing on your mind. Cooking is not necessary unless you’re passionate about it. They say that cooking and baking are trendy in high society.”</p>
<p>Jasmine shrugged, and Richard responded by playfully biting her lower lip and softly kissing her. Her cheeks flushed, but despite that, she didn’t mind. He gazed at her silently, his fingers gently caressing the curves between her slim waist and hips. His touch was delicate as if he were handling something precious.</p>
<p>“Right now, I feel like doing anything to please you.”</p>
<p>His low whisper was faint but distinct. Jasmine couldn’t help but kiss him back. His jaw tightened. His desire for her awakened. Even if they had made love earlier, the once-dormant desire within them was fully aflame.</p>
<p>Jasmine couldn’t steady her trembling body, and Richard closed his eyes, lost in the pleasure of burying himself within her. Her swaying white breasts pressed against his muscular chest as they molded together.</p>
<p>M*ans and sighs filled the air, blending with the cacophony of the creaking bed. In the throes of passion, their ecstatic cries mingled.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah!”</p>
<p>“The more we do it, the more…”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Haah…”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As Jasmine reminisced about the passionate moments and their wanton m8ans from the night before. Her ears tingled with the memory. She lightly slapped her flushed cheek, still feeling somewhat exhausted.</p>
<p>How many times did they do it last night? It was quite an impressive feat to keep doing it while in secrecy.</p>
<p>Gradually, they became less selective about locations and less concerned about being discreet. It started to feel risky. After initially confining their encounters to their respective bedrooms, dressing rooms, and bathrooms, they quickly moved on to a hasty rendezvous in Jasmine’s sitting room, using the excuse of a bright noon tea time.</p>
<p>No one had walked in on them, but it was still a precarious starting point for a relationship that now extended from night until day.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Richard? What brings you here?”</p>
<p>At first, it had been a seemingly affectionate and friendly tea time. It was around two in the afternoon, a time they had implicitly agreed was for personal relaxation before the formal evening parties that they would attend as part of high society.</p>
<p>Someone had knocked on the door, and as Jasmine looked at Richard standing there, she asked him in surprise.</p>
<p>“I believe you like Jasmine tea, right? It seems like your kind of thing.”</p>
<p>“I like Jasmine.”</p>
<p>She almost dropped the teapot. Startled, Jasmine turned to look at him, and he simply smiled, raising his eyebrows slightly. Jasmine tea, he meant.</p>
<p>“It has a nice fragrance and taste.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it has a good taste.”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s cheeks turned red as she stared at him intensely. Honestly, she didn’t even know what she was saying. And, in her embarrassment, she didn’t notice his dark blue eyes observing her intently as she blushed from her cheeks down to her neck.</p>
<p>Gradually, he moved closer and sat down next to her, his fingers lightly touching her wrist under the lace-covered cuffs of her dress. He playfully brushed the tender skin on the inside of her wrist with his fingertips, sending shivers down her spine as he spoke.</p>
<p>“It’s so delicious, I can’t stop thinking about it.”</p>
<p><em>‘Even in broad daylight…’</em></p>
<p>The fragrant Jasmine tea leaves fell to the floor as the sweet scent filled the air, capturing their attention. In an instant, like a beast unleashed, his desire surged, and before they knew it, they were kissing passionately.</p>
<p>He pulled her thighs to him, causing her to stumble. Richard pressed his firm lips sensually between her spread thighs. As their heated breaths swallowed their moans, Jasmine grabbed his hair and let out a soft whimper. She felt helpless.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah! It’s daytime!”</p>
<p>“So what? Does it matter?”</p>
<p>Not when they were both so consumed. Richard chuckled lazily as he tossed aside his shirt. Finally, she realized that ever since he had arrived, he had been filled with desire, consistent and unwavering.</p>
<p>That was his purpose from the start. Jasmine was amazed by his unceasing savageness.</p>
<p>“Only at night… night! What if someone comes in?”</p>
<p>“I have it under control. I’ll just… keep going.”</p>
