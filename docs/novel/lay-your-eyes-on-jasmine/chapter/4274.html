            <h3><strong>Chapter 43.1</strong></h3>
<p>On this midsummer night, the indigo sky was adorned with sparkling stars. Jasmine looked up at the sky, contemplating how, just a few weeks ago, she couldn’t have imagined herself walking hand in hand with Richard. It felt oddly magical.</p>
<p>In the past, being with him would make her heart race, and the tension was palpable. Now, she found herself lost in constant thoughts about the future of their relationship and his intentions.</p>
<p>As they walked silently, the conversations she overheard in the morning invaded her mind.</p>
<p><em>“…I’m worried that the timing is too rushed.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I have to get Jasmine’s permission. She might be embarrassed if I suddenly proposed.”</em></p>
<p>Jilian’s words were valid. They were in a hurry, and almost rushed into an accident. Reflecting on herself just a few days ago, their relationship seemed rushed and unstable. Even Jilian, who had supported Jasmine and Richard’s marriage, expressed concern.</p>
<p>Jasmine shared the same thoughts. She was cautious about moving forward in a hasty relationship. She pondered a lot, and she still couldn’t believe she was in a relationship with Sir Richard all because she lost control of her emotions on a drunken night.</p>
<p>It had been nearly seven years since she had looked at Richard this way. From Jasmine’s perspective, it felt more like a dream rather than feeling fluttery and fresh, like the early stages of a typical relationship. She didn’t show it outwardly, but internally, it was overwhelming.</p>
<p>‘<em>A proposal? What could be going on in Richard’s mind?’</em></p>
<p>Looking down at Richard kissing the back of her hand, her confusion with his motives intensified. No matter how much she pondered, she couldn’t understand his heart. From Jasmine’s point of view, there were only two possible reasons for him to go to such lengths:</p>
<p>One: Besides the prince’s “request,” he genuinely liked Jasmine.</p>
<p>Two: Out of duty, he felt responsible for the innocent daughter of a prominent noble family he spent the first night with.</p>
<p>Or perhaps both.</p>
<p>In the end, Richard was also a noble. He’s a relative of the imperial family, the leader of a grand noble family who could execute rational decisions, strategies, and even political marriages if necessary. The Richard Jasmine knew from before was more like that kind of person.</p>
<p>After his student days, Richard had hardly socialized with others, focused on his work, abstained from excessive drinking, and hadn’t shown any signs of personal life beyond occasionally hunting and riding with Princess Nysa.</p>
<p>Even for leisure, he stayed confined in the mansion reading books or went on vacation alone to his private cottage with a fishing spot. Only on the eve before he returned to work would he return to the capital and rejuvenate in the tastes of noble ladies.</p>
<p>Does that make him a perfect man? It was too simple. So, everyone naturally assumed that the Duke Aion would have a strategic marriage when the time was right.</p>
<p>Even though romantic marriages had become more common, Richard clearly showed little interest in the opposite sex. Jasmine thought the same. If he were to marry a woman who met the criteria for a strategic alliance but not necessarily someone he loved, then it would be her.</p>
<p><em>He may not be interested in me, but still, I like him. Since no one else is in sight, it’s fine if it happens that way,</em> she thought.</p>
<p>But the result was a rejection, and it hit her even harder.</p>
<p>No matter what the conditions were, there was no way Jasmine could be left out of the entire empire. Why then? It was not about her being special. If not, then why? Eventually, she found out the reason, but that came later.</p>
<p>In any case, if he had changed his mind, that night changed everything. With a personality as naive as Richard’s, it was only natural for him to feel responsible towards the woman who had impulsively approached him <em>twice</em> despite his refusals.</p>
<p>The Prince, who desired the union of two noble families, was also satisfied. Their compatibility in the bedroom was amazing, to the point where they developed feelings. If things did not work out well with Lily, and the timing was appropriate, it made sense to resume their broken engagement.</p>
<p>For Richard, there was nothing to lose. Politically and morally, it was a perfect decision. What a wise judgment it was.</p>
<p>Jasmine gradually began to understand, and at the same time, her heart grew colder. In this chilled state, holding hands with him felt strangely warm.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was highly improbable if these reasons were not the only ones… If Richard Aion had a reason to pursue marriage so quickly, there was only one possible explanation.</p>
<p>Because he loved her. And to an uncontrollable extent.</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a laugh burst out, and Jasmine quickly covered her mouth. Suppressing a mischievous laughter, she cleared her throat. Her thoughts were absurd even to herself, or perhaps her secretly hopeful and desperate expectation made her feelings awkward and amusing.</p>
<p>The two of them had already come to a halt. The cool breeze of the night, imbued with the fragrance of the forest, brushed past their cheeks. Richard stared intently at Jasmine.</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Jasmine hesitated slightly, trying to articulate her thoughts. Naturally, she still had her pride and wasn’t without self-respect to spill out everything.</p>
<p>“Just a few days ago, I didn’t expect to hold your hand like this. It’s a bit amusing.”</p>
