            <p><strong>Chapter 57.2</strong></p>
<p>When he first set out for that castle, he thought it would be a leisurely journey, but how did he end up in such hardship? It was all because of those foolish idiots from JIosen.</p>
<p>‘Still, thanks to them, I’ve gained some points with His Majesty. The job was done smoothly, saving time as well.’</p>
<p>This war, whether long or short-term, had its benefits. Although his body was tired, and he missed his fiancée, whom he hadn’t seen frequently due to his obligations, Jilian was content. And…</p>
<p>“Finally, the entire military will fall into your grasp. With this achievement, no one can oppose it anymore.”</p>
<p>Isn’t that right?</p>
<p>“Duke Aion.”</p>
<p>Glancing back, Jilian saw a cold-faced man, his mouth shut tight, staring straight ahead while holding the reins of his black horse. Under the dark blue velvet hood, his focus was slightly distant.</p>
<p>In truth, he had spoken very little throughout the war. He was never much of a talker anyway. But he was more subdued than at the beginning of the war. In this moment of respite, Jilian found this somewhat concerning.</p>
<p>It was probably just fatigue, Jilian clicked his tongue. Richard spoke up a tad bit late.</p>
<p>“Your Highness.”</p>
<p>“Why.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to rest.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Rest. You haven’t had a proper rest since you came of age, have you?”</p>
<p>Jilian felt sympathy as he realized that even this guy was mentally fatigued. Even someone engrossed in work needed rest sometimes.</p>
<p>Should he grant him leave? Maybe a month off would do? Or perhaps two? More lenient and responsible than before, Jilian suggested.</p>
<p>But Richard’s words were not yet finished.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>A radical declaration followed his calm voice.</p>
<p>“For the next year, don’t come looking for me. Whatever you ask, I won’t do it.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>As Jilian stared in astonishment, dumbfounded, Richard remained indifferent. It seemed he had already said what he needed to as he squinted slightly, gazing into the air.</p>
<p>A gray hawk swiftly flew from the direction he was gazing, deftly alighting on his arm amidst chirps and bird calls. His fingers gently scratched the feathered falcon’s jaw as he untied the letter from its feet and unfolded it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gillian, still perplexed, furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>“You’re planning to take a year off? At such an important time like this?”</p>
<p>“When has it not been important? Since I became a duke, there hasn’t been a single day that wasn’t crucial.”</p>
<p>Indeed, that was true. It had been almost seven or eight years since he had tirelessly worked to secure the national interest of the empire, stabilize his position as a duke, and strengthen the position of his lord, the Crown Prince.</p>
<p>Even if the Emperor and Crown Prince pressed him hard, he had never decided to take a break.</p>
<p>Jillian sighed briefly as he observed his cousin, who focused solely on the letter and looked blank.</p>
<p>In fact, during these past six months of resolving border conflicts, many events have occurred. For the first time, there have been major arguments and discord among the soldiers.</p>
<p>Jilian was paying the price for his arrogance in not knowing his cousin well—yes, despite having known him for so long.</p>
<p>Unbelievable. Richard Aion was even crazier than he had known.</p>
<p>Whether it was madness that Jilian had not known about that had emerged or whether the latent madness within him had grown into a thick fire over the years—even he did not know.</p>
<p>Perhaps the intensity was akin to dem0n!c or genius.</p>
<p>As the timing was so unfortunate, Richard had to go to the battlefield and fight in an emotionally overloaded state with unresolved issues. So he was very worried that he might be unstable.</p>
<p>Yet he hadn’t thought he would go on a rampage like this.</p>
<p>That was because he had never lost his cool so definitively and had always lost his wits in situations like this. He had wanted to quickly rid himself of these stupid antics and go to the capital.</p>
<p>Jilian laughed with disbelief. There’s not even this kind of madman among madmen.</p>
<p>He remembered Richard in the Crown Prince’s barracks, bloodied and wide-eyed, his head swiveling as he studied the strategy map amid furious shouts.</p>
<p>How can we end this war most effectively and swiftly? A determined fervor flickered in his eyes as he contemplated the optimal course of action. It was worth it.</p>
<p>After two sleepless nights spent strategizing and executing a successful surprise operation, he engaged in battle with the elite White Division of the military powerhouse Jiosen, commanding only twenty knights.</p>
<p>If he survived, he was not human.</p>
<p>Once again, he emerged victorious from that reckless gamble. Despite sustaining a major injury to his back, he considered himself fortunate compared to the audacious stunt he had pulled off.</p>
<p>He was lucky not to have perished. Gillian was astonished, his mouth agape in disbelief. There was nothing quite like this poisonous tumor.</p>
<p>“Did you go crazy because you wanted to die? Why did you do such a stupid thing? Did I tell you to commit suicide? This is a war for the fate of the nation. This is foolishness. You crazy bastard, are you even listening to me properly?”</p>
<p>“We won, so it’s all good, right?”</p>
<p>But despite bleeding profusely, he replied casually, his face indifferent. Jilian’s spine tingled in anger.</p>
