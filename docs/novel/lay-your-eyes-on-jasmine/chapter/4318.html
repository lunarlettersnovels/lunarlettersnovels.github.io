            <p><strong>Chapter 21.1</strong></p>
<p>Jasmine’s underwear grew damp.</p>
<p>“R-Richard. T-This is s-so strange… Ahh!”</p>
<p>His blue eyes, fixated on her with only a hint of a smile, were asking, “Do you like it? Is it driving you crazy?” Of course, she did. But she couldn’t bring herself to say it out loud, so she whimpered instead as his tongue gently teased her stiffened nipple.</p>
<p>It felt incredible, but the sensitivity of that peak, as his breath touched it, made it seem like he had triggered a short burst of laughter.</p>
<p>As their intense gaze met, he swiftly turned her around, grabbing her thigh and pulling her down beneath him.</p>
<p>His lips, which had been gently exploring her chest and leaving traces, now descended towards her navel. He nipped at it playfully, and as he moved lower, his mouth and tongue began to explore even more sensitive territory. She gasped, trying to stifle her moans as his touch sent shivers through her.</p>
<p>It was all too much, too fast. The situation was incredibly stimulating, and the fact that Richard was performing such passionate acts on her without reservation was shocking. She squirmed as he dipped his head lower, licking and teasing her with his tongue, driving her to a frenzied state.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Even in her heightened state, Jasmine couldn’t help but jump as his tongue grazed over her most sensitive spot.</p>
<p>Her hips arched involuntarily, and more moisture welled up. Her waist twisted, and more of her nectar gushed forth.</p>
<p>Richard paused, lifting his head to assess her. Jasmine’s small face was flushed with a mix of embarrassment, confusion, and arousal. Her breasts, wet with saliva and passion, heaved as her legs remained wide open, her most intimate area on full display.</p>
<p>The transparent wetness spread, revealing even her most secret desires. Richard, teasing and exploring between her legs with his long fingers, lifted his head to confirm her wetness, then licked his lips.</p>
<p>“Hah, damn it,” he muttered. If he couldn’t enter her soon, he might lose control altogether. Who could resist this temptation?</p>
<p>He slid his fingers over her soaked folds, and as they dipped beneath her wet panties, Jasmine’s eyes fluttered open.</p>
<p>Her tiny face, a mix of bewilderment and arousal, her breasts glistening with saliva, and her legs spread wide, her intimate area exposed as she quivered and parted her thighs further – all this drove him to an almost painful arousal.</p>
<p>He increased the pressure with his fingers, feeling her wetness as he explored, and when he tugged at her wet panties, it felt like he was tearing them away. Jasmine’s dazed mind suddenly filled with embarrassment.</p>
<p>Her chest was fine, but down there… it felt somehow… unpleasant, dirty, and bare. Despite already being exposed…</p>
<p>“Ri-Richard! Th-this… Please, take it slow,” she stammered.</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not okay!”</p>
<p>Jasmine realized too late that Richard was staring at her exposed body. She struggled to hold onto her slipping drawers, but they slid down her legs, revealing her white lingerie, making his gaze even more intense.</p>
<p>She pinched his hand, signaling him to stop and trying to cover herself.</p>
<p>Feeling her pinch, Richard winced but held her ankle firmly. He kissed her inner thigh as she squirmed, making her momentarily lose her composure.</p>
<p>Despite her efforts, her wet panties eventually slid down her legs, exposing her intimate area to him. His gaze remained relentless.</p>
<p>Jasmine squeezed his hand, attempting to cover herself, but the tingling sensation on her sensitive skin, combined with his grip, left her powerless.</p>
<p>Richard pulled her underwear down completely, revealing her completely.</p>
<p>He began to stroke her firmly, evoking pleasure and uncontrollable reactions from her.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Mm…”</p>
<p>Jasmine, sprawled on her back, stared up at his towering figure and the shadows, the intense look in his eyes, his furrowed brow, and his lips that were relentlessly driving her wild.</p>
<p>It felt surreal like she was in a dream. Richard Aion, who had pretended to be blind to her, now fiercely pursuing her, was beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with ecstasy, her heart pounding and tears welling up, she made a faint whimper. Her tear-blurred eyes, half closed, appeared to be moved and thrilled, but her flushed cheeks made her look as though she were sexually aroused.</p>
<p>This further heightened Richard’s arousal.</p>
