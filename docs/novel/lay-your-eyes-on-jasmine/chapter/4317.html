            <p><strong>Chapter 21.2</strong></p>
<p>Richard urgently removed his pants and underwear. This was when Jasmine’s second shock hit her.</p>
<p>His size was… too much.</p>
<p>It was terrifying, repulsive, and too large.</p>
<p>His veins pulsated as if they were targeting her, making animalistic movements, and Jasmine was struck with horror.</p>
<p><em>Could that really fit? It must be a joke, right?</em></p><em>
</em><p><em></em>She squirmed instinctively in fear.</p>
<p>“Richard, it might not work. This can’t be!”</p>
<p>As he moved toward her intimate area with his manho0d, which she had never seen before, Jasmine was overwhelmed with fear and struggled to escape his advances. It felt like a scene from a horror novel as if she were facing an unknown monster.</p>
<p>Even though she knew what to expect from se!x education books, it was supposed to be a wholesome source of knowledge, not this animalistic encounter. And in the illustrations, it wasn’t this big!</p>
<p>As her ample buttocks wriggled and her slender waist trembled, he intently observed her from the back. He had been watching her attempts to escape for a while, and when her firm behind twitched, he pulled her towards him.</p>
<p>Was she resisting or tempting him?</p>
<p>He easily caught Jasmine, trying to crawl away desperately, and playfully restrained her, tasting her lips with a kiss.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>He whispered into her ear, making her shriek in surprise. She struggled like a frightened bird, which was amusing and endearing at the same time.</p>
<p>As he held her firmly behind her back, Richard gently grasped her chin and turned her head to steal a passionate kiss. Any words she had been about to utter were swallowed in an instant. His skilled kisses prompted Jasmine to release sweet m0ans of delight.</p>
<p>She was a woman sensitive to pleasure, her slender neck throbbing as she arched it towards him, her plump lips tasting his with abandon, her eyes tightly shut, lost in the sensation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his erect manhood slowly penetrated her inner thigh and teased her soft buttocks. Jasmine was startled, but the strong hand holding her head in place prevented her from turning away.</p>
<p>Moving sensually up and down, their passionate movements became more intense. As their sensitive areas brushed against each other, it felt like their limbs were losing strength.</p>
<p>Gradually, their struggling ceased, and Richard, nestled between Jasmine’s parted knees, let out a heavy breath and delved into her innermost with his throbbing desire.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Uh!”</p>
<p>The intertwined bodies of the couple trembled. Jasmine was still overwhelmed with fear, but simultaneously, she was equally ar0used.</p>
<p>Behind her, Richard’s assertive thrusts and the hot touch of their mingling bodies, the fluid from his wet tip mixing with her already moist womanh0od, and the sensation of her earlobe being grazed by his restrained m0ans – all these sensations overwhelmed her.</p>
<p>Her plump lips were forced apart, and his fingers slipped inside. Instead of enduring the discomfort, Jasmine welcomed the feeling of those fingers, which moved inside her like a candy she was offering.</p>
<p>She felt like she was turning into an animal, no longer human. Jasmine had never imagined that lovemaking could be like this. It was a blend of pleasure, a strange atmosphere, his masculine scent, and blatant desire.</p>
<p>She felt like she had to do something to satisfy him.</p>
<p>She wanted to submit to his desires.</p>
<p>Like a skilled predator, he took control. His erect manho0d glided leisurely between her thighs.</p>
<p>This simulated act seemed like a practice run for what was to come, a ritual that softened the once rigid woman. Richard kissed her cheeks, the nape of her neck, and her back as he gathered her soft thighs together and then spread them apart.</p>
<p>Feeling her damp folds gently parting, Jasmine took a shaky breath.</p>
<p>Once more, he kissed her back as his fingers slid between her legs. The sensations and sounds made Jasmine gasp and grip the sheets tightly.</p>
<p>“Oh, oh! Ugh…”</p>
<p>Jasmine m0aned as his fingers pressed between her thighs. His intense blue eyes watched her surrendering form closely,</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>He whispered as he eased himself down over her back, his engorged erection grazing against her, then firmly entering her. The sensations were intense.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>Between her cries, his tongue entered her mouth, mimicking the forceful thrusts of his man0ood, which delved even deeper. It felt like a continuous rhythm.</p>
<p>Jasmine whimpered and squirmed, but with his eyes closed, Richard continued his relentless assault, biting down on her tongue and gripping her palm even harder as he pushed himself inside. The thrust was deep, evoking a m0an.</p>
<p>Between her parted thighs, fluids trickled down.</p>
