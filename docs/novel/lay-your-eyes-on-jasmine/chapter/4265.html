            <h3><strong>Chapter 47.2</strong></h3>
<p>Like a poorly tamed wolf giving up its neck, Richard immediately acknowledged and got down on his knees. A bewildered Jasmine narrowed her eyes at him, but he opened his mouth before she could say anything.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>His blue eyes flickered.</p>
<p>“Jasmine. I was wrong, please.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Can’t you forgive me just this once? I’ll be better.”</p>
<p>After a moment of hesitation, Jasmine gritted her teeth. The frustration and anger were welling up again.</p>
<p>“Why do you always make it seem so easy?”</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“It’s easy for you to reject, date, and even get married. Has it become so trivial now that even kneeling is no big deal?”</p>
<p>Nothing about you is easy for me; it’s always difficult and painful. Why is it so easy for you?</p>
<p>“Don’t think I’ll accept it just because you got down on your knees. Maybe that wasn’t your intention, but…”</p>
<p>“That’s not it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie to me. I may not know your personal life, but you don’t think I don’t know the kind of person you are? You’ll do whatever it takes to get what you want, as long as it doesn’t violate your high standards.”</p>
<p>She didn’t realize that “goal” would be me. Richard neither confirmed nor denied it; he was simply atoning like a sinner. Jasmine chewed on her lip at the silence that followed, then finally spoke up.</p>
<p>“Get up quickly. Are you mentally torturing me, or what?”</p>
<p>He slowly rose from the ground, his head hung down like a punished boy. Jasmine, annoyed and perturbed by his downcast appearance, quickly turned away.</p>
<p>“So?” Jasmine asked sharply, meeting Richard’s questioning gaze. “You said you were sorry for me. What are you sorry for?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for hurting you.”</p>
<p>His formal apology sounded noble, but it seemed like an animalistic growl to her. She scoffed.</p>
<p>“Do you even know what hurt me?”</p>
<p>“I dared to make a rude suggestion…”</p>
<p>“It’s not rude.”</p>
<p>Jasmine cut him off firmly.</p>
<p>“You are despicable.”</p>
<p>Richard couldn’t respond to her accusation. Because it was true. Even in his irrational state, he was still rational enough to be almost demonic.</p>
<p>It was his defense mechanism. When a problem arose, he sought the best and quickest solution. As if playing chess, as if instinctively stabbing at the enemy’s weakness in military strategy, he responded to Jasmine in that way.</p>
<p>Jasmine liked him. She showed an indulgent tolerance to his unreasonable demands and desires, fueled by her deep and strong affection for him. She made an effort to understand him first in any situation. She was always honest and kind.</p>
<p>Richard felt the warmth of being loved daily, and his cold heart tingled. It had been so long since she had been marinated in such sweetness, so long since she had experienced such affection.</p>
<p>So, he orchestrated a hostage situation using her emotions. Even if it wasn’t him, Jasmine ultimately wants and loves him. Eventually, she would accept his proposal.</p>
<p>Does she have a better choice better than him? No. Could she choose someone other than him? Is he confident with that?</p>
<p>And according to his instinctive calculation, she had no choice but to take his hand. It looked like the right solution. She had nothing to lose. From the ignorant person’s perspective, it seemed so.</p>
<p>So, it was nothing short of emotional blackmail. He tried to take Jasmine by holding her love hostage and oppressing her.</p>
<p>How did she feel? Jasmine wasn’t just infatuated. She wasn’t foolish.  Wouldn’t she have felt degraded, ashamed, and betrayed? Richard’s chest and face tingled at the same time. To say he was despicable—it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“Even if I had ten mouths, I wouldn’t have anything to say.”</p>
<p>“But you’re speaking now.”</p>
<p>Maybe reminiscing the previous emotions, Jasmine’s expressionless eyes reddened. This time, it wasn’t tears. It was pure frustration. She sneered.</p>
<p>“Now, I’m sure. How ridiculous I must have looked to you,” her voice almost choked.</p>
<p>“No, absolutely not. This is just my ugly and immoral behavior. Please don’t lower yourself.”</p>
<p>“But what do I do? Just being with you makes me feel more and more insignificant.”</p>
<p>Seeing Richard’s expression openly displayed, Jasmine felt slightly satisfied. At the same time, she also felt pain from his expression, as if her heart had been trampled on.</p>
<p>It was irritating. She was sick of it.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop now. It’s hard to keep seeing your face.”</p>
<p>She passed by, ignoring him. But her wrist was caught. And the moment she felt the restraint, fire erupted from within. Jasmine rejected his grip, yelling. Richard’s grip gave way due to the violent reaction.</p>
<p>“Listen here. If you dare touch me again, I will really kill you.”</p>
