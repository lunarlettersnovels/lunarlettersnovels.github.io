            <h3>Chapter 66.2</h3>
<p>The annex of the Grand Duchy quickly filled with fluffy bedding stuffed with goose feathers, silk pajamas, nightgowns, pastel-toned cushions, fluffy dolls, sweet desserts, and late-night snacks.</p>
<p>Jasmine and her friends were thrilled at the thought of playing like they did during their girlhood. They were especially excited because it was the first time in years that the original members were gathering.</p>
<p>Jasmine thought, ‘Indeed, family and friends are the best.’ They like her purely without expecting anything in return and wish for her happiness. She should treat them better, be grateful, and stay true to herself.</p>
<p>She should stop playing foolish dating games. Looking back, these past few months seem to have been full of nonsensical, exhausting activities. Jasmine reflected seriously on herself.</p>
<p>“Jasmine!”</p>
<p>“How long has it been!”</p>
<p>“We just saw each other a little while ago.”</p>
<p>“Still! If it feels like a long time! It is a long time!”</p>
<p>“Kyaaa!”</p>
<p>Watching her friends loudly hug each other and squeal like a flock of noisy birds at a zoo, Lichang exhaled smoke from her pipe indifferently.</p>
<p>Julia, who joined the gathering after a long time, playfully slapped Lichang on the back, telling her to quit smoking. Lichang responded half-heartedly with “Ouch, ouch,” and Jasmine, finding the scene amusing, exchanged a laugh with Marianne.</p>
<p>“Yes, Marianne! It’s been too long. How have you been? You haven’t been in touch!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’ve been quite busy.”</p>
<p>“Busy? Busier than Jasmine? Have you heard about her recent escapades? It’s like she’s got a second wind…!”</p>
<p>“Stop it, stop it. I’m quitting that nonsense today.”</p>
<p>When Jasmine firmly declared this, everyone who had heard snippets about her recent love life widened their eyes in surprise and then cheered.</p>
<p>“Good job. We were worried since you seemed so unlike yourself lately.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we were concerned you’d attract some real trash.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not like it was all bad, right? It’s not like she was cheating.”</p>
<p>As Nikki and Aisha chimed in, the cool-headed knight Julia cleaned her ears and spoke up. Lichang shook her head.</p>
<p>“Why waste time on something insubstantial? It didn’t even seem like she enjoyed it.”</p>
<p>“Why? I’m jealous. She can do that because she has the ability.”</p>
<p>“Jasmine, you can play around like that because it’s before marriage. Just enjoy it.”</p>
<p>“Coming from someone who’s lived in a constant mess with her husband, that’s rich.”</p>
<p>At Marianne’s advice, Aisha retorted incredulously.</p>
<p>“True. Honestly, the real winner here is Marianne.”</p>
<p>“I’m most jealous of her. Her married life is like a romance.”</p>
<p>“Is that a compliment?”</p>
<p>“How did you know? Do you know how many times she stayed over at my house because of fights with her husband? Next time, go to Jasmine’s home!”</p>
<p>When Aisha shouted, Marianne pretended not to hear. Jasmine just laughed, enjoying the lively atmosphere. She clapped her hands to get their attention.</p>
<p>“Let’s eat first! I’m hungry.”</p>
<p>After that, they chatted endlessly while enjoying the dishes the grand duchy’s chef had meticulously prepared: smoked duck salad, meat pie, cucumber sandwiches, gelato, and various desserts.</p>
<p>Then, they snacked on cookies while playing board games, and as usual, Jasmine lost repeatedly at card games. Nikki was amazed.</p>
<p>“Seriously, there’s no other noble as bad at this as you.”</p>
<p>“Be quiet.”</p>
<p>Jasmine grumbled, pouting as she fiddled with the tokens she had lost. She suddenly remembered someone who used to sit next to her, calmly suggesting moves and giving advice. Those deep, blue eyes, the long elegant eyelashes, the straight nose, and the white fingers resting on his chin.</p>
<p>She had thought even his way of pondering was so refined and had sneaked glances at him, only to quickly look away when their eyes met. She would steal a glance again and meet his gaze, still fixed on her, and he would smile faintly.</p>
<p>It was a subtle smile, but given his usually calm demeanor, the change was noticeable. Jasmine tried to ignore it, but her heart trembled slightly.</p>
<p>Why is he smiling and making my heart flutter for no reason?</p>
<p>Seeing Jasmine’s expression turn subtle, Marianne, sitting next to her, defended her.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Even if you’re not good at this, you’re still the richest among us.”</p>
<p>“Hey, isn’t Lichang’s personal income the highest? Or isn’t it Nikki with her new product being a big hit?”</p>
<p>“No matter how well you work, investing well is the best. I’ve never seen anyone manage money as well as Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>“Painful but true.”</p>
<p>While her friends nodded in agreement, Jasmine pondered for a moment.</p>
<p>Should I mention meeting Richard today? I don’t know how they’ll react. Since the last incident, they’ve all been against him, so they might just scold me. While she was lost in thought, her friends continued their conversation.</p>
<p>“So, who are you all seeing these days?”</p>
<p>“I’m seeing Gillian Morphe.”</p>
<p>“Marquis of Morphe? Wow, how did that happen?”</p>
<p>“I was painting his portrait. Well, it’s going well.”</p>
<p>“How romantic. Sigh, what about me.”</p>
<p>“Why, who is it?”</p>
<p>“It’s not really dating… um…”</p>
<p>Julia groaned softly. It was unusual for her, who was always straightforward, to hesitate, making everyone more curious.</p>
