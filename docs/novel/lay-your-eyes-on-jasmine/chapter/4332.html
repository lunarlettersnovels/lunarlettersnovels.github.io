            <p><strong>Chapter 14.1</strong></p>
<p>Upon arriving at Charles’s estate, things went as smoothly as usual. The place was, as he had described, a charming town with beautiful scenery, so it wasn’t too bad.</p>
<p>The famous villa purchased by the Viscount for his beloved daughter and beloved wife looked impressive even to Jasmine, who had been there several times. In fact, it was famous as a tourist destination.</p>
<p>The well-kept garden, courteous staff, and unique local dishes were impressive. Perhaps this was one of Jasmine’s happier moments during her date with Charles.</p>
<p>So when Charles’s friends unexpectedly showed up at his estate and hunting grounds, Jasmine could welcome them without fuss. Sure, they were all men, but they weren’t family, and spending all her time with Charles might get boring.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they brought news that the neighboring villa, essentially part of the royal estate, had Prince Jilian and a group of nobles arrive for a summer hunt.</p>
<p>“Rumors are circulating at the palace. When His Highness goes on a sudden trip, his entourage and their activities tend to be quite flashy,” they reported.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that His Highness, the Crown Prince? He is famous for his impeccable judgement.”</p>
<p>So, they had come down here, under the guise of visiting their friend’s estate, to catch the Crown Prince’s attention.</p>
<p>He held the next in line for the throne in terms of power, and on top of that, Jilian was known for his sarcastic and reserved demeanor, making him an enigmatic figure. Yet, he was also hailed as the country’s most beautiful man. He bore a striking resemblance to the late Empress, renowned for her beauty during her time, so people find it odd that he had a bad relationship with the emperor.</p>
<p>Unofficially, Jasmine herself was often compared to the two most beautiful people of their era, Jasmine and Jilian. Well, well.</p>
<p>But they said that His Highness Jilian has a fiancé. Although her social status is low, he dies to love her so much so that he even fought against Emperor’s rejection and engaged.</p>
<p>Jasmine looked at the men chattering about the Crown Prince’s unexpected visit with a slightly annoyed expression. While it might be mostly driven by curiosity and a gesture of respect towards the future ruler, Jasmine, with her years of experience in high society, could sense that they were simply going along with the flow.</p>
<p>Hovering around someone with power, regardless of gender, wasn’t particularly appealing. It was akin to poking an unripe fruit, and if it involved trying to get something out of it, it was even less appealing.</p>
<p>If it was about ambition for power, there were plenty of ways to make a mark: contributing to the country’s strength, building up one’s family, honing personal talents to gain the favor of rulers. Just like Jasmine’s brothers, who excelled in their respective fields regardless of their family background.</p>
<p>However, most of the acquaintances Charles introduced were either fellow heirs like him or those who had stepped back from the family competition. First of all, they were still quite young.</p>
<p>But shouldn’t that be all the more reason to strive harder?</p>
<p>They might be born with silver spoons, but… well, seeing these capable men made Jasmine feel strangely inadequate, unlike the way she took their abilities for granted when looking at her brothers.</p>
<p>Age was just an excuse, really. James had served as a deputy minister of diplomacy at a young age, and Caras graduated at the top of his class from military school and was at the forefront of pirate suppression.</p>
<p>And then there was Richard, who had commanded the army on the battlefield with guns and swords at an even younger age than them. See, age was just an excuse…</p>
<p>Oh, it reminded her of <em>someone </em>again.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s mood soured further. In any case, she didn’t find it appealing to hover around influential women and powerful figures without any intention of working.</p>
<p>Perhaps His Highness Jilian didn’t choose someone of lower status; they probably wouldn’t have the guts to come all the way here.</p>
<p><em>I guess it’s just the way it is. Why does Charles befriend such people? Well… I probably shouldn’t dwell on other people’s relationships.</em></p>
<p>As Jasmine engaged in conversation with them, smiling and making small talk, she counted down the time until she could leave. Staying with them any longer seemed like it would just become bothersome.</p>
<p>“I think I’d like to take a walk,” she said, rising from her seat.</p>
<p>Charles quickly stood up. “I’ll escort you!”</p>
<p>“No, please. Chat with your friends. I want to walk alone.”</p>
<p>With a smile, Jasmine spoke firmly before turning away. She could feel their eyes on her back. She sighed softly, contemplating.</p>
<p>She had this meeting with the intention of exploring her feelings, feeling a mix of frustration and a desire to experience love with Richard. But increasingly, she felt like she had made a futile effort. After all, she didn’t engage in something unless it was truly heartfelt. While others casually met and parted ways, Jasmine wasn’t that kind of person.</p>
<p>How could she keep spending time when her heart wasn’t in it? Or maybe her heart was just that hard to please.</p>
<p>She let out a faint sigh. Richard was like that too. He was sometimes so serious.</p>
<p><em>That’s right. I maybe this similarity between us was what took me so long to stop chasing him…</em></p>
<p>But no matter how she looked at it, she couldn’t find anyone better than that man.</p>
<p>Moreover, he possessed a sense of responsibility, diligently honed his talents, approached everything earnestly and honestly, and was free of pretentiousness. He may have been teased for being a rascal in the past, but since becoming an adult, Jasmine knew that he hadn’t stepped out of line once. Besides, he was incredibly handsome. Strong, with large hands…</p>
<p>Unlucky, perhaps, but someone who shone and drew attention so effortlessly… Could there be another like him? What if there isn’t? Jasmine felt disheartened.</p>
