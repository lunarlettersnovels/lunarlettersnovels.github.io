            <p><strong>Chapter 107.2</strong></p>
<p>How fortunate that she had liked someone quite admirable after all. What a relief. How empty and meaningless it would have been if the person she had longed for so lonely turned out to be worthless.</p>
<p>Of course, these were the reasons she liked him. The more she saw him, the more he shone and impressed her. The person himself sparkled.</p>
<p>Jasmine exhaled a long breath, as if surrendering.</p>
<p>“Yes. I understand.”</p>
<p>His handsome eyes lighting up at her words, the refreshing smile on his lips, and the dimple on one cheek were all so pleasant to see. Jasmine slightly squinted her eyes as if facing the morning sun directly.</p>
<p>“Then, will you spare some time for me today? Since I was punished yesterday, I think it’s only fair that I receive a reward today to balance things out.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never given you a reward or punishment before.”</p>
<p>“Well, in that case, let’s start with the reward today, and I’ll receive the punishment later.”</p>
<p>“You’re being very presumptuous.”</p>
<p>It seems like she’s becoming more and more brazen. Jasmine let out a sigh and crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“But aren’t you supposed to go to work? Why did the head of the military come here instead of going to the palace? The three men in my household have already gone to work.”</p>
<p>“Because I have many capable officers.”</p>
<p>Richard changed the subject, avoiding any mention of taking a leave of absence.</p>
<p>“There’s one thing I need to confirm.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“About meeting other men – were you serious?”</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>“I’m asking because I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Think about it carefully, then.”</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see how it goes.”</p>
<p>Jasmine let out a snicker, finding it somewhat amusing. Hadn’t he said he didn’t mind? Then what was all that talk yesterday about?</p>
<p>Sure enough, before long, Jasmine would discover whether Duke Aion’s bold promise had been genuine or false. Though it wasn’t her intention.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A beautiful aria resonated throughout the opera house. The first act ended with the prima donna’s final cry. As the velvet curtain fell and the stage darkened, Jasmine covered her mouth with the tip of her fan and turned to Richard, whispering.</p>
<p>“I heard they changed the actress for Ariadne’s role, and she’s much better, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She’s much more skilled at emotional expression and her high notes are more precise. Juette was certainly a great actress too, but after her injury, there were some regrettable aspects.”</p>
<p>Richard, who had been completely immersed, immediately agreed. They spent quite a while discussing the changed composition of the first part and the still excellent staging and direction. Richard and Jasmine had come to see “Ariane,” the most popular classical opera in the empire.</p>
<p>Its distinctive tragic nature, powerful arias that struck a chord with imperial tastes, and the touching, beautiful love story made it a timeless piece that resonated across generations.</p>
<p>Naturally, Richard and Jasmine, who had memories of watching this opera from the VIP seats since childhood, enjoyed comparing the former prima donna, now a memory of the past, with the present performer. Since they shared similar interests and cultural experiences, once they started talking, their conversations seemed endless.</p>
<p>It was also quite interesting to discover how their appreciations were subtly different while being similar.</p>
<p>“Oh dear. The intermission is already over.”</p>
<p>As the curtain rose again before he could even visit the restroom, Richard wore a dismayed expression. They had lost track of time, absorbed in conversation. Jasmine giggled softly as she gathered her handbag and stood up.</p>
<p>“Since we already know the story anyway. Please keep watching. I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>“I’ll escort you.”</p>
<p>“You’re joking, right? It’s just right there.”</p>
<p>When Jasmine looked at him incredulously, Richard shrugged as if confirming it was indeed a joke. She smiled and shook her head as she walked out. Coming from the darkness into the light, her eyes were momentarily dazzled.</p>
<p>The unique atmosphere of the theater made Jasmine feel refreshed anew, and she realized it had been a while since she’d had such a clear change of mood.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, she and Richard shared many hobbies, making it comfortable and enjoyable to pursue these leisure activities together. It was a different kind of pleasure compared to being with friends.</p>
<p>Yes, she was surprised at how well they matched, unexpectedly. Of course, it might not be so strange considering that during her girlhood days when she followed him around, she had adopted many of his interests, preferences, and hobbies in an attempt to understand them, until they eventually became her own tastes.</p>
<p>It was probably similar to discovering oneself becoming naturally similar to an idol after admiring them. Jasmine gazed at her reflection in the powder room mirror. She saw a sophisticated blonde woman in a blue dress wearing light makeup.</p>
<p>This was an appearance she couldn’t have imagined in her immature youth. Back then, she had no interest in or desire to pursue things like becoming skilled in social interactions, taking care of her appearance, or cultivating refinement.</p>
<p>She was somewhat like an untamed foal back then. While that wasn’t necessarily bad, Jasmine liked who she was now, having unexpectedly discovered many things she enjoyed and was good at.</p>
<p>After reapplying her lipstick and touching up her makeup, she was walking back to enter the theater when someone stopped her.</p>
<p>“Jasmine?”</p>
