            <p><strong>Chapter 80.1</strong></p>
<p>“But exactly where does it hurt?”</p>
<p>Richard’s concise question made Jasmine’s eyes sparkle. Surely, Soyer wouldn’t ignore a superior’s question. Under her gaze, Soyer paused before replying briefly.</p>
<p>“It’s just a common cold.”</p>
<p>“Strange. You didn’t even catch a cold on the Northern Front?”</p>
<p>Richard murmured in surprise, crossing his arms. Jasmine tilted her head, puzzled too. According to Marian, Soyer was as sturdy as steel, rarely even coughing except for some sensitive skin. Stress is indeed the root of all illnesses.</p>
<p><em>“Well, at least that’s a relief. Even is he’s in dangerous places, it brings some comfort.”</em></p>
<p>Jasmine struggled to hold back a laugh at Marian’s mumbling that came to mind.</p>
<p>“Sir Soyer, you do want to reconcile with Marian, right?”</p>
<p>Soyer’s eyes met Jasmine’s determined purple ones, and a wry smile crossed his face.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Good. Then please answer honestly; we have a witness here.”</p>
<p>Jasmine firmly pointed her thumb at Richard. Caught off guard, the Duke of Ion blinked but nodded. After all, he wasn’t in a position to refuse Jasmine’s request. Just being with her made his heart race, so agreeing was a given.</p>
<p>Jasmine asked bluntly.</p>
<p>“Have you been cheating?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Soyer replied irritably. Jasmine nodded.</p>
<p>“Alright. Then why did you lie?”</p>
<p>“Lie about what?”</p>
<p>“Saying you were working late when you weren’t, coming home late suddenly, acting out of character, and avoiding Marian. You’ve been arguing more and talking less.”</p>
<p>There were other suspicious things, but she couldn’t bring herself to say them out loud. Richard, finding it odd too, tilted his head. Under their scrutinizing stares, Soyer sighed and responded.</p>
<p>“I just didn’t want to worry Marian. It was nothing serious.”</p>
<p>“Then what was the cause?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Do you not want to answer?”</p>
<p>Silent again. How frustrating. No wonder Marian exploded. A stubborn person like this can drive anyone crazy. Jasmine clicked her tongue as she glanced at another similarly stubborn man.</p>
<p>“Is it perhaps boredom or something?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Boredom?”</p>
<p>Richard, who had been listening intently, muttered softly. Jasmine explained briefly.</p>
<p>“When your partner, whom you’ve been perfectly fine with, suddenly becomes intolerable. You don’t want to see them, be around them, or share a bed. You just want to be alone. It’s common in long-term relationships. But honestly, don’t the symptoms sound too similar?”</p>
<p>Richard tilted his head, more confused.</p>
<p>“Why does that happen?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. But from what I hear, being together all the time makes you forget their value and become too familiar. Simply put, you get bored.”</p>
<p>“Even if the other person hasn’t done anything wrong?”</p>
<p>“So they say.”</p>
<p>Jasmine responded indifferently, and Richard looked puzzled. He imagined not breaking up with Jasmine half a year ago, staying together, or even successfully marrying her and spending every day together for 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p>A smile naturally spread on Richard’s face, but conscious of the person next to him, he forced his lips back down and pondered seriously. No relationship is always sunny.</p>
<p>People naturally age, so he would grow old, and so would Jasmine. Of course, she would become an elegant lady like her mother, but middle-aged or elderly, each age has its charm and allure. And he wouldn’t always be a perfect man.</p>
<p>As Jasmine had reminded him, he wasn’t perfect, and there would be times when she found him annoying or unattractive. She might think he was not as good as before.</p>
<p>However, growing old together naturally, he couldn’t imagine suddenly getting tired of his spouse and treating her coldly and cruelly. How could anyone do that? Besides, it’s his wife.</p>
<p>Just the fact that his spouse remained faithful to him was precious and something to be grateful for. How could anyone treat such loyalty so carelessly? He couldn’t understand the concept. It felt like self-torment.</p>
<p>While he was lost in thought, Jasmine’s interrogation continued.</p>
<p>“Sir Soyer, or rather, brother-in-law. I’ve seen you with Marian for a long time, so I honestly didn’t think that way. But suspicions pile up one by one until they become the truth. Actually, what’s most important right now might not be whether you’re cheating or not.”</p>
<p>The gazes of the two men, each deep in thought, turned to her. Jasmine crossed her arms and spoke sternly.</p>
<p>“It’s about the lies. The lack of honesty. Among other things…”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s eyes grew cold.</p>
<p>“Women can’t forgive deceit or lies.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“I know Sir Soyer isn’t an excellent liar. But sometimes, not telling the truth, avoiding it, or not sharing information the other person should know is also deceit. That itself breaks trust and excludes the other person from your life. You’re supposed to be partners, so why aren’t you in this together?”</p>
<p>She bit her lip as if she herself was upset and hurt.</p>
<p>“Do you know how betrayed, ignored, and hurt that feels?”</p>
