            <h3>Chapter 92.2</h3>
<p>As Jasmine busied herself looking around, Richard, who had been silent, spoke.</p>
<p>“Do you like it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s beautiful.”</p>
<p>Jasmine had visited grand palaces, sleek mansions reflecting the tastes of the most popular contemporary artists, and opulent homes showcasing the pinnacle of luxury, but somehow, she liked this place the most.</p>
<p>It was fascinating how it matched the man in front of her so perfectly. She suddenly remembered how he had been intrigued by her childhood portrait when he visited the Grand Duke’s residence. Jasmine’s eyes rolled around.</p>
<p>“Why aren’t there any family portraits?”</p>
<p>Usually, when visiting a noble family’s mansion, one would see busts of ancestors or the head of the family and portraits of the family members. But the Duke’s mansion was excessively tidy. Richard shrugged.</p>
<p>“Just because it feels embarrassing. We can take them out when needed, but why hang them where everyone can see?”</p>
<p>“No, you hang them because you need them? It’s your home, so you hang family pictures.”</p>
<p>Jasmine found it peculiar and was taken aback. He was fine with doing embarrassing things but felt awkward about something so mundane. Richard paused for a moment before speaking.</p>
<p>“My sister is living well, so there’s no need to hang her portrait. I don’t particularly want to see my own face. As for my parents, it didn’t sit well with me, so I put them away.”</p>
<p>“There must have been a reason it didn’t sit well.”</p>
<p>“I was young when I inherited the title. Occasionally, when I returned to the capital and saw my mother and father’s smiling faces, I felt like my resolve weakened. It was a time when I couldn’t afford to be weak. So, I had them put away. Now, I think it might be okay.”</p>
<p>Richard spoke calmly, reflecting on the past as it was all behind him now. Although he hadn’t realized it at the time, looking back, he saw that the barely twenty-year-old Richard sometimes found the burden overwhelming.</p>
<p>Even though his parents were bedridden and rarely seen, their absence brought an unimaginable sense of loneliness and isolation. That emptiness felt even stronger when he was alone in his office.</p>
<p>Knowing that this was the beginning of something he would have to repeat until he died, he had no clear answers. So, he immersed himself in work even more frantically. He knew all too well that he had to endure, succeed, and eventually, he would manage it.</p>
<p>But the process was never easy. Yes, looking back, it was like that. Richard glanced at the silent Jasmine and gave an embarrassed smile.</p>
<p>“But funnily enough, I didn’t even know why I was doing it at the time. It’s quite amusing, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“What’s funny about hard work? It’s just hard.”</p>
<p>Jasmine said firmly.</p>
<p>“When you’re too overwhelmed, you don’t even realize you’re struggling or in pain. You’re too busy to take care of yourself. It’s natural for anyone.”</p>
<p>She raised her hand and lightly tapped his arm before withdrawing it. Like a friend, or like a cat gently placing its paw on someone it trusts, she touched him softly and then moved away.</p>
<p>“You’ve done well. You’ve endured it magnificently.”</p>
<p>Richard felt a heightened sensation, as if he had swallowed hot water in one gulp. He couldn’t find any words to say.</p>
<p>In truth, those who cared for him—the Emperor, who was like his father, his cousin who was his lord, his only sibling, his sister, and many excellent retainers and colleagues—each helped and comforted him in their own ways, but no one had ever said such words to him.</p>
<p>Being someone who was always perfect and self-sufficient was just like that. Doing well was always taken for granted, and while it was admired and acknowledged, no one ever wondered or cared about how difficult, lonely, and sometimes painful the process was.</p>
<p>It wasn’t surprising, as even he hadn’t fully understood the frustration and stress he occasionally felt. Richard himself hadn’t completely grasped the feelings of pent-up anger or the stress he sometimes experienced.</p>
<p>So, suddenly and unexpectedly receiving ‘comfort’ and ‘recognition’ that he hadn’t anticipated, Richard didn’t know how to react. His insides felt warm, and that warmth gradually rose to his face, making his eyes and cheeks flush.</p>
<p>His fingertips tingled, so he clenched his fists to keep from reaching out to her impulsively.</p>
<p>He made an effort to change the subject.</p>
<p>“Have you ever met my sister?”</p>
<p>“Um, no. I don’t think so. Isn’t your sister the one famous for being a genius?”</p>
<p>“She is quite smart.”</p>
<p>Richard’s expression was indifferent as he said this.</p>
<p>“It would be nice if she were average in other aspects too.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Jasmine’s curiosity was soon resolved. As soon as Richard opened the door, a chaotic noise erupted. Was there construction going on? Richard, who had stepped back to let the speechless Jasmine move aside, entered without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Risha Aion.”</p>
<p>“Wait! Don’t come in.”</p>
<p>Richard took in the sight of the tangled electrical wires, the flasks scattered around, and his disheveled sister crouched in the corner, frantically scribbling equations. This time, he let out a sigh of exasperation for a different reason. It was true. He was genuinely irritated.</p>
