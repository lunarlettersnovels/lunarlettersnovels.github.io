            <h3>Chapter 70.2</h3>
<p>But Risha felt genuinely wronged. She hadn’t instigated anything, yet she was being scolded (as usual, she didn’t know the reason and wasn’t very interested).</p>
<p>She whined, “I gave you dating advice, and how do you repay it with ingratitude? I only said what was necessary because seeing you pitifully like a heat-stricken dog…”</p>
<p>“Huh? Dating advice?”</p>
<p>Nysa’s eyes twinkled with amusement. Richard instinctively muttered a curse.</p>
<p>“What! What! Why are you the only ones who know what’s funny!”</p>
<p>“Is my suffering amusing to you?”</p>
<p>When Richard asked sarcastically, Nysa solemnly nodded.</p>
<p>“Of course not. It’s out of interest and affection.”</p>
<p>“Get lost. Disappear from this house.”</p>
<p>Nysa jerked her thumb at Richard, who smirked back. He pointed his long index finger at Risha, who was still cupping her bulging forehead.</p>
<p>“Take that with you on the way out.”</p>
<p>“You’re abusing your authority. Haven’t you read Father’s will? It clearly states that my rights are partially included in this mansion.”</p>
<p>“That’ll be until I get married. Get ready to pack soon when I sort out the inheritance properly.”</p>
<p>“What about marriage? Forget about it.”</p>
<p>As Risha muttered quietly, Richard scanned the surroundings with a sharp look. His eyes flashed urgently as if he were really considering hitting her with another cushion. Nysa bit her tongue, amused, and let out a cough.</p>
<p>“What’s with this mood? A member of the imperial family is here, and you’re bragging about your family feud, huh?”</p>
<p>“Nysa.”</p>
<p>“Why.”</p>
<p>“If it’s funny, just laugh. Enough with the nonsense.”</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, Nysa burst into laughter, grinning widely.</p>
<p>“Can you see?”</p>
<p>“See what? Get lost.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. I brought alcohol to unwind after a long time. Please take a look.”</p>
<p>Nysa winked (the two siblings looked at each other simultaneously, wondering why). She pulled out a golden bottle from her embrace. Nysa smirked, noticing the two Aion’s eyes take on a different glow the moment they spotted it.</p>
<p>For someone from the Aion family, there was no one who disliked alcohol. Richard, with his thorough personality, disliked losing control and steered clear of alcohol, but he generally enjoyed it. When she was a student at the Academy, there were many times when she was wronged by a drunk Richard.</p>
<p>“A 24-year-old Galanion stolen from the imperial cellar. You know they only make five bottles a decade, right?”</p>
<p>Nysa slapped Risha’s outstretched hand away and crossed her legs haughtily. It was almost imperial.</p>
<p>“Jil would be furious like a horned cat if he found out, but whatever. It’s so delicious. So, quickly prepare the table…”</p>
<p>“Roasted chicken with garlic and spices, spicy scallops, salmon steak, white bread toasted in olive oil, asparagus sautéed in butter, what else do you need?”</p>
<p>Richard quickly rattled off the menu, torn between pulling the string or calling the butler himself. Nysa blinked and nodded politely.</p>
<p>“That should be enough.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>Richard slumped onto the sofa after dismissing the butler. His face, when he threw off his tie, was no different from the solemn visage of a noble attending a council meeting, leaving the remaining two to stare blankly at him. Nysa scratched her head, dropping the mischief.</p>
<p>“What’s this? I thought you’d lecture me about breaking imperial rules.”</p>
<p>“Rules or whatever, to hell with them.”</p>
<p>Richard snatched the bottle from Nysa’s hand, scoffing as he rudely popped the cork off. Lysa’s eyes widened in surprise as Richard gulped down the entire bottle, ignoring the glass that was gently offered to him. Nysa was also surprised and shouted.</p>
<p>“Hey! Careful, da.mn it!”</p>
<p>“Are you crazy! That’s precious!”</p>
<p>“…Risha, he’s still your brother.”</p>
<p>“There’s only one bottle of that, and he’s drinking it all by himself! Immoral!”</p>
<p>“It’s not immorality. It’s lack of basic manners. Ha, what are we going to do with you?”</p>
<p>Nysa exclaimed in disbelief as she pulled out another bottle from her coat pocket. How those slender pockets contained them all was a mystery.</p>
<p>“I brought two more bottles! You calm down, and you! Stop drinking!”</p>
<p>After draining about half by himself, Richard calmly set the bottle down without a change in his complexion. He was being overly nonchalant, but he was already acting like a drunkard.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t that he was intoxicated—he just wasn’t himself. Nysa was starting to worry.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you? Is this really about a woman?”</p>
<p>Richard licked his lips without a reply. His eyes stared blankly into space. Then, suddenly, a faint smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I feel like a fool myself.”</p>
<p>“Well, even if that’s the case, there’s no need to torment yourself like that. Life happens.”</p>
<p>“Risha, maybe you should keep quiet until the appetizers arrive.”</p>
<p>Nysa quietly admonished Risha, who rambled as she sipped her drink. Risha grumbled that Nysa always favored their brother, but she obediently hushed up. Despite being the youngest, she generally listened to her sisters.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s how the drinking session began. Unexpectedly, starting in a corner of the study, it properly moved to the reception room following Risha’s vehement protests about the smell of food in books.</p>
