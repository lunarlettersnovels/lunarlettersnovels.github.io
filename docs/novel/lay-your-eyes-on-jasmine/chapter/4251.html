            <h3><strong>Chapter 54.2</strong></h3>
<p>“Is that so.”</p>
<p>Jasmine accomplished everything in months others would have taken a year or two to accomplish. It’s quite awe-inspiring. She couldn’t believe that all of this could happen within such a short period and she felt awestruck once again.</p>
<p>Lichang, who was examining her thoughtful face, chuckled softly.</p>
<p>“But why that look?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You still seem somewhat regretful.”</p>
<p>It pricked her heart. As Jasmine blinked blankly, caught off-guard, Lichang gently asked again.</p>
<p>“Do you regret it?”</p>
<p>It was a tender yet cruel question. Indeed, she didn’t spare any tenderness. Jasmine tilted her head slightly, facing Lichang’s deep green eyes head-on. Unlike before, the answer came quickly.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>At her calm and firm response, the corners of Lichang’s lips turned up. As expected.</p>
<p>“But why are you still sad? Well, a week might be a bit short to exhaust all emotions. In your case, if we consider the time from before, it’s quite a long period, but still.”</p>
<p>“… Sometimes, Lichang, you’re too persistent and sharp.”</p>
<p>As Jasmine puffed and pursed her cheeks, Lichang affectionately brushed her friend’s cheek with a giggle.</p>
<p>“Because you seem to have a lot on your mind. It’s better to express everything clearly. If you keep it in your heart and ignore it, it will become difficult to deal with.”</p>
<p>Regret is not a bad thing. Rather, it is natural.</p>
<p>“Even if you still have lingering feelings, don’t blame yourself too much. Do whatever your heart desires. We’re all on your side.”</p>
<p>“Mhm. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Jasmine let out a brief sigh. Well, this, too, shall pass.</p>
<p>Both her parents, brothers, and friends around her had said so, and Jasmine decided to trust in her optimistic memory and brain.</p>
<p>Then, muttering to herself to cheer up, she eagerly began to eat the parfait, and the tarts and cakes that her friends had given her piled up on her plate.</p>
<p>Eat, eat. At times like these, you should eat lots of sweet things, along with encouraging words.</p>
<p>Lastly, Lichang smiled mysteriously as he placed Jasmine’s favorite red strawberries on top of the slightly melted parfait. Her bright red lipstick created a delightfully subtle line on her lips.</p>
<p>“Well, the urgency is on that side, not this side.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jasmine spent a lazy and leisurely afternoon with a full and content stomach. She chatted with friends about everything from social circles to business, the latest trends, investments, and gossip, and indulged in luxurious desserts at the renowned dessert shop in the capital (also owned by Lichang).</p>
<p>Lichang brought a special snack from the Kanda Kingdom and gave it an imperial twist. The blend of soft vanilla aroma and creamy sweetness tantalized the taste buds.</p>
<p>Gazing at the riverboat lazily drifting on the flowing river, Jasmine’s thoughts wandered off.</p>
<p>‘Oh, lately, I’ve been eating too many sweet things.’</p>
<p>Already in her second bowl, the thought occurred as she set down her spoon. Jasmine wondered when she started going crazy over sweets like this, and she regretted it immediately.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because of stress or because she liked sweet things.</p>
<p>It was only after meeting Richard… After se!x, she craved sweet and fatty foods. If she couldn’t eat them, she would get irritated and lethargic.</p>
<p>Richard noticed this and started stocking up on snacks right after. They were diverse and suited her taste. Moreover, since they made love every day, Jasmine had been living on sweet foods throughout her time at the summer villa.</p>
<p>While she was eating excitedly, he would sit beside her, rest his chin on her shoulder, and occasionally plant kisses on her cheek and forehead. Then, he would take her wrist and tenderly press his lips against the back of her hand.</p>
<p>His gentle expression was so lovely and exciting, yet Jasmine, feeling overwhelmed and distracted, couldn’t bear it and told him off.</p>
<p>Richard would always apologize and laugh. Sorry. I just wanted to watch.</p>
<p>“Because you’re so beautiful.”</p>
<p>Then he smiled again, seeing her ears turn red.</p>
<p>Why did he have to be so nice to her?</p>
<p>Even after Jasmine returned home, whenever his memories overwhelmed her, she felt a sharp pain in her chest and struggled to redirect her thoughts.</p>
<p>She kept making plans, constantly meeting with family and friends, to avoid being alone for a moment. Because whenever she was alone or doing nothing, she kept thinking about him.</p>
<p>She acted calmly, cheerfully, and smiled, but she still felt like crying when she lay alone in bed at night. It was inevitable.</p>
<p>She tried so hard to ignore it, even deny it, but in the end, one of her true feelings was this.</p>
<p>‘I miss you.’</p>
<p>Whether she was eating, drinking tea, taking a walk, or even reading a book, she would lift her head and suddenly find him sitting in front of her.</p>
<p>She missed him so much that her heart ached.</p>
