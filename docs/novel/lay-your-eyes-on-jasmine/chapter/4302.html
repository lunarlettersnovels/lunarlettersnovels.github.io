            <p><strong>Chapter 29.1</strong></p>
<p>“I always thought that if I were to welcome a consort, I would choose someone from a family with qualities that could be helpful to me. It would be even better if they were a good political match. As long as they don’t overstep their bounds and create unnecessary trouble, I was willing to turn a blind eye, even if they had other women, as long as they didn’t produce illegitimate children. Well, I’d enjoy myself, too.”</p>
<p>Jilian, who took his stern gaze off the bright blue sky, curled his lips slightly while glancing at his cousin. Richard couldn’t dare to guess what was on his mind.</p>
<p>“Who knew I would end up like this?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Prince Jilian’s love story was famous. People were surprised that the prince, who dated many men, fell in love only with one person.</p>
<p>Even the Emperor and Empress, who had long been urging him to get married, were surprised, and his sister Nysa couldn’t help but laugh and ask if he had gone crazy. Richard didn’t show it, but he was also quite surprised.</p>
<p>For a man who had never shown any interest in power or people, getting involved with another man, and one from a not particularly prestigious family, was already astounding.</p>
<p>Jonathan was an ordinary, modest man who had no ambition. In Richard’s view, Jonathan was a good man. He was kind, understood Jilian’s quirks, and loved him sincerely. He also brought some emotional stability to Jilian.</p>
<p>If Jilian weren’t the imperial heir but an ordinary noble, it wouldn’t have been a particularly difficult engagement, except that Jonathan was overly modest and too good.</p>
<p>Not only were they different in terms of power, but Jonathan was a person who didn’t fit in with the upper echelons of society. Julian would reign the country, and no rival could compete with Jilian.</p>
<p>It was an impossible love story.</p>
<p>Of course, as typical of the imperial family, Jilian was not one to give up on something she had set her mind to.</p>
<p>“I’ve got my options, but it’s still insufficient. You know that.”</p>
<p>“If His HIghness wants him, who would dare rebel against you?”</p>
<p>“Well, of course. However, should they do the same to my heir, who has the blood of a lower noble mixed in?”</p>
<p>Richard’s expression stiffened.</p>
<p>“It is almost as serious as committing treason to discuss the blood of the royal heirs. Some people… should be silenced right away.”</p>
<p>“Come on. I’m not talking about it right now. I wouldn’t worry about this if Nysa’s partner were different.”</p>
<p>Although it was a joking complaint, it was dry and sarcastic. Richard fell silent. Nysa, the princess, had previously declared that she had no intention of ascending to the throne. She was popular among the knights for her modesty, and some even followed her.</p>
<p>However, the fiancé she had chosen was none other than Lord Jade, the son of the Kanda royal family, a prestigious and noble lineage, and he had a pedigree that was not too shabby.</p>
<p>It was an inevitable comparison. There would be no problem during Jilian’s reign, but if it passed on to the next generation, Jilian’s successor might not be as qualified. This was because, in this strict society based on bloodline, Jilian’s position would weaken if even a hint of his successor’s inadequacy appeared.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in succession at all. Before, I thought passing it on to Nysa’s child wouldn’t be bad. It would have been convenient in many ways. But the person I’m concerned about is him.”</p>
<p>It was an unfamiliar sensation—a vulnerable and human side of Jilian. What made it even more remarkable was his intense sincerity.</p>
<p>Love changes people, even those who seem unlikely to be affected. Is this what love is?</p>
<p>It’s not just about getting what you want but also worrying about that person’s distant future and any potential hurt and feeling a deep and tender affection…</p>
<p>If that were the case, it’s slightly different from Richard’s first love. He didn’t have many feelings of this kind, but he…</p>
<p>He couldn’t understand why a fair face with golden hair spread out on a soft, white pillow suddenly came to mind.</p>
<p>“That’s why Liovanni is important.”</p>
<p>It felt like he had been splashed with cold water.</p>
<p>“The Kingdom of Kanda will continue to be an important hub for trade. It will only become more important as time goes on. “His Majesty will bestow Jade Kanda a separate title.”</p>
<p>“That’s unusual.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. Isn’t it more convenient for me to keep multiple options open?”</p>
<p>Richard remained silent at the Prince’s meaningful gaze. He understood the intentions of Prince Jilian and his position, but it was not easy to give a straightforward answer.</p>
<p>He wasn’t precisely hesitant; instead, he was leaning towards the opposite. In many ways, it wasn’t a bad thing. There were numerous advantages. However, for some reason, Richard felt reluctant and uncomfortable discussing <em>her</em> in this conversation.</p>
<p>It was an unfamiliar emotion even for someone born and raised in high nobility.</p>
