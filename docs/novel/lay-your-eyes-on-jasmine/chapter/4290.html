            <p><strong>Chapter 35.1</strong></p>
<p>“You tried your best in your way, and I didn’t understand it. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>But perhaps it wasn’t just that. Maybe his selfish desire to claim her as his own, to boldly show her off, was even stronger.</p>
<p>He only truly realized this when he kissed the back of Jasmine’s hand.</p>
<p>However, he was dumbfounded when Jasmine gently scratched away any traces of his desire for recognition and disappointment that he might have had inside him. She hit it perfectly. Richard hugged her and covered her mouth.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Jasmine couldn’t see it, but his face had turned beet red.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Richard found himself in a state of genuine confusion, biting his lips. His throat felt dry.</p>
<p>The turmoil intermittently gnawing at his heart and mind turned into a giant wave that washed over him.</p>
<p>His heart raced madly. At this very moment, he felt two conflicting desires.</p>
<p>He wanted to kiss this woman’s face with his hands tightly gripping her, and at the same time, he wanted to remain forever in this warm embrace without breaking the enchantment.</p>
<p>Both were so tempting that it was agonizing to pick one.</p>
<p>And then, when she uttered a word mixed with a sigh and a hint of laughter, the most endearing word in the world, it pierced his ears, and Richard finally knelt like a defeated beast.</p>
<p>“I think I like you a lot.”</p>
<p>As if his vision was fading, Richard buried his face in her shoulder. The veins of his hand on the back of her warm, golden hair bulged. A low, suppressed voice flowed out.</p>
<p>“I feel the same way.”</p>
<p>Jasmine brushed his black hair lightly as she laughed, not knowing what was going on in his mind.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, the thought crossed his mind that this man’s hair was soft as silk, leaving her baffled.</p>
<p>Still, with each passing exchange, as they shared their feelings, they were gradually getting better. After all, they had plenty of time.</p>
<p>Sigh. Love is undeniably difficult…</p>
<p>But one thing is certain: she was much happier now than when it was only her unrequited love.</p>
<p>Even if it’s imperfect, take it slow.</p>
<p>That should be enough.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Oh! Richard, hold on… Slowly!”</p>
<p>“Haah, haah…”</p>
<p>He couldn’t possibly go slow.</p>
<p>As soon as they entered the enclosed space, Richard’s kiss rushed upon her, leaving Jasmine bewildered, as if something had snapped inside him.</p>
<p>While they had done this before, it felt different, more sudden this time.</p>
<p>With embarrassment, she allowed his lips to passionately draw her in, and after several moments of giving in to his fiery kisses, she gasped and whispered desperately.</p>
<p>Kissing her, Richard seemed frustrated that he couldn’t touch her entirely. He relentlessly caressed her, locked lips, and traced her skin. As a result, their attire was already disheveled.</p>
<p>“This is the stables… What if someone comes?”</p>
<p>“The western stables are reserved for the Royal Family. No one will come.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no… That means we shouldn’t be here either!”</p>
<p>She scolded him, pulling his wrist as it sneaked its way under her shirt and caressed her back. Richard gently bit the tip of Jasmine’s nose, finding her shocked expression adorable.</p>
<p>“His Majesty won’t say a word.”</p>
<p>“Oh, goodness.”</p>
<p>“Focus on me.”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>She didn’t know when he started unbuttoning my shirt, but the next moment her shirt came off and became loose.</p>
<p>He hugged her, biting her defenseless nape, leaving a mark on her, and without hesitation, pulled her underwear down. When her plump bre@sts came into view, he eagerly massaged them.</p>
<p>Jasmine’s ar0usal rose quickly. She m0aned, he sucked and whispered to her reddened ear.</p>
<p>“I was a bit rushed.”</p>
<p>His snake-like hand delved into her stomach and down to her lower region. He pressed his fingers at the top of her pan!ties, feeling her wetness. He smiled, and he pulled out his fingers to show it to Jasmine. She was wet.</p>
<p>Blushing with embarrassment, Jasmine slapped his cheek playfully. Richard laughed heartily and kissed her blushing face all over.</p>
<p>“You’re so beautiful, and why are you so cute and lovely?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, come on.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t flatly reject him, which was irritating. If he really meant it, he should say so. That left Jasmine speechless, feeling awkward and embarrassed. She whimpered in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty by nature! Really!”</p>
<p>Her defiantly acknowledging her beauty with a flushed face was amusing and utterly endearing. Richard held her tightly, chuckling.</p>
<p>Indeed, he understood it now. Whatever this emotion was, he wasn’t sure, but he was confident that it surpassed any attachment or desire he had ever felt.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he wouldn’t feel this passionately, as if his heart would burst…</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“Haah… Jasmine, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>I like you.</p>
<p>I want to do this with you every day.</p>
<p>Richard watched her lowered eyes, her whimpering expression as he circled the tip of her breasts, and he put his finger into her mouth and told her to suck it clean.</p>
<p>His smooth, slick hands passed over her soft thighs, where her riding clothes were half-down, and rubbed her plump petals.</p>
