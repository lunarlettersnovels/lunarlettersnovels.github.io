            <h3>Chapter 98.1</h3>
<p>Jasmine was surprised. If it had been any other ex, she would have refused outright, but Charles was different. As she hesitated, Charles gave her a gentle smile. He didn’t seem to have any expectations either.</p>
<p>“I have something to tell you. If it makes you uncomfortable, you can refuse.”</p>
<p>His courteous demeanor, free of any disappointment, changed her mind. In truth, she felt it would be a shame to part ways so abruptly. From beginning to end, Charles had been more of a blessing, always gentlemanly and considerate.</p>
<p>Moreover, although he might not know it, Charles had a significant emotional impact on Jasmine. Deciding that she would pay for the tea, even though Charles had suggested the meeting, Jasmine nodded.</p>
<p>So, they sat at a nearby outdoor café. She hadn’t expected to see him again like this. Perhaps it was because Charles seemed more at ease than before, despite a hint of nervousness. Jasmine gave him the most relaxed smile she had ever shared during their time together.</p>
<p>“Are you doing well?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It seems you have been well too, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Charles smiled. With his hair cut shorter and looking more polished, he seemed much more refined than he had half a year ago. He appeared calmer and his gaze had deepened. Jasmine observed him carefully and then smiled.</p>
<p>“You look much more handsome. You look good.”</p>
<p>“Not at all.”</p>
<p>He blushed, seemingly embarrassed. Seeing him like this reminded her of the young man who had tried so hard to impress her. The memories of those times had now become gentle recollections. Jasmine felt a pleasant sense of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Charles, who had been watching her intently, spoke up.</p>
<p>“You seem very different too, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Really? How so?</p>
<p>He watched her, a soft smile on her face, and laughed shyly.</p>
<p>“You’re still beautiful, but there’s a different air about you. I mean that in a good way.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for catching you off guard like this. Please don’t misunderstand. It’s not that I want to impose any burden, it’s just…”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I agreed to it, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>Jasmine spoke as she watched him fidgeting with his fingers.</p>
<p>“Actually, I was glad to see Charles after such a long time. It brought back memories. In some ways, those were good times.”</p>
<p>Back then, she didn’t realize it. She was more innocent and brave, her heart racing with more vibrant emotions, and she thought that was everything. She saw the bright side before the pain, fear, or anxiety. She missed that purity a little and even envied it. Jasmine lowered her head and smiled.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. It’s tactless of me to say this when I essentially turned you down.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>Charles waved his hand dismissively. In moments like this, he seemed unchanged. Jasmine felt a slight regret that they hadn’t remained friends.</p>
<p>“How have you been, Charles?”</p>
<p>“Well, nothing much happened. If I were to mention something significant, it would be that I distanced myself from those friends.”</p>
<p>Those friends… Jasmine’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>Did you cut ties with them?”</p>
<p>“In a way, yes.”</p>
<p>Charles affirmed briefly, as if it didn’t bother him at all. Jasmine’s surprise mixed with amusement grew, and she chuckled.</p>
<p>“I guess I broke up your friendships.”</p>
<p>“No, it would have happened eventually. They were not good influences behind the scenes. Even though I knew it, I was indecisive and followed them because I had known them since childhood. For that, I am very grateful to you, Jasmine. If it weren’t for what you said back then, I might have been awkwardly entangled and influenced by them. I… the old me didn’t have a proper sense of self. Looking back, I realize that.”</p>
<p>Charles scratched his short hair. Jasmine looked at him warmly.</p>
<p>“I never really thought deeply about what I liked or disliked, how to assert myself, or what I should live for. I just grew up as a good son who listened to his parents. Everyone around me said that was the way to live well. Other people’s views, thoughts, and opinions became my own. So, it must have been boring for you to spend time with me.</p>
<p>“Well, not exactly.”</p>
<p>Jasmine smiled gently.</p>
<p>“I know that Charles cared for me a lot. At that time, my self-esteem was quite low, so having someone who genuinely cared for and loved me brought me a lot of joy and comfort. I received a lot from you too. Relationships can’t be measured solely by fun and interest.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for saying that. You’re still as kind as ever, Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Charles touched his ear and smiled awkwardly. They continued to chat for a while longer, engaging in pleasant and heartfelt conversation. At an appropriate moment, Charles hesitated before speaking.</p>
<p>“Jasmine, I’m leaving the empire soon.”</p>
<p>It was something she hadn’t expected. Jasmine, who had been sipping her tea, widened her eyes in surprise as he ran his hand through his short hair. Jasmine asked cautiously.</p>
<p>“May I ask what happened?”</p>
<p>“You might not remember, but my mother’s family comes from a foreign merchant lineage. My grandfather was very fond of me and left me a considerable inheritance at a young age. However, my maternal uncle, who took over the family business after my grandfather, couldn’t manage it well. He might have felt a great burden, being adopted from a distant relative to continue the family line,. Because of this, he didn’t get along well with my mother, and I only heard about it recently. Most of the family business has gone bankrupt, with only one crucial enterprise barely surviving.”</p>
