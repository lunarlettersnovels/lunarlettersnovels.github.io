            <p><strong>Chapter 38.2</strong></p>
<p>Tutting, Jilian shook his head. It was a congratulatory occasion that the eccentric cousin, who adhered strictly to the etiquette books, finally fell for a woman.</p>
<p>Even more fortunate that she’s the daughter of the Liovanni family but anything with too much passion—someone was bound to get hurt.</p>
<p>“It’s not simply because of Your Majesty’s request.”</p>
<p>“Of course. I know you won’t do something you don’t like. Fortunately, she seems to like you, too.”</p>
<p>If their hearts communicate, then nothing can be more perfect. Jilian shrugged and nodded.</p>
<p>“So? Are you going to the Royal Capital?”</p>
<p>Richard nodded. He already had the family ring. An heirloom handed down for generations from his mother, and he would need permission from the duke for the engagement to be official. First, he had to make Jasmine his fiancée.</p>
<p>“I have to get Jasmine’s permission. She might be embarrassed if I suddenly proposed.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad she knows how to be embarrassed.”</p>
<p>About to respond to the mean teasing remark, Richard suddenly turned his head towards the door.</p>
<p>He felt a presence. Was it a misconception? While staring at the silent door momentarily, Richard turned his attention back to Jilian when he began discussing a new issue.</p>
<p>For a while, they were busy discussing matters to be raised at the council meeting a week later.</p>
<p>And next to the slightly ajar door, Jasmine, leaning against the wall with her mouth covered, blinked her eyes quickly.</p>
<p>Their conversation, which she overheard by chance, lingered in her mind.</p>
<p><em>“I have to get Jasmine’s permission. She might be embarrassed if I suddenly proposed.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s not simply because of Your Majesty’s request.”</em></p>
<p>Her pale hands dropped, and then they balled into a fist.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Perhaps she shouldn’t have listened to that conversation.</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes, Richard was gone. It was the first time this had happened, and Jasmine rubbed her eyes, looking around.</p>
<p>The empty room felt strange and lonely. Come to think of it, she had almost always woken up with Richard, spending most mornings and evenings together.</p>
<p><em>Oh, this feeling is quite strange. </em>Jasmine scratched her head and put on a robe over her thin nightgown. Her entire body felt smooth, and a fragrant scent lingered.</p>
<p>Richard must have bathed her again. Somehow, the scent reminded her of him, so she sniffed her sleeves before getting up.</p>
<p>A brunch with a savory aroma was arranged on a small table. Opening the lid, she saw waffles spread with honey and sprinkled with powdered sugar. She suddenly remembered how he used to boast playfully about being good at cooking.</p>
<p>“He’s kind of cute.”</p>
<p><em>Did you do this yourself? Surely not.</em></p>
<p>Jasmine, licking honey off her finger, looked around again, searching for traces of Richard. She even checked the bathroom, thinking he might be washing up, but he wasn’t there. Considering the dampness, he must have left not long ago.</p>
<p>Jasmine playfully tilted her head before finally putting down her fork. Though hungry, she didn’t feel like eating for some reason.</p>
<p>“Where did he go?”</p>
<p>Did he go out? While pondering, she suddenly remembered their conversation where they shared their feelings. Richard persistently asked what she wanted, and after hesitating, Jasmine simply said she wanted to receive a flower.</p>
<p><em>“A flower? Just a flower?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Just a flower. How many flowers does it take to make a woman happy and excited? We don’t ask for extravagant things. We want something small.”</em></p>
<p>Anyway, men don’t understand anything.</p>
<p>As Jasmine grumbled, Richard, who had misunderstood her, playfully laughed and buried his face in her hair. A scent resembling the sweet fragrance of fruits wafted from her lush golden hair. It was her natural odor tinged with a faint perfume.</p>
<p>Now, waking up with this scent had become unexpectedly familiar. It felt exhilarating, comfortable, and reassuring.</p>
<p><em>“Okay, I was wrong.”</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t just one flower. Richard kissed her eyelids and whispered.</p>
<p><em>“I will build a flower garden and offer one flower or even a few bouquets.”</em></p>
<p>The tenderness and affection were so enchanting and heart-fluttering that Jasmine felt like her heart was blooming with flowers.</p>
<p>Lost in reminiscence, Jasmine scratched her flushed cheek absentmindedly before abruptly getting up.</p>
<p>She missed him.</p>
<p>Maybe he was in the garden? It could be wishful thinking, but would he bring her flowers? She couldn’t have imagined it in the past, but the Richard she now knew was a man capable of such gestures.</p>
<p>How could he live with such a personality, being so meticulous, affectionate, and unhesitant in expressing it?</p>
<p>Of course, there are things you can’t do if you’re stuck. As a member of the social world, Jasmine also knew to some extent how men in the early stages of her relationship did not hesitate to cheat on their loved ones.</p>
<p>Oh, how mighty love is…</p>
<p>Smiling contentedly, Jasmine walked down the corridor and suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Love? Love? Richard, <em>me</em>?</p>
<p>“Pfft!”</p>
<p>Jasmine laughed awkwardly and fanned herself, embarrassed by her thoughts.</p>
<p>But the emerging realization and intuition were rampant, bouncing around mercilessly, echoing through her heart.</p>
<p>Her face gradually reddened, resembling a blooming human rose. And it became more and more serious.</p>
