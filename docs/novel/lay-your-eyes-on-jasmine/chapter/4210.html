            <h3>Chapter 75.1</h3>
<p>“Pardon? Why have you come….”</p>
<p>As they were expressing their curiosity, they soon recalled how the commander’s sister used to frequently visit the Duke of Aion, almost as if it were her own home. It had been a while since the Lady Liovanni last visited.</p>
<p>Reading their expressions, Jasmine waved her hand and got straight to the point. Da.mn, she didn’t like the idea of the entire empire knowing about her black past.</p>
<p>“I have some business with the Order of the White Knights….”</p>
<p>Oh, come to think of it, it’s awkward to just visit out of the blue. Initially, she planned to bring Caras along and drop by casually, but what excuse could she use?</p>
<p>Ah, yes, she could use the pretext of discussing Marian’s matters and try to gauge his reaction over tea. After all, they had already had a fierce encounter once before.</p>
<p>Finally, after more than three days of his wife’s absence, Mr. Soyer’s patience wore thin, and he barged in yesterday. Naturally, Marian refused to meet him and locked herself in her room, leaving Jasmine to deal with the furious husband.</p>
<p>“Hello, Sir Soyer.”</p>
<p>“Where is Marian?”</p>
<p>The fact that he jumped straight to the point showed how angry he was. However, Jasmine, who had dealt with the empire’s most elite and socially high-ranking men since childhood, remained unruffled despite his murderous mood.</p>
<p>Instead, she crossed her arms and leisurely scrutinized the so-called ‘alleged adulterer.’ His fine, metallic silver hair, pale and handsome face, and deep, dark blue eyes—he was definitely good-looking enough to be one of the empire’s top five most handsome men.</p>
<p>If Richard resembled a graceful black wolf, Soyer looked like a silver fox living in an icy region. His cold and icy demeanor made him the epitome of a ‘cold beauty.’</p>
<p>Soyer’s chilliness was different from Richard’s stern elegance. During his bachelor days, Marian had to fend off countless women who targeted him.</p>
<p>Everyone who saw Soyer’s face back then knew he secretly liked Marian’s fierce protectiveness. They all knew how passionately he loved Marian and how their love was like a raging fire.</p>
<p>But to think this man had an affair. It still seemed unbelievable. There were men who might stray, but Soyer didn’t seem like one of them.</p>
<p>Jasmine tilted her head, thinking there must be some misunderstanding. Hadn’t he just barged into the duke’s house to take his wife back?</p>
<p>“Marian isn’t feeling well, so she’s resting.”</p>
<p>“How exactly is she unwell? Is it so serious that she can’t even reply to my letters?”</p>
<p>Why is he asking me this? She’s his wife. Jasmine shrugged.</p>
<p>“It’s not that serious. Don’t worry. It seems to be more of a mental issue. She’ll be fine once she regains her strength.”</p>
<p>At her subtle choice of words, Soyer’s face grew even colder. Wow, scary. If Jasmine didn’t know him, she would have shrunk back in fear.</p>
<p>“Ha, a mental issue….”</p>
<p>Soyer muttered as if chewing ice, and Jasmine wondered if he was actually a yeti, given the rapidly dropping temperature.</p>
<p>“Is it because of that ridiculous misunderstanding? Tell her to stop with the absurd delusions.”</p>
<p>His tone was merciless. He was so pissed off that he was grinding his teeth. Well, this man did have a temper, just like Marian.</p>
<p>If Richard was a principled, textbook figure exuding an air of academia, Soyer was always hot-tempered despite his cold exterior ( comparing the two distinguished men from prestigious families was a common pastime in social circles).</p>
<p>His background and skills were so impressive that he could get away with being aggressive and rough. His way of handling things was always forceful and unrefined. In addition to his nickname as the Ice Prince, he was also called the ‘Mad Dog with White Hair.’</p>
<p>It dawned on Jasmine that birds of a feather flock together. Even though they said he’d mellowed out after marriage, a person doesn’t change entirely.</p>
<p>“Well, excuse me, Sir Soyer. But isn’t it understandable for her to misunderstand? I don’t think Marian would act this way without a reason.”</p>
<p>Soyer’s silver eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p>“How many people would trust someone who keeps everything bottled up and only asks to be trusted?”</p>
<p>“Pardon my saying this.”</p>
<p>Soyer cut in stiffly before Jasmine could finish.</p>
<p>“No one knows Marian and our relationship better than I do. We’ve had that level of trust for that long. It’s Marian who is distrusting and destroying it. I swear by the gods, I have never broken our marriage vows.”</p>
<p>His tone was not just confident but outright arrogant, filled with barely contained fury. His following words made Jasmine frown.</p>
<p>“And problems between a husband and wife are not for others to meddle in.”</p>
<p>Please convey my regards to Marian. Tell her to come home immediately.</p>
<p>He spoke coldly and left, his coat flaring behind him. Though he was quick-tempered and furious, he walked away with the grace of a white deer.</p>
