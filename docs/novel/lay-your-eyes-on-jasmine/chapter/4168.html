            <h3>Chapter 96.2</h3>
<p>“Caras, brother, why are you doing this?”</p>
<p>“Stay quiet,” Caras said firmly.</p>
<p>“Your Grace may have forgotten, considering it a trivial matter, but you have already rejected my sister.”</p>
<p>Despite Caras’s hostile demeanor, Richard’s expression, which had been indifferent, finally faltered. A colder remark was poured over him.</p>
<p>“To be precise, it wasn’t just that one time that she was hurt. Jasmine had to endure disappointment and sadness many times over a long period. The last few times, the responsibility was clearly yours, Your Grace.”</p>
<p>“Lord Caras.”</p>
<p>However, Richard was unable to say anything. What could he say? He instinctively scanned Jasmine, driven by a desperate and earnest feeling, and his heart sank at the sight of her fragmented gaze.</p>
<p>She blinked blankly, as if suddenly realizing something anew, or as if she had just woken from a dream, facing a stark reality.</p>
<p>What could she be thinking? What thoughts are going through her mind? What is she recalling? Richard wanted to pull Jasmine to him right away, to hold her close and cover her ears. He wanted her to hear nothing, think of nothing, and only look at him. He wished she would consider only them, their relationship, and his own heart.</p>
<p>Unable to contain his fraying patience and anxiety, Richard finally called out to her.</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>“Caras, stop it.”</p>
<p>Jasmine intervened firmly, more so than ever before. She pulled her brother, who was gritting his teeth, and shook her head. She let out a weak sigh. Weariness was evident on her pale face.</p>
<p>“You’re too agitated right now. Let’s go back.”</p>
<p>“This is a warning, Your Grace. Never, ever approach my sister again.”</p>
<p>“I said stop it.”</p>
<p>Jasmine sighed as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Please forgive the rudeness, Duke. I apologize on his behalf. We will take our leave now.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Why did that one phrase of apology for rudeness sound particularly cold? Richard was frozen not by the words Caras had hurled at him, but by the short phrase Jasmine had uttered. Throughout the resolution of the situation, and even as she left with her brother and friend, Jasmine never once looked back at him. Despite surely feeling his desperate gaze.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After that day, they never met again. There was no contact or visit from Richard. Perhaps it was to be expected. In fact, it was their previous interactions that had been strange, as if under a spell by the allure of autumn.</p>
<p>Jasmine gazed out the window at the leaves beginning to fall one by one, lost in thought. Wrapped in a shawl, she held a mug of warm milk tea, contemplating the ripening of autumn and the day they had parted that way.</p>
<p>“Caras, why did you do that? That person is your superior officer.”</p>
<p>“Whether he’s my superior or even the Crown Prince, I wouldn’t let him be. What right does he have to hover around you? Da`mned guy. Just let him show up one more time. I might even challenge him to a duel.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that. I just happened to receive some help from him, that’s all.”</p>
<p>On the way back after dropping off Nikki, Jasmine sighed as she half-soothed and half-scolded Caras, who was pouting.</p>
<p>Although she didn’t think Richard would act that way, she was worried that being too rude to the head of the military, where she would continue to be involved, might cause unnecessary friction. Caras scoffed at her words.</p>
<p>“Nothing happened? You were crying! And did you see the way that guy looked at you? Shameless bastard.”</p>
<p>Usually, he acted like a gentle bear, but in situations like this, he behaved like a raging bear whose territory had been invaded. Jasmine swallowed.</p>
<p>Honestly, she could somewhat understand the concern and worry for her, and his hostility toward Richard.</p>
<p>If it were her friend or family who had suffered from unrequited love for a long time, only to be heartbroken, and then, their first love comes back to them half a decade later.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t they be a bit tired of it by now? How many years has it been? They probably thought there was no progress and no maturity. Jasmine knew it wasn’t something to be proud of, having her life tossed around because of one man.</p>
<p>She gave a half-defeated, amused smile.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, brother. I might not seem reliable, but I’ll handle it myself.”</p>
<p>Seeing Jasmine’s expression, Caras was momentarily at a loss for words. Then he muttered a curse under his breath, probably aimed at Richard, as he looked out the window. She chuckled softly.</p>
<p>“But when did you start seeing Nikki?”</p>
<p>“Ahem, well, that, um. It just happened.”</p>
<p>“I had my suspicions.”</p>
<p>Jasmine, with her chin propped on her hands, grinned broadly.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, brother. Nikki’s a good person. Treat her well.”</p>
<p>“Jasmine.”</p>
<p>Caras sighed.</p>
<p>“You’ll find someone good too.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Someone who will only look at you, love you, and never hurt you. You’re a girl who deserves that kind of love a hundred times over.”</p>
<p>I can’t stand to see you cry anymore. Jasmine laughed as if she was about to cry, under Caras’s gloomy, slightly apprehensive, and worried gaze.</p>
<p>“Yes. I understand.”</p>
