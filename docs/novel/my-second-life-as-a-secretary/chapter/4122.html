            <p><strong>Chapter 11.2 – The Outstanding New Transfer</strong></p>
<p>“Huh?” He Zening blinked owlishly at him. She didn’t expect the other party would stop her so solemnly just to gossip!</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was no secret that Bai Yinan became Gu Siye’s secretary. So, it was all right to tell him. After she shared Bai Yinan’s upcoming appointment as the president’s secretary, Mr. Fu showed an intense expression as if he was absorbed by the news. Then to He Zening’s surprise, he solemnly said, “Gu hid it deep enough…”</p>
<p>He Zening recalled her responsibilities as the president’s secretary at this time and refrained from joining in. She also said in the same solemn tone, “Mr. Fu, this is just a common personnel transfer in our company.”</p>
<p>Mr. Fu glanced at her and raised his eyebrows. “You are loyal. What treatment did Gu give you?” he asked. This time there was no sarcasm or hidden malice.</p>
<p>“I’m just doing my duty,” she answered him. He Zening felt that after she gave him her reply, Mr. Fu was now appraising her differently, perhaps more positively than before.</p>
<p>“If you can’t stay with Gu in the future, you can come to my side,” he said proudly, leaning casually on the sofa.</p>
<p>He Zening felt slightly touched. Was this a nod of approval? Was he recruiting her because he recognized her ability and integrity?</p>
<p>Gu Siye was a person who was very stingy when it came to encouraging people. In her experience, he was someone who had never spoken words of encouragement.</p>
<p>Since it was also her first time to work as a secretary, she had no other experience and had to explore and learn many things on her own. She still remembered her first day in the company, where she trembled constantly at the slightest task, in fear that if she could not do well, she would not be able to pass the internship period.</p>
<p>This was the first time someone had praised her work performance. It was better than any reward.</p>
<p>Mr. Fu noticed the abrupt change in the other party’s mood. He was also wondering what made her moved when he barely said anything.</p>
<p>At first, this secretary didn’t leave a deep impression on him. In fact, he couldn’t remember her appearance at all, other than that she looked pleasing to the eyes. But compared to Gu’s secretaries prior to her, her looks were not as impressive. However, he came to know that she was honest, practical and obedient… it was practically the kind of subordinate every boss would want.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when He Zening realized Mr. Fu was looking at her weirdly, she quickly composed herself. She hurriedly said, “Thank you, Mr. Fu for recognizing my efforts. Please let me know if there is anything I can do for you in the future.”</p>
<p>“I’m not so poor that I need to use someone else’s secretary. Go ahead and call me when Gu is ready.”</p>
<p>“Alright…”</p>
<p>Perhaps because the atmosphere now was just too warm, He Zening became more courageous. She took two steps before turning around and said, “Mr. Fu, may I ask you a question?”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>She asked him, feeling a trace of embarassment, “I’ve only been here for a short time, and I only know that everyone calls you Mr. Fu… If I may know what your full name is…”</p>
<p>This problem had really bothered her for a long time. She had checked Isabella’s information before, but there was no one named Fu in the shareholder information. Before she could finish explaining, the other party replied.</p>
<p>“Fu Han. My name is Fu Han,” he said.</p>
<p>“Understood. Thank you, Mr. Fu.”</p>
<p>He Zening left the reception room contentedly after getting the answer. Mr. Fu’s name was unexpectedly very simple compared to his heavy surname. Still, his name sounded quite nice.</p>
<p>After their conversation, He Zening was inside the office until Gu Siye was finally ready to see Mr. Fu. She then hurriedly ran to the reception room to inform the other party. Not long after Mr. Fu was brought into the office, Assistant Zheng walked over with documents in his hand.</p>
<p>“Zening, is Mr. Gu free?” he asked her.</p>
<p>She shook her head and pointed to the President’s Office. “Mr. Fu just went in,” she replied.</p>
<p>Assistant Zheng replied with an “Oh” and said “Then I might need to wait a little. Can you give this document to Mr. Fu for his signature later?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>After handing in the documents, Assistant Zheng didn’t leave in a hurry. Instead, he stayed and chatted with He Zening about the new transfer. “Have you read the notice issued by the HR department?” he asked.</p>
<p>He Zening nodded. “Yeah, I did. I heard someone is being transferred over,” she said.</p>
<p>“Do you know the new colleague?”</p>
<p>“I do. You can rest assured that she is a good person. She’s a nice person to get along with.”</p>
<p>“That’s good…” Assistant Zheng sighed. Although he was only in his twenties, he always gave He Zening the illusion of an old father who liked to worry a lot. “I’ve been in Zhenfeng for more than three years, and the secretary turnover rate is still so high. I hope she lasts a little longer.”</p>
<p>“You can relax,” He Zening said firmly, “this new colleague is definitely better than me.”</p>
<p>She wanted to add further: <em>‘Not only will she be a secretary to the president – she’ll also be the wife of the president in the future!’</em></p>
