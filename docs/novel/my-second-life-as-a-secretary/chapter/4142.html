        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 1.2 – The President’s Surname is Gu</strong></p>
<p>After one week in the office, He Zening felt that President Gu had indeed the distinctive qualities of a President <em>and</em> a male protagonist. He was handsome, rich and capable, and had a good family background. Beyond that, he was composed, regarded others with a certain aloofness, especially females.</p>
<p>The first day she was at work, she overheard President Gu telling the secretary who quit, to use less perfume. Since that day, He Zening had put away all her perfume.</p>
<p>She also noticed another small detail. President Gu disliked taking things directly handed over to him by his secretaries. He only picked up an item after it was laid down on his table. This peculiar behavior puzzled He Zening; she couldn’t help but feel like he had a problem…</p>
<p>It was common for a rich, cold President in a novel to have undisclosed problems, perhaps troubled past, or aversion to physical intimacy. She felt that Gu belonged to the last category. Of course, there was no way for her to verify her suspicions; she was more concerned about keeping her job. Despite being a novel world, realistically speaking, she would get into financial trouble without this job.</p>
<p>The He Zening she had transmigrated into had a simple background. Her parents died when she was young and thus, she was raised by her grandparents. Sadly, her grandparents passed away while she was in college. She was only able to graduate with the money they left her. After that, she worked in another company for two years before she job-hopped to Zhen Feng Group.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, she did not know how she made it through the interview. Shouldn’t they have hired someone with better credentials? But on second thought, maybe the story did not require logical and meticulous personnel.</p>
<p>He Zening had decided to become serious in her job because Zhen Feng’s pay and benefits were above industrial average. She would set a standard of excellence, a code of conduct, for herself; whether or not this was a novel had no bearing on her decision. If she could work while watching the story unfold, that would be a bonus.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the main characters are usually the ones who have the drama. Spectators are hardly affected, unless they intentionally cause trouble. She should be safe…</p>
<p>Other than work, He Zening was looking forward to the appearance of the heroine and how it would change the workaholic President Gu. If he was not in the office, he was on the road; that man had no private life or activities outside his company responsibilities. His hectic lifestyle prevented him from meeting potential partners.</p>
<p>Because of that, there were many female employees in the office who had set their sights on him. For example, one of the secretaries that had just left was from a wealthy family who owned a business. She didn’t even need this job! She would dress up daily to work, hoping to draw his attention, but he was unmoved. Eventually, she gave up and left. As for the other secretary fired by Gu, He Zening had no idea what happened.</p>
<p>He Zening was not drop dead gorgeous, but she was still attractive. She just needed to dress up a bit, but for practical reasons, she never did. Her casual appearance must be the reason why her female colleagues are friendly to her, when they are naturally hostile to each other. Was it because they perceived her as less of a threat?</p>
<p>Now that both secretaries had left, He Zening’s other female colleagues were eagerly attentive to her, perhaps because they would like the opportunity to fill these positions. Little did they know, she had no say whatsoever in the hiring process. The Human Resources department and Special Assistant Zheng made all the hiring decisions. Thus, she played dumb to avoid discussing this subject in front of her colleagues.</p>
<p>After forty minutes in the office, she got a call from Special Assistant Zheng informing her that the meeting was almost over. She immediately stood up, got the documents ready and headed downstairs.</p>
<p>Zheng Wen Ang was waiting for her outside the conference room. He was around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old and had graduated from a prestigious university. Moreover, he was good looking, mature and dependable. She thought he fits all the qualities of a male protagonist, but in this story, he was merely another employee like her.</p>
<p>“Miss He, you are here. The meeting is almost over,” he said.</p>
<p>He Zening nodded. “Okay.”</p>
<p>“You just started but we have already kept you quite busy. It must be difficult for you.”</p>
<p>She was supposed to wait outside the conference room while the meeting was in progress. But Zheng had let her take a break considering how busy she had been.</p>
<p>“But President Gu is fair,” he continued. “Since you have been so busy, I am sure he will reward you with a bonus.”</p>
<p>Hearing the word bonus, He Zening could not help but laugh. Where else can you find such a good boss? “That would be wonderful!” she said.</p>
<p>Special Assistant Zheng also laughed. He was fond of this young secretary; she was carefree, straightforward, and approachable.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. You won’t be busy for too long since there’s a new hire. I heard she is well-qualified.”</p>
<p>“That’s very good news.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, He Zening immediately perked up. Could this new secretary be the heroine?</p>
