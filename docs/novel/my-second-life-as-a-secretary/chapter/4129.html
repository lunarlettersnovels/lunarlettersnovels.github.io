            <p><strong>Chapter 8.1 – Who Is The Real Protagonist?</strong></p>
<p>She had never been so shaken. She always thought she had no feelings for Gu Siye because she had no desire whatsoever. The meeting with Lu Zhanyuan today made her realize that Gu Siye was just not her type.</p>
<p>But life moves on; she could only admire him from afar. In a melancholy mood, He Zening attempted to listen to both parties discuss technical aspects of the business, but she could not follow. She turned around, saw special assistant Zhang busily take notes, and felt utterly useless.</p>
<p>The meeting lasted a little over an hour. After sitting through most of the meeting, she could roughly make out the substance of the meeting. Zhen Feng intended to adopt technology from Ling He to advance a certain research project. The two companies were still in the initial phase of discovery. Going deeper required more technical exchange, which she would not be able to comprehend.</p>
<p>Gu Siye and Lu Zhanyuan had quite a delightful interaction. After the meeting, Lu Zhanyuan even invited Gu Siye for dinner to further their discussions. Gu Siye accepted the invitation.</p>
<p>Finally, it was time to leave. They were outside the conference room. He Zening helped Special Assistant Zheng pack up the documents. She tentatively asked, “Special assistant Zheng, do we also need to go to dinner?”</p>
<p>“No, we don’t. It’s a private invitation.”</p>
<p>“Oh, good!” He Zening tried to squash down her slight disappointment. “This is my first time meeting President Lu. I never expected him to be so young and good-looking.”</p>
<p>Special Assistant Zheng turned to He Zening. “What happened? Are you eyeing him?” he teased. “President Lu is a hot bachelor, Miss He. Don’t act rashly.”</p>
<p>“You overthink it. I am merely expressing my admiration for someone with extraordinary achievements.” Seeing that special assistant Zheng wanted to continue the conversation, she hurriedly picked up the rest of the documents, and nudged him along. “Let’s go! President Gu is waiting for you to give him a ride.”</p>
<p>Special Assistant Zheng smiled knowingly. He followed He Zening as she tried to rush out before him from the conference room.  Lu Zhanyuan had already accompanied Gu Siye to the elevator. The two managed to catch up.</p>
<p>Lu Zhanyuan saw the two of them and bid Gu Siye farewell. “I still have some matters to take care of, so I won’t be going down with you. I’ll send you the location of the dinner shortly. President Gu, I wish us a happy cooperation,” he said.</p>
<p>Gu Siye nodded. “Happy cooperation,” he replied.</p>
<p>By the time they all got back to the office, it was almost time to get off work. All urgent matters had also been taken care of. Unable to resist the urge, He Zening went online and searched Lu Zhanyuan.</p>
<p>It was evident that he was a genius who shocked the nation, as her search resulted in all kinds of news. She picked out a few to read. Lu Zhanyuan was just like how Special Assistant Zheng described him to be; his experience was legendary, and his resume was second to none.</p>
<p>The fact that he was a distinguished bachelor and appeared in the same world as the protagonist, Gu Siye, made no sense to He Zening. The only obvious explanation was that he was also part of the story, but she couldn’t make heads or tails as to his role.</p>
<p><em>‘Could it be possible that I had recognized the wrong person for the protagonist?’</em> He Zening questioned herself. According to everything that had happened so far, Gu Siye unequivocally played the role of a protagonist. He Zening could not accept the fact that she might be wrong.</p>
<p>Special assistant Zheng was getting off work. He passed by, and seeing He Zening in front of the computer, he asked, “Miss He, aren’t you leaving yet? Overtime?”</p>
<p>He Zening hurriedly shook her head and closed all traces of stalking. “No, not really. I’m leaving in a few minutes,” she replied.</p>
<p><em>‘Let it go, don’t overthink it.’ </em>She comforted herself, <em>‘Just take it one step at a time. If the worst comes to worst, just apply to Ling He.’</em></p>
<p>But, of course, that was just her grumbling. Zhen Feng paid so well, and the working environment was excellent; she was emotionally attached to this place. Not to mention, she might not even qualify for a position at Ling He.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Since the meeting between Lu Zhanyuan and Gu Siye, both sides have reached a preliminary agreement in terms of cooperation. Thus, the exchanges between the two companies have become more frequent. Gu Siye had no need to visit Linghe personally anymore, either. He Zening also lost the opportunity to meet Lu Zhanyuan again. With no more temptation, all the disruptive thoughts faded away.</p>
<p>This afternoon, she went for lunch at the cafeteria. Since there was no new secretary hired, there were only three employees on the Presidential floor: He Zening, Gu Siye, and Special Assistant Zheng.</p>
