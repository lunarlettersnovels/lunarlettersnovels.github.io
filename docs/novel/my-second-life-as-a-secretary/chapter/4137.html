<p><strong>Chapter 4.1 – The Heroine’s Drunk</strong></p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>He Zening walked up to her. Almost instantly, she was hit by a strong smell of alcohol. She took a closer look at the girl and was amazed by her beauty. Most of the beauties she had met so far had heavy make-up, strong contours and distinct features, but the lady in front of her had softer features; an oval face with a rounded chin, almond eyes and cheeks with some baby fat. Her face was akin to a typical heroine.</p>
<p>When He Zening came back to her senses, she realized Gu Siye was staring at her, frowning, as if he was saying she shouldn’t expect any bonus soon.</p>
<p>She quickly helped pull the girl away from Gu Siye. The girl was drunk, completely unaware of what was going on, and in her state of inebriation, she shouted, “How can you treat me like this… Fei Fei is my sister!”</p>
<p>He Zening listened and deduced this might be about a fiancé or boyfriend cheating on her with her sister. This trope was kind of old and cliche, and is almost used in most CEO novels.</p>
<p>But feeling Gu Siye’s negative aura, He Zening quickly did some damage control. “Get ahold of yourself! You have the wrong person!” she explained.</p>
<p>After some struggle, He Zening was finally able to help President Gu get rid of the girl.  She started pondering what to do next. It was not right to bring a drunk heroine home without having her interact with the male lead. Perhaps she was currently destined to be their matchmaker. She looked at President Gu. Was she supposed to tell President Gu to bring the girl home? It did not feel right.</p>
<p>Then, Gu Siye stretched his hand out to He Zening. He Zening was alarmed. <em>‘What does he want? It can’t be me. How outrageous!’ </em>she almost scooted away from him.</p>
<p>Gu Siye’s voice interrupted her train of thoughts. “Car key,” he merely said, with a schooled expression.</p>
<p>“Ah? Oh! Okay.”</p>
<p>The secretary inside He Zening finally reacted. She hurriedly pulled out the car key from her bag and handed it over to President Gu.  She also pulled out a piece of wet wipes and gestured to his suit. The girl had spilled wine on his suit. Gu Siye took the wipes. In the next moment, he let her know he would be driving home himself and she would stay and take care of matters here; her taxi fares would be reimbursed.</p>
<p>“Okay, President Gu. Drive safe,” He Zening responded perfunctorily. After Gu Siye left, she started to wonder what he meant by “take care of matters here.”</p>
<p>In other stories, the protagonists do not usually show up at the beginning. He would let his secretary take care of things. In this story, the secretary would be <em>her</em>. He Zening felt a rush of excitement; it looks like her transmigration was not without purpose. There was nothing thrilling in her day-to-day activities, but at this moment, she felt instantly motivated!</p>
<p>What will she do with the heroine now? She thought about it, caught a glimpse of the passing waitress, and stopped her. “Please help!” she said.</p>
<p>The waitress stopped, asking politely, “How can I be of service?”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>He Zening had a straightforward idea. This was Fu Shao’s bar; Fu Shao is Gu Siye’s best friend. She just needed to convince Fu Shao to let her use one of the rooms so the girl could get some rest. The plan was simple, but she needed to work out a few issues. First, the waitress didn’t know her or Gu Siye. Second, how can she approach Fu Shao?</p>
<p>“Can you do me a favor?” He Zening pointed towards the girl she was struggling to hold onto. “Can you give me a hand? I need to talk to Fu Shao,” she said, using his name casually.</p>
<p>Upon hearing Fu Shao’s name, the waitress’s expression changed. She respectfully said, “All right! where do you want to take her?”</p>
<p>“Let’s bring her upstairs.”</p>
<p>The girl was skinny, so the two of them were able to carry her upstairs without much trouble. Once they were upstairs, the waiter He Zening had previously encountered arrived to assist them. He Zening clarified the circumstances, and they collaborated to bring the girl to a private room. Now, all she had to do was to knock on Fu Shao’s door and speak to him.</p>
<p>Fu Shao was surprised upon seeing her. “Has Gu not left yet?” he asked.</p>
<p>He Zening quickly explained the situation. Fu Shao raised his eyebrows after she was finished. “Did you just say Gu made you stay to take care of this girl?”</p>
<p>Fu Shao’s ‘take care of the girl’ and Gu Siye’s ‘take care of the matter’ appear to be similar to He Zening, so she cautiously nodded. “Kind of,” she said.</p>
<p>Fu Shao looked amused. He waved his hand and said, “Use the room as you wish.”</p>
