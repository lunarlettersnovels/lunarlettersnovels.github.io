<p><em><strong>Chapter 7.1 – Glasses Are Totally My Type</strong></em></p>
<p>Soonafter Bai Yinan was ready, the car that He Zening had booked also arrived. The two departed for the venue of the party – a high-end private club. Bai Yinan was about to open the door and get off when the car arrived at the entrance, but He Zening stopped her.</p>
<p>Bai Yinan looked at her puzzled. “What’s wrong, Zening? Are we not getting out?” she asked.</p>
<p>He Zening shook her head. “Let’s wait for a minute,” she replied.</p>
<p>In He Zening’s mind, the heroine should be the last one to appear. The heroine amazes the audience without even knowing it herself. She was well versed in such plots. If the novel was to be <em>any</em> good, it must have a scene written like this. Since the author was absent, she could only enrich the story herself.</p>
<p>As they waited, cars would stop at the entrance of the clubhouse. From time to time, well-dressed men and women would enter the clubhouse; there were also some celebrities among them. Bai Yinan obviously realized that the party was not as simple as she thought. She couldn’t help but try to calm herself down.</p>
<p>He Zening hadn’t been paying attention to Bai Yinan. She held her phone in one hand, and stared outside with attentive eyes. She was waiting for Gu Siye to appear. After an unknown period of time, she saw Gu Siye’s car appearing in her field of vision. As a secretary, she had to memorize the plate number of her boss’ car by heart.</p>
<p>“He’s here,” she said to herself subconsciously.</p>
<p>Bai Yinan asked curiously, “Who is?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s nothing. Do give me a minute. I’ll go and say hello,” He Zening replied. Bai Yinan agreed obediently and waited in the car as He Zening got out.</p>
<p>He Zening walked to the side of the road waving at the car. The car slowed down and stopped by the road not too far from her. As soon as she leaned over, the rear window rolled down and Gu Siye’s face was revealed. Even though they met every day, she couldn’t help but still feel dizzy after being caught off guard by a handsome and compelling face.</p>
<p>“Mr. Gu, the arrangement for my replacement has been sorted out,” she began, going straight to the point. Although Gu Siye said before that he didn’t have too many requirements for his female companion, it was still better to explain the details. “The name of the girl I invited is Bai Yinan. She’s the girl you met at the bar two days ago. She expressed guilt for soiling your coat, so I invited her to help.”</p>
<p>Gu Siye didn’t say anything. Since there was no objection, she took his silence as agreement. He Zening was now even more convinced that she had taken the right step. She pointed to the car that Bai Yinan was sitting in and said,</p>
<p>“Miss Bai has already arrived. Shall I invite her over now?”</p>
<p>“I’ll go over,” President Gu replied. He Zening immediately opened the car door for Gu Siye and led him to the front of Bai Yinan’s car. Then, she opened the car door in front of him.</p>
<p><em>‘Finally, here comes their historic meeting!’ </em>she thought giddily.  Strictly speaking, this is the first time the male and female protagonists would officially meet. If nothing unexpected happens, they would naturally fall in love at first sight and slowly build a relationship from thereon.</p>
<p>As the acting-director of the story, He Zening covertly watched the expressions of the two leads. Gu Siye was so good at hiding his expression that she couldn’t see any fluctuations of emotions on his face. On the other hand, Bai Yinan’s expression was easier to understand. She was at first shocked, but her expression returned to normal fairly quickly.</p>
<p>She greeted him in a normal manner. “Hello, Mr. Gu.” This was indeed a good start. Most women in this world would exaggerate when they first met Gu Siye, but Bai Yinan treated him more like a normal person. Of course, Gu Siye who is used to being flattered would become attracted to the opposite.</p>
<p>“Hello,” he began, nodding, “I appreciate your help today.”</p>
<p>It was an ordinary conversation, but in He Zening’s view, it was the beginning of love… She firmly believed that they would fall in love!</p>
<p>She helped Bai Yinan get out of the car. As expected, the male and female protagonists looked really good standing next to each other.</p>
<p>“Then I wish the two of you a good evening. I’ll make my leave first,” she said, trying to keep the excitement from her voice. Gu Siye nodded, and Bai Yinan softly said her goodbyes.</p>
<p>In fact, He Zening was struggling to decide whether she should continue watching the plot unfold or go home to rest. After thinking about it over and over again, she felt that there was little to miss since she was the secretary of the president; if anything, she had a VIP seat to the story! Moreover, her rest days were rarer than witnessing the plot before her eyes. Ultimately, she decided that it was better to go home and rest.</p>
<p>After a few more months of hard work and saving, perhaps it would be possible to move to a high-end apartment. She might even get one with a bathtub! It would be a treat for herself!</p>
<p>He Zening loves working more than anything else. That much was for sure.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>She didn’t know how the banquet went, but judging from Gu Siye’s mood the next day, she thought it hadn’t been too bad.</p>
<p>She originally wanted to ask Bai Yinan about it. But after thinking, she thought there was no time to be close to her, either professionally or privately. A major partnership was being discussed in the Zhen Feng group recently, and the vacant secretary position had not been filled for a long time. As a result, she had to work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. She didn’t have the energy to meddle in other people’s business, let alone have a lot of time to herself. She was all focused on her career.</p>
<p>A week passed by before she knew it.</p>
