<p><strong>Chapter 8.2 – Who Is The Real Protagonist?</strong></p>
<p>Gu Siye never ate at the employee’s cafeteria. She had a servant deliver meals to him on time every day at lunchtime. Special Assistant Zheng ate at the cafeteria, but he was a single man, so to avoid gossip, He Zening ate alone.</p>
<p>One reason He Zening stayed at Zhen Feng was the cafeteria. It offered a variety of choices and was inexpensive. She saved a lot every month just by dining there.</p>
<p>Today, the cafeteria had prepared the dishes she loved: braised eggplant and braised pork ribs. She happily filled up a whole plateful, found a clean seat and started eating. After a few bites, she caught a glimpse of a very familiar figure and froze instantly.</p>
<p>How come the woman dressed in a pale yellow dress sitting diagonally across from her looked so much like Bai Yinan? She took a few more glances, waiting for the woman to turn her head. When her features were clear to see, she confirmed that it was Bai Yinan.</p>
<p>The heroine showed up exactly where she should be.</p>
<p>He Zening was wondering if she should walk over to say hello, but she eventually decided to finish her meal first. Later on, she was not given the opportunity; by the time she finished eating, the chair was already occupied by another employee.</p>
<p>That was no big deal. Zhen Feng was huge, but it wasn’t impossible to find one person. Moreover, she recognized the person sitting across from Bai Yinan as an employee from the administration’s department. She frequently ran errands and came to deliver documents to them.</p>
<p>After lunch, He Zening strolled back through the 10th floor, passing by the administration department. Sure enough, she saw Bai Yinan inside the office.</p>
<p>She took out her cell phone and was about to call when a question popped up in her mind: <em>‘Why didn’t Bai Yinan give me a call when she came to work in Zhen Feng? Moreover, how did she get a job at Zhen Feng?’</em></p>
<p>Her intuition told her that this might have something to do with Gu Siye. Maybe he made the arrangements for her employment. In that case, she shouldn’t be calling  and be all nosey, but pretend to be ignorant until such time Bai Yinan reaches out to her. After some thinking, she reached a logical conclusion.</p>
<p>She put her cell phone back in her pocket and proceeded to step into the elevator. <em>‘Can’t Gu Siye even think of giving me a raise? Where else can he find such a responsible secretary like me?’ </em>He Zening sighed while pressing the floor button.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Bai Yinan’s appearance solidified Gu Siye’s role as the protagonist.</p>
<p>It was only Bai Yinan’s 3rd day of employment at Zhen Feng, but a lot of things had happened.</p>
<p>Her employment at Zhen Feng was purely accidental. She left Tang’s company a few days after submitting her resignation letter. She was not required to give a one-month notice because Tang Zhian wanted her gone as soon as possible. Within a few days, the finance department had settled her last pay and she was officially unemployed.</p>
<p>She did not return home but stayed at Tian Jing’s home and remained idle. Eventually, Tian Jing urged her to look for a job. She sent out resumes, and one went to Zhen Feng, but she did not have high hopes of getting a job there.</p>
<p><em>‘It is a well-known company in the city, but with my qualifications, how can I possibly get a job there?’</em> she had conceded to herself.</p>
<p>She had never thought of using her relationship with He Zening, but she did not have many options, so she had to give Zhen Feng a try.</p>
<p>She arrived early for the interview. With nothing to do, she went to the coffee shop across the street. There, she met the coffee house’s owner, who was a young gentleman. After knowing she had an interview with the company, he enthusiastically gave her some suggestions. About half of his customers were from Zhen Feng so he knew a lot about the company.</p>
<p>Armed with his suggestions, she was lucky to pass Zhen Feng’s interview and was employed as an administrative specialist.</p>
<p>Since she got the job through her own effort, she was looking for a chance encounter at the company to give He Zening a surprise. But as the President’s secretary, He Zening seemed very busy, and Bai Yinan’s administrative position did not provide her with many opportunities to run into He Zening, so her plan for a reunion had been put aside for the moment.</p>
<p>She was new to the company, so she had to prove herself by working harder. She also had a lot of work to catch up on, which did not allow her time to think much about other things. It was almost time to get off work when her colleague suddenly asked her to deliver an urgent document to Ling He.</p>
<p>Bai Yinan knew Zhen Feng and Ling He were in the middle of a cooperation. After she received the documents, she rushed out the door; there was no time for delay. It took about half an hour to get a cab to Linghe, but she was able to walk into the lobby just before the company’s closing time.</p>
<p>She could never have predicted when she stepped into the elevator that there would be a power outage, followed by a loud bang. The elevator terrifyingly  hovered in the middle. Inside the elevator with her was a young gentleman wearing a pair of eyeglasses. The gentleman was exhibiting symptoms of panic after the elevator’s lights had turned off. He was leaning against the wall, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>She immediately went over and asked, “Are you alright, sir?”</p>
