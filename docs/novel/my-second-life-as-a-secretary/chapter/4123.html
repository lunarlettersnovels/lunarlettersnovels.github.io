            <p><strong>Chapter 11.1 – The Outstanding New Transfer</strong></p>
<p>After He Zening got home, she tasted the bread. It was as delicious as the one she had before. Even if she didn’t like drinking coffee, she would visit the cafe just for its pastry.</p>
<p>The next day, Bai Yinan called her back.</p>
<p>“Ningning, I’m sorry,” Bai Yinan said from the other line, “Dr. Pei told me that you called me yesterday, but I was so tired I slept all day. I didn’t have time to call you back.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, your health is more important. How are you feeling now?” He Zening replied. The voice of the other party still sounded a little weak.</p>
<p>“My fever has gone down. I’ll be fine after resting for two more days.”</p>
<p>“How did it become so serious? It’s weird to have a fever in the summer.”</p>
<p>“Maybe I used the air conditioner too much.”</p>
<p>After exchanging pleasantries for a while, He Zening could finally voice out her complaints. “By the way, why didn’t you tell me when you were working in Zhenfeng? I had to find out by myself!” she said.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Bai Yinan was stunned. “How… how did you know?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you heard? I received the memorandum for the transfer; Bai Yinan from the Administration Department will be working in the President’s Office as a secretary. I thought it was a coincidence that a person with the same name and surname as yours showed up. But I didn’t expect that it was really you!”</p>
<p>Initially, Bai Yinan wanted to explain why she didn’t tell He Zening the news, but after hearing the new information about a transfer, she hurriedly asked, “They’re transferring me? What’s going on?”</p>
<p>He Zening was curious and remained silent for a while, thinking. “The HR Department already sent the notice today. You didn’t know?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I… I haven’t contacted the company for the past two days.”</p>
<p>“Ahh… maybe they didn’t inform you because you’re sick. It’s okay! What matters now is that the two of us will become colleagues in the future. That’s why, get well soon. I’ll be waiting for you in the office!”</p>
<p>“Okay…” He Zening could hear Bai Yinan’s unsure voice from the phone. Bai Yinan was also full of doubts. In fact, she didn’t even know how she was admitted to the hospital; Doctor Pei merely said that her <em>friend</em> brought her there. Although Doctor Pei seemed friendly, he was unusually tight-lipped and refused to share further information.</p>
<p>“Then I won’t disturb your rest now. Good bye!”</p>
<p>He Zening hung up the phone. She suddenly felt that her call was useless since  Bai Yinan knew nothing. Logically, however, it made sense. The heroine is generally ignorant to the plot; the male lead was also not vocal on telling his efforts to the heroine. In the end, the heroine would discover for herself, and this in turn would enhance their relationship.</p>
<p>In short, she was gathering information from the wrong party. She should have checked with Gu Siye, the perpetrator! But despite realizing this, He Zening knew it was another useless endeavor since Gu Siye surely wouldn’t have a heart-to-heart with her.</p>
<p>While she was ruminating, it just so happens that the phone rang. It was from the front desk giving her a notice that Mr. Fu had arrived. Since this wasn’t her first rodeo with a new character, He Zening’s reaction was lukewarm. She hung up the phone and called Gu Siye to notify him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Gu, Mr. Fu is here,” she said.</p>
<p>“I have something else going on,” Gu Siye replied amidst the sound of shuffling papers, “You have him to wait for a while.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the last time she saw Mr. Fu was half a month ago. Moreover, she didn’t hear any news about Mr. Fu when she was around Gu Siye despite Mr. Fu being his close friend. She thought about it carefully and came to a presumption that he was probably here to get the plot moving.</p>
<p>After a while, Mr. Fu came up. She hurriedly stood up and went out to greet him. “Hello, Mr. Fu. Please wait a moment as Mr. Gu is currently preoccupied.”</p>
<p>After speaking, she led him to the reception room next door. Since it was the CEO’s reception room, it was naturally not too shabby. It was as luxurious as an airport VIP lounge. She usually comes to rest here during lunch breaks.</p>
<p>After Mr. Fu sat down, she amicably asked, “Would you like mineral water, tea or coffee?”</p>
<p>Mr. Fu waved his hand. “No need,” he replied brusquely.</p>
<p>He Zening smiled. “Then please have a seat first. I’ll call you when Mr. Gu is ready.” She was about to leave after getting him settled, but she was suddenly stopped by the other party.</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>He Zening stilled. Did he want to ask her name again? She secretly cursed him in her heart. When she turned around, a professional smile was already on her face. “Do you need anything else, Mr. Fu?” she asked.</p>
<p>The other person pointed coolly at the sofa opposite of him and said – ordered, “Sit down. I have something to ask you.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>He Zening gingerly stroked the sides of her skirt as she sat down, carefully positioning her legs together in an elegant manner. She suddenly realized that she had never cared about these things before. However, ever since she became the president’s secretary, she had to take note of her appearance and mannerisms.</p>
<p>“How may I help, Mr. Fu?” she began.</p>
<p>“What happened to the girl that Gu asked you to take care of at the bar?”</p>
