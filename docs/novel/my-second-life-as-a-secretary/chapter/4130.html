            <p><strong>Chapter 7.2 – Glasses Are Totally My Type</strong></p>
<p>They were two major groups in City A, one was Zhen Feng and the other was Ling He. This afternoon, she was going to the Ling He Group with Gu Siye and Assistant Zheng.</p>
<p>On the way there, He Zening sat in the passenger seat and listened to Assistant Zheng share about Ling He’s history. Far from the family prestige Zhen Feng had accumulated for years, Ling He took the road of technological innovation. The founder of the company, Lu Zhanyuan, was only in his twenties this year. A few years ago, he invented a system that shocked the world. At that time, he was invited by all the big companies to join their companies. Instead of choosing one of them, he chose to create Ling He.</p>
<p>Under his management, Ling He had developed rapidly. Although its strength was not comparable to that of Zhen Feng, it must not be underestimated in terms of development trends.</p>
<p>“Mr. Lu of Ling He is about the same age as me, but he has already founded his own company. It’s admirable!” Assistant Zheng sighed with shame.</p>
<p>“Assistant Zheng, you’re also very impressive. As a law of nature, there will only be a few geniuses in this world. Don’t compare yourself to them and let that affect your mood,” He Zening comforted him, reminding him of what’s practical.</p>
<p>But she was also thinking that the boss of Ling He felt more like the male protagonist after she heard the character’s introduction. It was obvious that his character setting was more interesting…</p>
<p>“Xiao He, you don’t have to comfort me,”  Assistant Zheng sighed.</p>
<p>“My God, why would you consider this as me comforting you?” If it wasn’t for the seat belt, He Zening would have jumped up and shook him. “How many people in the world can become the special assistant to the president before the age of 30? You’re already very impressive!”</p>
<p><em>‘Think of what you have instead!’ </em>she thought, annoyed. She worked so hard every day just so she could save and move to a new apartment. She didn’t even dare to dream about buying a house! Even with an annual salary of seven figures, Assistant Zheng was still lamenting how he was not good enough. Indeed, it was difficult to communicate with people who think differently.</p>
<p>Seeing that He Zening had a bigger reaction, Assistant Zheng quickly reassured her. “Hey, calm down. I was just saying. Keep your voice low and be careful not to disturb Mr. Gu.”</p>
<p>As soon as she heard Gu Siye’s name, He Zening automatically fell silent. She took a deep breath, stabilized her emotions, and glanced back. There was a soundproof baffle between the front and rear of the car, and it seemed that there was no reaction from behind.</p>
<p>“But then again, you should also plan your career well for your future,” Assistant Zheng continued after some silence.</p>
<p>He Zening looked at him in askance. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You don’t plan to be a secretary all your life, do you?”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible,” she bluntly said. She would probably die an early death if she were to be a secretary all her life. “What would you suggest?”</p>
<p>Assistant Zheng advised her seriously, “Learn from Mr. Gu for a few years and then go work in the subsidiary for another few years. After that, you can come back to the headquarters. By then, you would have no problems being promoted to a middle-level manager.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t know it could work this way,” she replied, looking at him in amazement.</p>
<p>She had never worked in a large company, and there were almost no promotions from her translation job before. At most, she could be the manager of a foreign trade department. Of course, she didn’t know anything about career planning.</p>
<p>“Many people think that the position of a secretary does not have any technicalities to it. In actuality, it’s a difficult position. You have to deal with all kinds of people and aspects in the company. It’s much harder to find a good secretary than to find a special assistant,” he told her genuinely.</p>
<p>“Then I must work hard!” He Zening suddenly became a little bit more enthusiastic after being advised by Assistant Zheng.</p>
<p>He Zening was ignited with fighting spirit when they arrived at the headquarters of Ling He Group. Ling He did not have its own office building, but they rented seven or eight floors of a local high-end office building as their office. After registering at the front desk in the lobby, the three took the visitor cards and went up to the 18th floor. As soon as they exited the lift, a staff member came to greet them and took them to a conference room.</p>
<p>“Please wait a minute, Mr. Lu will be here soon.”</p>
<p>The gentle-looking staff served tea for the three of them. Since Gu Siye didn’t drink tea, He Zening had already prepared something else. She took out a thermos cup from her bag, which contained coffee she had packed in advance. She asked the staff for another empty cup and poured it for Gu Siye. Seeing this scene, Assistant Zheng quietly gave her a thumbs up under the table.</p>
<p>After a while, a handsome man wearing glasses walked in. As soon as he entered the door, he stretched out his hand towards Gu Siye with a smile. “Long time no see, Mr. Gu!” he said.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, Mr. Lu.” Gu Siye also shook his hand politely.</p>
<p>The moment Lu Zhanyuan appeared, He Zening’s eyes widened. How was Lu Zhanyuan so handsome?! He looked gentle, and he wore glasses?! It was just foul. He was completely her type! <em>‘OH MY GOD!’</em> He Zening could only fan-girl in her mind.</p>
<p>During that time, both Lu and Gu had already sat down and started talking about business. She quickly told herself to calm down. After taking a few deep breaths, she finally regained some sense of sanity. She raised her head and glanced at Lu Zhanyuan, who was sitting opposite of her. Then, her mind collapsed again.</p>
<p>She had decided that she would submit her resume to Ling He tomorrow!</p>
