            <p><strong>Chapter 36.1</strong></p>
<p>They weren’t alone. But Kwon Jae-heon didn’t seem to mind.</p>
<p>Right in front of them, Park Jung-hoon was watching with a scrunched-up face, and across the table, his sister was likely eavesdropping on their conversation. One reason she didn’t come over to their table was probably because she was enjoying the show.</p>
<p>“I know, I know, so stop it.”</p>
<p>Goyo was terrified of what Kwon Jae-heon might say next.</p>
<p>It was no secret that they had gone up to the hotel room together on Friday evening, but discussing the details out loud was a different story. Goyo felt like her body was on fire, with every sweat gland opening up.</p>
<p>“You forgot, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon looked at Goyo’s hand, which was still covering his mouth, with a mischievous expression, and then licked her palm with his tongue.</p>
<p>Goyo jerked her hand back, startled. The sensation of his warm, soft tongue on her skin made her face flush, and her heart started racing like crazy. Her mind was filled with warning signals, blaring like a siren.</p>
<p>“I spent the whole night kissing and biting you, it’s hard to forget, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s voice was low and husky, with a hint of a smile.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>How could she forget?</p>
<p>Goyo looked down, avoiding his gaze, and that’s when she noticed the bulge in his pants. It was a shape she was all too familiar with, having touched and kissed it countless times before.</p>
<p>The silhouette of his erection was etched in her mind, and she could almost feel the pulsing and the heat it had generated. She quickly closed her eyes, trying to shut out the memories, but it was too late.</p>
<p>The image of his penis, thrusting in and out of her, was already playing in her mind like a vivid movie. The way it had stretched her to her limits, making her feel like she was going to tear apart, and the pain that had accompanied it.</p>
<p>‘Ugh… it hurts.’</p>
<p>‘Spread your legs a bit more, relax, or it’s going to tear.’</p>
<p>She recalled bits of their exchange that night.</p>
<p>Every time he thrust his hips, his thick penis would plunge into her, and the sound of their bodies slapping together would echo through the air.</p>
<p>They had sex until dawn, and the experience was so intense that it was impossible to forget.</p>
<p>It was as if her body was branded with the memory of their encounter, and whenever she thought about it, her skin would tingle, her stomach would flutter, and her lower body would tremble. Goyo’s eyes fluttered open, and she felt a shiver run down her spine.</p>
<p>“If you had forgotten, you would have gotten hurt,” Kwon Jae-heon said, chuckling to himself, as if he knew exactly what she was thinking.</p>
<p>“Stop it,” Goyo said, trying to sound calm.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s voice and expression were too nonchalant, and she shouldn’t let herself get caught up in his words. She bit her lower lip, trying to moisten it with her tongue, but it still felt dry and painful.</p>
<p>That’s what a wound was – something that hurt when touched.</p>
<p>“I understand what you’re saying,” Goyo said in panic, trying to keep her voice steady.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon was just like a child who had found a new toy, fascinated by the novelty of it all. Just like Lee Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>She shouldn’t get excited about his fleeting interest, which would disappear as soon as his curiosity was satisfied. For now, she just needed to play along with his game, giving him what he wanted, but only until she got bored.</p>
<p>“Since you’ve agreed to this relationship, I’ll make it clear,” Goyo said, trying to sound confident.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon seemed satisfied with her response, and he began to talk, his words spilling out in a rush, punctuated by a snort of amusement.</p>
<p>“I’m a bit jealous. When we’re together, don’t look at other people, okay? Got it?”</p>
<p>It was like he was saying don’t cheat on him, and Goyo nodded in agreement, as she didn’t like that kind of relationship either.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you sorry for me?” He asked.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“You got caught cheating, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>Sometimes, it was hard to follow the conversation with him.</p>
<p>One moment they were fighting, the next they were making up, and then he would treat her like a plaything, only to suddenly act like she was his one and only. Goyo had thought she would just go along with what he wanted, but it was confusing to keep up with his pace.</p>
<p>“When did you and I start dating?”</p>
<p>Goyo asked, blinking her big eyes.</p>
<p>When did they become a couple, exactly? Dating wasn’t something you did alone, but Kwon Jae-heon seemed to be playing by his own rules.</p>
<p>To be precise, Goyo and Kwon Jae-heon had never even had a crush on each other. They had just met by chance at a violent crime scene a month ago, and then met again and had sex this time.</p>
