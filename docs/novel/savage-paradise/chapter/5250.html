            <p><strong>Chapter 58.2</strong></p>
<p>Why was he so reckless about the time and place? Now, even in the hallway? No matter how secluded it was, people could come by at any moment.</p>
<p>Hadn’t the prosecutor just explained in detail about public indecency? It’s human nature to want to do what one is told not to do, but this felt a bit excessive.</p>
<p>The prosecutor who was supposed to press charges had disappeared, but she was still surrounded by more than one bodyguard. Even now, she was pretending not to notice the two of them.</p>
<p>People continued to come and go through the banquet hall entrance behind the bodyguards. Inside were hundreds of guests attending the year-end party. The music blaring from the hall was loud even from here…</p>
<p>“…A-are you some kind of pervert?”</p>
<p>Goyo’s lips trembled slightly.</p>
<p>“I haven’t done anything. Yet.”</p>
<p>Jaeheon looked her in the eyes and spoke shamelessly.</p>
<p>Did he not realize that the word “yet” was the problem? It wasn’t denial—it was a warning.</p>
<p>“Whatever you’re imagining… it’ll be more than that.”</p>
<p>Jaeheon let out a soft, knowing chuckle, as if amused by his own thoughts.</p>
<p>Something brushed against her skin, his finger, making her jolt.</p>
<p>“…Gasp.”</p>
<p>He pushed her und*rwear aside and entered her.</p>
<p>“L-let’s go. T-to your office!”</p>
<p>At least the office would have a door. Goyo cried out in a panic and shook her head, but Jaeheon grabbed her face with both hands, looked into her eyes, and declared firmly:</p>
<p>“Too late. I can’t stop.”</p>
<p>“J-just stop! If you just pull—ah, ahh…”</p>
<p>Goyo’s pupils trembled violently. Something firm was pressing inside her, forcing its way through. Her thighs tensed from the sensation.</p>
<p>“Baby, I can’t stop now.”</p>
<p>“Not here… someone might… what would people think… ah…”</p>
<p>She clenched her fists and hit his forearm. He narrowed his eyes and replied in a slow, deliberate tone:</p>
<p>“Isn’t this the best part?”</p>
<p>“Y-you’re joking right now?”</p>
<p>Goyo’s vision blurred. No matter how much she tried not to care about others’ opinions, this crossed a line.</p>
<p>Never mind the party guests—what about the bodyguards? She frantically looked around.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>The bodyguards were nowhere to be seen, as if they had somehow predicted Jaeheon’s intentions. Not even an ant scurried nearby. The guests who had been lingering near the entrance were now back inside. Even the music, once blaring at full volume, had been turned down so low it was barely audible.</p>
<p>Had the guards cleared the area just so he could do as he pleased? How much influence did he have over the chief of staff to get away with this?</p>
<p>“Everyone’s busy. No one’s paying attention to us.”</p>
<p>Jaeheon’s eyes gleamed mischievously as he pulled her close with force.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Her vision clouded. A sharp sensation spread through her body, making her arch back involuntarily.</p>
<p>“S-snap out of it… th-this is humiliating… ngh…”</p>
<p>It was probably too late to stop this madness.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>“Isn’t this exciting? Look, it’s even—”</p>
<p>Jaeheon pulled her closer, grinding their bodies together. The movement sent a jolt through her entire body.</p>
<p>“Jaeheon, l-listen to me—wh-why are we doing this here…?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like I took off all my clothes. I just unzipped. Besides, your clothes cover everything.”</p>
<p>Jaeheon looked genuinely puzzled, as if he saw no issue.</p>
<p>But clothes or not, anyone could guess what was happening. The sounds, the movements—none of that could be hidden.</p>
<p>“You… didn’t hear what the prosecutor said…? P-public indecency… ah…”</p>
<p>Jae-heon gripped her waist, moving faster instead of stopping.</p>
<p>Each motion came with a jolt, his movements unpredictable, striking at angles that made Goyo’s body tremble uncontrollably. Her thoughts scattered as the pressure inside grew unbearable.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t into this kind of thing before. It’s your fault.”</p>
<p>From the moment she met Kwon Jae-heon, Goyo recalled, he had never once acted like a normal person. And now he had the nerve to pin this all on her.</p>
<p>“S-stop! I—this is…”</p>
<p>But he only sped up. Her body responded involuntarily, shivering every time he drove deeper. The intensity filled not just her stomach but every nerve ending in her body.</p>
<p>“You were about to curse at me, weren’t you? What was next—jerk, bastard, psycho? Honestly, say anything. It all turns me on.”</p>
<p>The rhythmic noise of bodies moving filled the room. The sound was dizzying, overwhelming her mind.</p>
<p>“Wait—are you seriously turned on just from cursing me out? Can you hear yourself?”</p>
<p>“T-that’s not… ha… ah…”</p>
<p>She tried to deny him, but every time he pushed deeper, only moans escaped. Jae-heon’s expression twisted, more unhinged with every passing second.</p>
<p>Her back arched against the table, making it tremble. A glass tipped over, red wine spilling onto the surface.</p>
<p>When she tilted her head back, her eyes caught something above.</p>
<p>“A CCTV camera…”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened in panic. With a trembling hand, Goyo pointed upward.</p>
<p>The security office can see everything. But surely they wouldn’t expose their own CEO… right? They’d turn it off. They had to.</p>
