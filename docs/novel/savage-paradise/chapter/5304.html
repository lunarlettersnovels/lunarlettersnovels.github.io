            <p><strong>Chapter 31.2</strong></p>
<p>Goyo sipped her cocoa and answered his pointless questions.</p>
<p>“Kwon Jae-heon was good to you? That can’t be right.”</p>
<p>“CEO Kwon is more considerate than I thought.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know what he was like to others, but he was kind to Goyo, at least. Yesterday, he even stopped Lee Yoon-gun’s violence.</p>
<p>His words and actions were rough, but she didn’t care. Until now, there were only people who pointed fingers and called her a lucky orphan behind her back, but no one had stepped forward to help Goyo.</p>
<p>“Kwon Jae-heon is considerate? Are you sure you’re not mistaking him for someone else…”</p>
<p>A woman calling the infamous Kwon Jae-heon considerate.</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon kept questioning Goyo’s words, as if he couldn’t believe his ears.</p>
<p>Maybe she felt that Kwon Jae-heon was considerate because she’d only seen the crazy Lee Yoon-gun. But no matter how much Lee Yoon-gun threw a fit and caused a ruckus, he couldn’t catch up to Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“I know this is a rude question, but are you perhaps of mixed heritage?”</p>
<p>It was a question she couldn’t answer.</p>
<p>Her father was a native Korean, but she didn’t know who her birth mother was. However, as she grew up, she noticed her unique appearance, different from others, and wondered if her birth mother might not be Korean. Her fair skin tone, unusually small head, and long arms and legs weren’t typical of the average Korean physique.</p>
<p>But Goyo’s father had never said her mother was a foreigner. He had said she was as pretty as a doll, though.</p>
<p>“Um, I just meant it as a compliment, I didn’t offend you, did I?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon wasn’t oblivious, but he also wasn’t someone who lived his life worrying about what others thought. As a result, discriminatory remarks like that were sometimes mixed in with the many words he spouted.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a question to ask Goyo, who was known to be an orphan. It was a question that could hurt her, but Goyo didn’t show any signs of being upset. She didn’t want to seem petty by making a fuss.</p>
<p>“I’m a bit direct, please don’t take it personally.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>She hid her bitter feelings and replied calmly.</p>
<p>…Is it really okay?</p>
<p>No, it couldn’t be. She was just deceiving herself into thinking it was okay, as she’d been trained to do by Lee Yi-taek.</p>
<p>Goyo’s mouth tasted bitter. She hadn’t done anything wrong, but her head kept hanging down. Unable to find the right words to say, she just fiddled with the cocoa cup on the table.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any prejudice against mixed-race people. My great-grandmother was American…”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon was explaining his values, even gesturing with his hands, when a low, resonant voice cut through his words.</p>
<p>“I told you not to listen to bullshit. It’ll spoil you.”</p>
<p>It was a voice she wanted to hear all day long, but not here, not now.</p>
<p>Even Park Jung-hoon, who had been talking non-stop in front of her, was stunned into silence by the sudden appearance of a third party, his mouth hanging open.</p>
<p>“You diligently ignored my calls, huh.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“Here you are.”</p>
<p>A cashmere coat, neatly creased dress pants, and luxurious men’s shoes suddenly entered her frozen gaze. At the same time, a heavy woody scent rushed to her nose.</p>
<p>Goyo barely suppressed a scream.</p>
<p>Thump, thump, thump. Her heart started beating so hard it felt like it would burst through her skin.</p>
