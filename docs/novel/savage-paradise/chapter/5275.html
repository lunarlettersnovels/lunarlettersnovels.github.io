            <p><strong>Chapter 46.1</strong></p>
<p>The soft moans and broken sounds slipping from her delicate lips sent a tingling sensation through him.</p>
<p>Was this what it felt like the first time he held a woman? His whole body burned with desire, and he couldn’t stop his hips from moving, thrusting into her again and again.</p>
<p>His foreskin felt raw from going at it all night, but the need didn’t stop. No matter how many times he took her, the hunger only deepened.</p>
<p>“Ahh, mm, haah…”</p>
<p>After only a few days, Goyo had become surprisingly adept at handling physical intimacy.</p>
<p>When she went down on him, she was like an enchantress. She’d been shy and hesitant at first, barely able to touch him properly, but now it was as if she knew exactly how to play with him. He came fast, like a teenager, more than once. And when she moved her hips slowly with him still inside her, it was enough to make him lose his mind.</p>
<p>Maybe she was just born for this.</p>
<p>It was insane… the way her arousal soaked him completely. Each time he slid inside her, wet, obscene sounds echoed between them. The sound alone was driving him wild, like he was high on something, thrusting harder without restraint.</p>
<p>“Haah, ngh, ah—jerk… damn… ugh, you’re… too much… ahh!”</p>
<p>Goyo had no idea what kind of thoughts were running through Jae-heon’s head. All she could do was cry out and squirm, overwhelmed by the intensity of his relentless rhythm.</p>
<p>She’d wanted to say something like, Even dogs can’t go all night—I’m too exhausted, but her tongue twisted, and her words slurred from the force of his movements.</p>
<p>“Did you just call me a jerk and a damn bastard right now?”</p>
<p>Wow. That was a first—being cursed at in the middle of ravaging her. Jae-heon blinked, momentarily stunned. But what surprised him even more—</p>
<p>“Hm. That was kinda sexy. Say it again.”</p>
<p>“You freakin’… pervert… ah—!”</p>
<p>Oh hell. What was this? Did he have some strange condition where getting cursed at made him finish instantly?</p>
<p>Even as he paused in thought, still buried deep inside her, his length twitched and throbbed. Her words had triggered something primal, and he spilled into her again with a shudder.</p>
<p>“…Worse than Lee Yoon-geon…”</p>
<p>Oof.</p>
<p>She had just dropped the worst insult she knew. Worse than that guy. Crazier than him. More unhinged than him…</p>
<p>“Well… I guess I am more insane than Lee Yoon-geon,” Jae-heon muttered.</p>
<p>She wasn’t wrong, but it still stung. Being compared to that loser? Seriously?</p>
<p>Still, the sight of Goyo cursing with those tear-filled eyes was something else. Something intense.</p>
<p>And weirdly enough… being insulted like that made his body react before his brain could. His arousal surged again—stronger than any stimulant. His softened shaft, which had just been emptied, stiffened right back up as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“Come on. More. Swear at me again.”</p>
<p>“…Wh-what do you even want from me right now…?”</p>
<p>Goyo stared at him, dumbfounded, mouth slightly open. Jae-heon only shrugged, pushed in deeper, and began rotating his hips in slow, deliberate circles. He could feel her walls clenching tightly around him as he pulled out just far enough for the tip to catch at the edge—then slammed back in with a dull, heavy thud.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess you’re out of insults by now. Not like I’ve done anything wrong. I’ve been so sweet and gentle, haven’t I?”</p>
<p>He chuckled, a low hum in his throat, and started moving again. Thud. Slap. Thud-thud. The sounds of skin meeting skin grew louder, sharper, reaching a frenzied rhythm.</p>
<p>Watching himself lose control inside her like some berserker, Jae-heon had to admit the truth.</p>
<p>He’d developed a kink—for being cursed at by Lee Goyo.</p>
<p>With a final breath that blurred the line between a sigh and a moan, Goyo fainted.</p>
<p>“…Didn’t think it would go this far.”</p>
<p>The moment he first held her, Jae-heon had thought I could go all night with this woman. But he hadn’t expected to spiral into full-blown madness like this.</p>
<p>He hadn’t planned on spending several days doing nothing but enjoying each other. His original intention had been simple—just once or twice, then a good night’s sleep. Nothing more.</p>
<p>Not that anyone would believe me now.</p>
<p>“Ha… haah.”</p>
<p>A dry, breathy laugh escaped his lips.</p>
<p>Who would’ve thought lust could overpower the need to sleep? He wasn’t some wild animal, and yet here he was—still moving, still thrusting, as if he couldn’t stop himself.</p>
<p>“I’m really out of my mind.”</p>
<p>This kind of frenzied, obsessive passion was never part of his plan, and yet here they were. And he couldn’t blame anyone else for it.</p>
<p>“Guess I’m just a man after all.”</p>
