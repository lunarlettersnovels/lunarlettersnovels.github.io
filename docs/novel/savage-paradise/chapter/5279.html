            <p><strong>Chapter 44.1</strong></p>
<p>“Don’t get any ideas—I’m not doing this because I want kids.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s legs, which had been wrapped around Jae-heon’s waist, kept slipping. In response, Jae-heon lowered one of her legs to the floor, anchoring the other on his arm to keep her from escaping, and pressed her back against the entryway wall.</p>
<p>When Jae-heon thrust upward, the blunt tip struck deeper than before. Sparks exploded, and in an instant, the heat spread through her belly like wildfire.</p>
<p>“Ah… Aah, ah! Hh… ahh.”</p>
<p>Thud—bang—. The wall she was pressed against had a storage cabinet built in. Every time he drove himself into her with a heavy thrust, her back banged against the cabinet door.</p>
<p>But Goyo had no room to think about where she was standing or what her back was hitting. The fire ignited inside her was spreading through every nerve, and his large hand gripping her lower body made it impossible to focus on anything else.</p>
<p>“I already gave you my first time…”</p>
<p>Jae-heon lowered his head and gently bit her earlobe.</p>
<p>“You’re, you’re too fast… sl-slow… down… ahh…”</p>
<p>The thick, heavy column that felt like it could split her in two slowly pulled out, only to drive in again with force. Thud! Thud! Thud! Jae-heon’s hips moved with fierce intensity, and Goyo’s delicate body swayed helplessly, like a candle flickering in the wind.</p>
<p>“You know you’ll have to take responsibility for me now, right?”</p>
<p>There was a fierce possessiveness in his voice.</p>
<p>She couldn’t even handle herself—how was she supposed to be responsible for anyone else? Especially for someone like Kwon Jae-heon, who wielded power, wealth, and violence like it was nothing?</p>
<p>After sleeping around with countless women, now he insisted, “You’re the first I didn’t use a condom with, so you’ve taken my innocence.”</p>
<p>It was no different from that insane thing Lee Yoon-geon had once said after a messy night with someone else: “Goyo, my heart is still with you.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, what a load of b—! Ngh, aaah!”</p>
<p>Maybe because of the absurdity of what she’d just heard, the words slipped out without filter. In short, total nonsense.</p>
<p>“Did you just call me a son of a b<em>h? That’s not the kind of mouth I expected from my baby.”</em>*</p>
<p>Maybe her words triggered something, because Jae-heon’s thrusts grew rougher.</p>
<p>Thump! Thump! Thump! The thick, veined length pounded into her relentlessly, stirring her up with such force that her back banged repeatedly against the shoe cabinet, echoing in jerky thuds.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t—ahh, ngh…”</p>
<p>She hadn’t meant to curse—it had just come out. It was on par with Lee Yoon-geon claiming he was still a virgin because he hadn’t given his heart to the other woman.</p>
<p>“Think about it. Flesh on flesh—that’s what makes it real.”</p>
<p>“Haa… haah… hhh…”</p>
<p>Thud! Thud! Thud! His thrusts came so hard that her feet lifted off the ground. Her breath was ragged, her mind blank, and yet her hips moved on their own, syncing to his rhythm.</p>
<p>No matter how persistent someone is, you only believe them if what they say makes sense. Goyo scrunched her brows at Kwon Jae-heon’s absurd declarations, but he kept slamming into her like it was nothing.</p>
<p>“It’s in a man’s nature to want to make babies. But condoms? They get in the way. So when a guy goes in raw, it means, ‘I want to have your baby.’ That’s what you call courtship.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon spun his twisted logic mid-thrust, practically preaching his “no-condom equals love” theory.</p>
<p>There was no one as insane as this man. And yet, the fact that her own body responded to him made her feel just as unhinged.</p>
<p>“Hngh… ahh…”</p>
<p>Goyo instinctively clung to his neck, riding the waves of pleasure crashing into her—but she still couldn’t let his ridiculous claims slide.</p>
<p>“Haa… ah… Didn’t you say you got a vasectomy? You said you didn’t even want kids… ahh!”</p>
<p>It had barely been a few minutes since he said that. And now he was rambling about fatherhood being a man’s instinct?</p>
<p>“It’s just an expression. You really don’t get nuance, do you?”</p>
<p>He scolded her like a teacher to a slow student, narrowing his eyes as he looked down at her—then slammed his hips forward again. Her eyes fluttered and lifted slightly as he hit deep, prompting him to click his tongue.</p>
<p>“So cold.”</p>
<p>Still locking eyes with her, Jae-heon pulled back and then slammed in again. She could feel every inch of him pressing in, blunt and thick.</p>
<p>“Just accept it. My first time? I gave it to you, Miss Lee Goyo.”</p>
