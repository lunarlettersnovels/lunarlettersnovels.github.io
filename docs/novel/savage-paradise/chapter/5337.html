            <p><strong>Chapter 13.2</strong></p>
<p>“So. do you want to kill him? ” Despite his seventy years, Kwon Moo-young didn’t look his age, perhaps due to the herbal medicine he regularly took. He still had the stamina to easily knock down a few young guys in the gym.</p>
<p>Considering he could endure many more decades, was Lee Yi-taek planning to kill him outright? If Lee Yi-taek was thinking of killing Kwon Moo-young, it might be the most prudent option.</p>
<p>“Kill him?” Goyo was momentarily shocked but quickly regained her composure. She decided to turn the question cleverly. “Why? Would you kill him for me?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s eyes were half-closed, “Well… If it’s what you want, maybe?”</p>
<p>Now, his underneath was swelling beyond discomfort, nearing the brink of explosion. It wasn’t a matter of whether the old man would die but when he would burst.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know the President would accept a murder request.”</p>
<p>As someone who had witnessed the assault on Lee Yun-gun firsthand, Goyo didn’t take Jae-heon’s words about murder lightly. Despite South Korea being a nation governed by law, Jae-heon seemed like someone who lived outside its bounds.</p>
<p>Since that day, Lee Yoon-gun has remained hospitalized. His injuries were serious, but thankfully there were no broken bones or permanent damage. Even observing Lee Yoon-gun in this state, Lee Yi-taek, himself a former prosecutor, remarked, “President Kwon has been quite lenient.”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun caused quite a stir in the hospital, constantly ranting about how he would chew up Jae-heon’s bones every day, but aside from that, he was unable to do much at the moment.</p>
<p>“Damn it, if I become a prosecutor, I’ll tear that guy apart first.”</p>
<p>He muttered these words several times a day. It might have been an empty boast, but surprisingly, Lee Yoon-gun was a law school student. His father was also a prosecutor, and there were many lawyers among his relatives.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the ramblings of a lunatic; in a few years, it could become a reality. Every time Goyo heard Lee Yoon-gun’s threats, she shuddered.</p>
<p>“Becoming a prosecutor is such an attractive profession. You can either eliminate an existing crime or create a nonexistent one.”</p>
<p>Listening to Lee Yoon-gun’s praises of being a prosecutor was enough to give her a headache. It sounded sinister to say that even innocent people who displeased him could be turned into criminals and ruin their lives.</p>
<p>Even if he became a prosecutor, she couldn’t put Jae-heon in jail, but not everyone in the world was like Kwon Jae-heon. Above all, she hoped that Lee Yoon-gun would never become a prosecutor.</p>
<p>“You’re not asking me to … give you killer s*x, you’re asking me to kill a real person?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s gaze down at Goyo was chilling. Even though he was only looking at her, a shiver ran down her spine. His gaze seemed capable of killing someone with just a look.</p>
<p>“Who do you want to kill?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon asked incredulously. Was the reason he was visiting the old man to ask him to kill someone?</p>
<p>If there was someone he wanted dead, asking Kwon Moyoung for help would be the most sensible option. Kwon Moyoung could make anyone disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>“Whatever nonsense you’ve heard, it couldn’t have been about taking requests from a woman who’s only good for her face. Or could it? With a body like that, the compensation would be more than adequate.”</p>
<p>Thinking about how the old man would look at this woman made her feel dirty. It was back to square one.</p>
<p>“Your abilities aren’t enough to buy me.”</p>
<p>Impurities need to be cut off from the start.</p>
<p>“The compensation is quite high.”</p>
<p>“If it’s Yi-taek, even selling Goyo to Kwon Moo-young wouldn’t make him less of a man. Kwon Moyoung himself would trivialize murder if it’s for his woman.”</p>
<p>“Seems like it.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, if I refuse, you might ask someone else to kill.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s gaze towards Goyo was chilling.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know murder for hire was also a condition for winning the auction.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Just kidding. Who should I screw over?”</p>
<p>His gaze was intense, his voice serious.</p>
<p>If Goyo were to ask someone to be killed now, that person might end up in the morgue by the end of the night.</p>
<p>“N-No, I was just kidding.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t possibly be serious about wanting someone dead.</p>
<p>As the conversation took an odd turn, Goyo, flustered, mumbled vaguely. She couldn’t keep up with Jae-heon’s thinking. Of course, the same applied to Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“Oh, just kidding?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon tilted his head, staring quietly at Goyo. Then suddenly, he burst into laughter.</p>
<p>It was so unexpected that he couldn’t stop laughing. Tears formed in his eyes, and his laughter was so loud it hurt his lungs.</p>
