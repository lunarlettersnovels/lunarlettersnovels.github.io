        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 48.1</strong></p>
<p>It is said that a king of the Mughal Empire in India built a magnificent palace for his beloved queen. The golden pillars supporting the palace were adorned with a jewel that shone as brightly at night as it did during the day, proving the king’s love.”</p>
<p>Enjoying his audience, Yoon began to boast about the jewel more.</p>
<p>“This jewel is a ruby known as ‘Pigeon Blood,’ resembling the deep red color of a dove’s blood. It is said to be the most vivid and red ruby in existence.”</p>
<p>Due to the large ruby and the densely set diamonds, its price reached hundreds of millions of won. The rarity of the large Pigeon Blood itself made it a limited edition, so it was priced beyond the reach of common people. However, perhaps due to the drama’s popularity, inquiries for purchase were pouring in.</p>
<p>Since it was not the product he originally intended to buy and a more expensive item was already on its way to his home, Jae-heon didn’t even glance at the devil’s temptation.</p>
<p>Despite Jae-heon’s sullen expression, Yoon, who handled VVIP clients, maintained a business smile and continued speaking.</p>
<p>“This product was specially ordered by Executive Director Park Jeong-hoon of Seongjo Ilbo.”</p>
<p>“Park Jeong-hoon?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s eyes gleamed sharply.</p>
<p>Yoon was indeed seasoned. She mentioned the name Park Jeong-hoon because she knew that the beautiful woman sitting next to Kwon Jae-heon was the one Park Jeong-hoon had been pursuing.</p>
<p>Last weekend, Kwon Jae-heon spent 1 billion won at an auction to buy a necklace for the woman. Yoon was also there. He was one of the few who vividly witnessed the tense confrontation between Park Jeong-hoon and Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>The next day, Park Jeong-hoon inquired about purchasing the expensive jewel, including the “Devil’s Temptation.” It was a predictable development. So, when I casually mentioned Park Jeong-hoon’s name, Kwon Jae-heon’s expression changed, just as expected.</p>
<p>“It is said that there has never been a failed proposal with this jewel. That’s why it earned the nickname ‘Devil’s Temptation.’”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Since it’s a limited edition, it’s hard to secure, but I’m showing it to you first, Director Kwon.”</p>
<p>Yoon emphasized her point.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon smirked and straightened his posture.</p>
<p>“I like it.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon loosened his lips into a charming smile. That day, Yoon achieved the highest sales ever.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>December 31st, 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>In Lee Yi-taek’s office.</p>
<p>“What brings you here without an appointment?”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek frowned at the suddenly arrived Kwon Jae-heon. He was sitting on the office sofa with his legs crossed, as if it were his own home.</p>
<p>The end of the year is usually busy, but today, being the last day, there were even more events to attend than usual. Starting with a broadcast interview, he had to participate in the Bosingak bell-ringing ceremony in Jongno at midnight.</p>
<p>It was already annoying that Jae-heon barged into the office without making an appointment, but he was also fiddling with his phone as soon as he entered. Watching him busily typing messages twisted Lee Yi-taek’s stomach.</p>
<p>This is why young people…</p>
<p>“You seem very busy; how about making an appointment next time?”</p>
<p>“I can’t take up the time of someone as busy as you.”</p>
<p>Yet, he continued to play with his phone. The buzzing notification sound from incoming messages kept irritating Lee Yi-taek.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know Director Kwon was such a rude person.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek looked at Kwon Jae-heon with a displeased expression.</p>
<p>This is why family education is important; it’s clear what he learned from his poorly raised background, and that thought was evident on his face.</p>
<p>“I thought I had shown enough courtesy, but it seems I fell a bit short for you, Congressman.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon chuckled softly and placed his phone on the table. The pitch-black phone vibrated with a buzzing sound as soon as it touched the surface.</p>
<p>“I’ve been catching up on work since I took a few days off.”</p>
<p>“A few days? That’s an understatement.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek swallowed his rising anger as he spoke. Jae-heon had completely taken the product he had nurtured and had been holding onto it for days. Seeing that smug face, Lee Yi-taek could easily imagine how he had spent those days.</p>
<p>“Thanks to you, I did get some good rest.”</p>
<p>“Now that I see your face, when are you going to return my daughter?”</p>
