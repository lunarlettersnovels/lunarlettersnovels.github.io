            <p><strong>Chapter 42.1</strong></p>
<p>“Open your mouth. Let me in.”</p>
<p>Goyo parted her lips wide, taking him in deeper. Having done this once before, she had already picked up on the technique. Gripping his thighs for support, she pulled him in with firm suction.</p>
<p>“Damn… where did you even learn… hah.”</p>
<p>His reaction was markedly different this time. Goyo focused on the spots where he was most sensitive—licking, teasing, and tightening around him. Pressing her tongue against the tip, she trapped the shaft between her teeth and moved her head, all while cupping and kneading the firm weight below. She sucked deeply, her cheeks hollowing with each motion.</p>
<p>Her hands wrapped around the slickened length, following the rhythm of her movements. Each time her head bobbed, the firm heat pulsed against her palms, the taut muscles and veins vividly pressing against her skin.</p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>Jae-heon let out a breathy groan, his grip on her head tightening before he suddenly pulled away. His length slipped free from her mouth, and at the same moment, a heated release splashed against her face.</p>
<p>A warm, milky trail trickled down her skin, carrying a heady scent that filled her senses. Dazed, Goyo wiped her face with her hand, looking up at him in a daze.</p>
<p>Without thinking, she instinctively flicked her tongue out, tasting the lingering traces on her lips. The unfamiliar intensity made her mind spin.</p>
<p>“…That was insane.”</p>
<p>A deep rumble rose from Jae-heon’s throat. The sight of Goyo, her hair and cheeks smeared with the remnants of his release, sent a slow heat crawling up from his core.</p>
<p>With a quiet chuckle, he murmured, “I think I’m developing a thing for entrances.”</p>
<p>His lips curled into a smirk as he wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her upright. His breath, warm and heavy, lingered in the small space between them.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you already?” Goyo exhaled, her voice carrying the barest hint of amusement.</p>
<p>His smirk widened. “Imagine that—getting worked up every time I walk through the door.”</p>
<p>Lowering his gaze, he traced slow fingers over the shell of her ear, his voice low and teasing, enough to send a shiver down her spine.</p>
<p>“Do you know how many suits I’ve ruined because of you?”</p>
<p>Despite the supposed complaint, satisfaction glimmered in his expression.</p>
<p>Even now, barely concealed beneath his unbuttoned clothes, he showed no signs of calming. A lingering drop traced its way down, making Goyo’s breath hitch ever so slightly.</p>
<p>“I thought that was just your preference,” she muttered.</p>
<p>Given how often he only bothered to loosen his clothes rather than remove them entirely, she had assumed he enjoyed the contrast.</p>
<p>He let out a quiet hum. “Not yours? Meeting a man at the door like this?”</p>
<p>“That’s… not a hobby I have,” she retorted firmly.</p>
<p>Who would even have a habit like that?</p>
<p>Jae-heon merely shrugged, as if unconvinced, his expression unreadable yet amused.</p>
<p>“Baby, don’t be shy. I don’t mind ruining a suit every day for this.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>The idea of discarding a luxury suit after every time they were together was ridiculous. Sending it for dry cleaning covered in evidence of their night? Embarrassing. But knowing Kwon Jae-heon, he probably wouldn’t care. She still couldn’t tell if he was joking or serious.</p>
<p>He gave her a sly, knowing smile.</p>
<p>“I have plenty of suits.”</p>
<p>His gaze darkened with mischief.</p>
<p>“But I can’t be the only one having fun. Should I return the favor?”</p>
<p>“A-ah, no. I’m f-fine… ah—”</p>
<p>Before she could react, her scarf was whisked away. In the blink of an eye, her stockings and underwear slid down, pooling onto the cold floor.</p>
<p>She barely had time to process the sudden exposure before his hands were already trailing over her skin, his fingers tracing the heat between her thighs.</p>
<p>“You’re already this worked up? I didn’t even do anything yet.”</p>
<p>His voice was low, teasing, as he slipped his fingers against her, testing her reaction.</p>
<p>“Ahn… ahh…”</p>
<p>A soft gasp escaped her lips at the sudden touch. One finger became two, then three, moving with deliberate ease. The sound of it was enough to make her tremble.</p>
<p>“We should… move to the living room… please,” she pleaded, her breath hitching.</p>
<p>He chuckled, his fingers lingering as he pressed closer.</p>
<p>“You’re so sensitive. Just a little touch and you’re already like this.”</p>
<p>“T-That’s not… true,” she protested weakly, her body betraying her words.</p>
<p>“You seem impatient. Should I just give you what you want?”</p>
<p>“N-no, stop.”</p>
<p>Something about this felt overwhelming, too much.</p>
<p>“Not here. I don’t want it like this.”</p>
<p>She should have pushed through the entryway, straight to the living room the moment she stepped inside.</p>
<p>“Please, let’s go inside.”</p>
<p>It didn’t matter whose preference it was—this couldn’t become a habit.</p>
<p>“Jae-heon, inside. Now.”</p>
<p>“You think you’re on equal footing with me just because of that?”</p>
