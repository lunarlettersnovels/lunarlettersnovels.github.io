            <p><strong>Chapter 32.1</strong></p>
<p>C-CEO, how did you get here…?”</p>
<p>Lee Goyo stared at Jae-heon with eyes full of shock, as if saying, “Why are you here?” She never imagined she’d run into Kwon Jae-heon at a coffee shop that required reservations months in advance, so her reaction was raw and unfiltered.</p>
<p>“…How did you get in?”</p>
<p>Goyo pinched her arm, wondering if she was seeing things. The spot she pinched hurt enough to make her regret her childish behavior.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s eyes narrowed, as if he didn’t like Goyo’s reaction.</p>
<p>“That’s all you’re curious about? Do you think there’s a place I can’t go?”</p>
<p>Goyo shook her head at his question. It was said that all the shady money in Korea moved through his hands. There was no way Kwon Jae-heon couldn’t get in here just because he didn’t have a reservation. It was a foolish and stupid question.</p>
<p>“Then what are you doing here? All dressed up like this?”</p>
<p>The woman he’d held in his arms and kissed all weekend was with another man after only half a day. Kwon Jae-heon’s eyes shone brightly, like a man who had just caught his lover cheating.</p>
<p>“Baby, I’m asking you a question.”</p>
<p>Thump. Jae-heon sat down next to Goyo without asking for permission or consent. The twitch in his sharp jaw suggested he was gathering all his willpower. As if telling her to say something, anything, Jae-heon stared intently at Goyo’s face, which was facing forward.</p>
<p>It was Park Jung-hoon who finally spoke.</p>
<p>“…Baby?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon, sitting across from her, gaped in disbelief. But Kwon Jae-heon didn’t care about Park Jung-hoon’s reaction from the start.</p>
<p>“Is it because your oppa isn’t asking nicely? Then I’ll ask again.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon rested his chin on his hand and looked at her with a deep gaze.</p>
<p>“Crazy… O-oppa?</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon rubbed his arms with his hands as if he had goosebumps, and furrowed his brow. Kwon Jae-heon’s eyes slid towards him, as if Park Jung-hoon’s continuous interjections were annoying.</p>
<p>Would he be quiet if I crushed his neck?</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon shut his mouth at Kwon Jae-heon’s chilling gaze. Then, Kwon Jae-heon’s eyes turned back to Goyo.</p>
<p>“Goyo, why didn’t you answer oppa’s call?”</p>
<p>Tap, tap. Jae-heon lightly tapped the table with the corner of his phone. Startled by the sound, Goyo bit her lower lip.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s eyes narrowed as he looked at Goyo. The corners of his eyes drew a soft curve, but he still looked uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Goyo knew how she must look to Jae-heon without having to hear it.</p>
<p>‘A re-auction.’</p>
<p>This was a place to take back the item he’d sent and show it off to Park Jung-hoon.</p>
<p>However, Park Jung-hoon was just one of many auction participants. Whether Park Jung-hoon would be the final bidder, or whether a third party would suddenly appear, depended solely on Lee Yi-taek’s decision.</p>
<p>In the meantime, many people had asked Lee Yi-taek to introduce them to Goyo. It was enough for Goyo to hear about it, which meant that quite a few people wanted her.</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek was probably still calculating, trying to raise her price.</p>
<p>“Go on, make an excuse.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon tilted his head and rested his chin on his hand. His lips were definitely stretched into a languid smile, but he didn’t look like he was smiling at all.</p>
<p>“I’m running out of patience and is about to get angry, do I have to wait any longer?”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>Her pride wouldn’t let her say that she seemed to be back on the auction block. Kwon Jae-heon knew that she was treated like a doll and a dog by the Lee Yi-taek and his son, but she didn’t want to say it herself.</p>
<p>“I gave you plenty of time to make an excuse. I’ll listen, so just say anything, okay?”</p>
<p>His languid voice flowed into her ear. It was a situation that could be misunderstood, but it wasn’t her fault. She had no choice but to avoid his call, but telling the truth wasn’t necessarily the best course of action either.</p>
<p>“I don’t usually answer numbers I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know my number?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon looked surprised that she didn’t know his phone number.</p>
<p>“You didn’t give it to me.”</p>
<p>“…Was it?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>All they’d done was have sex. He hadn’t said a single word about himself. Neither had Goyo. Besides bodily fluids, all that had passed between them were names that everyone knew.</p>
<p>That seemed to get her past the question of why she hadn’t answered the phone. The second question was why she was here…</p>
<p>There was no need to lie. She could just tell the truth. It was just that she didn’t know if Lee Yi-taek would like it.</p>
<p>Goyo took a moment to gather her breath and then opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Congressman is very angry that you beat Yoon-gun oppa so badly.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“Congressman told me to meet Executive Director Park, so I came.”</p>
<p>“That’s all?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon beat Lee Yoon-gun, so Lee Yi-taek was angry. So he was testing the waters, trying to pass the item he’d promised to Kwon Jae-heon to someone else. It was a simple but clear reason.</p>
<p>“You didn’t come here of your own free will?”</p>
<p>“…..No.”</p>
