            <p><strong>Chapter 26.2</strong></p>
<p>Since being taken in by Lee Yi-taek and starting to live with Yoon-gun, her life had been submerged in an abyss. So deep and dark that not even a inch ahead was visible. She could only hope this hellish time would pass.</p>
<p>Goyo simply bit her lower lip and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Damn! Damn it!”</p>
<p>His harsh curse was followed by an abrupt stop to the sounds of flesh.</p>
<p>Is it over now? As silence continued, Goyo painfully lifted her eyelids.</p>
<p>“Hup…!”</p>
<p>Right in front of her, Yoon-gun was staring at her with wildly rolling eyes. Goyo inhaled sharply and quickly turned her head.</p>
<p>Yoon-gun stood before her completely naked. Below his waist, his partially erect member twitched grotesquely. Though she had seen him naked before, never like this. The intense scent of bodily fluids made her stomach churn.</p>
<p>“Not just wagging your tail… you rolled around too? Damn it, try saying no.”</p>
<p>His expression twisted menacingly. Yoon-gun’s rough hand immediately dug into the back of her head.</p>
<p>“Yoon-gun oppa, let go and talk.”</p>
<p>A voice as quiet as it was calm flowed from Goyo’s lips.</p>
<p>“Your girlfriend might be surprised.”</p>
<p>Goyo gazed at the hospital room with indifferent eyes.</p>
<p>On the bed, a woman with disheveled hair pulled the sheet up to her chest, looking bewildered as she watched the two of them.</p>
<p>Yoon-gun, however, paid the woman no attention.</p>
<p>“Damn it, Lee Goyo!”</p>
<p>“…Put on some clothes.”</p>
<p>She opened her mouth, suppressing her nausea.</p>
<p>“Goyo, I won’t get too angry. Just tell me.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>It felt like a large thorn was stuck in her throat.</p>
<p>“Which bastard did you spread your legs for?”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun gripped her hair roughly, matching her eye level. Her head was helplessly tilted back. His rolling eyes were chilling.</p>
<p>“Oppa, I don’t understand what you’re saying.”</p>
<p>“Now you’re lying too. Goyo, you’re reeking of sexual fluids. Are you trying to drive me crazy?”</p>
<p>His voice, filled with disgust, poured over her face.</p>
<p>You’re interrogating me? When you were just thrusting into another woman?</p>
<p>“…It hurts.”</p>
<p>Feeling like her scalp might tear, Goyo grabbed Yoon-gun’s arm. Disregarding her, he dragged her by the hair into the hospital room.</p>
<p>“I’m asking you. Which bastard’s sexual fluids did you take! Damn, talking about charity events and collapsing. Everyone was too busy looking at you. Like a prostitute, all dressed up, who did you seduce!”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun’s eyes, wide open, were turning blood-red with burst blood vessels.</p>
<p>“Please, stop.”</p>
<p>“Damn!”</p>
<p>With a sharp, dull impact sound, Goyo’s face turned. Before the burning pain could subside, another spark flew across her cheek. Her body swayed and tilted to one side.</p>
<p>“Speak! Tell me!”</p>
<p>“What would change if I told you?”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun didn’t know the details of what happened at the charity event and auction. Lee Yi-taek had clearly blocked the information. If he had known, he would have rushed out of the hospital to the hotel.</p>
<p>“I told you to only look at me! I said I’d gouge out your eyes if you look at another guy!”</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun’s pathological obsession exhausted Goyo. This was far from normal behavior.</p>
<p>“I told you to manage your body well!”</p>
<p>Slap- smack-. His rough palm repeatedly struck her cheek.</p>
<p>He claimed it was romance when he did it, but adultery when others did – the ultimate hypocrisy. He had been constantly meeting women since his underage years. Some women even came claiming pregnancy.</p>
<p>While he played so disgustingly, he extremely disliked Goyo being with other men.</p>
<p>“I’m the one who saved you from that wretched place. I’m the one who brought you here. Why don’t you know your place, Goyo? You should be loyal to me. You’re not father’s dog, you’re MY dog!”</p>
<p>“How could I defy the Congressman? Even you can’t do that.”</p>
<p>Goyo let out a bitter laugh, overwhelmed.</p>
