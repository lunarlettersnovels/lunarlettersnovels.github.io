            <p><strong>Chapter 44.2</strong></p>
<p>Every time he moved, the thick ridge of him dragged roughly along her inner walls. The veined shaft was slick and soaked from how much she was aroused.</p>
<p>“Haah… You’re even… worse than Lee Yoon-geon… I’ve never met anyone like you… ngh, ahh!”</p>
<p>She thought she’d never meet someone more insane than Yoon-geon.</p>
<p>“I was just a frog in a well.”</p>
<p>These past few days had taught her one thing for sure: the world was vast—and full of psychos.</p>
<p>“Is that a compliment?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon did whatever he pleased. His tone brimmed with confidence, and his thrusts were relentless.</p>
<p>His clothes remained perfectly in place, save for the front of his pants, which were undone just enough to free himself as he pounded into her. Every time the expensive fabric brushed her skin, the cool sensation made her shiver.</p>
<p>“…Ugh.”</p>
<p>As if that could be a compliment. He was completely out of line.</p>
<p>Every time the thick shaft slid in and out of her soaking entrance, it made a slick, wet sound. Her fluids gushed out, sticky and uncontrollable.</p>
<p>“It’s too deep… ugh.”</p>
<p>“Here, huh.”</p>
<p>The corners of Jae-heon’s eyes curled in amusement as he pressed even closer, pushing deeper inside her.</p>
<p>“Here too?”</p>
<p>He slowly rotated his hips, digging into her from different angles while gripping her ass tightly. Every time the brutal shaft dragged at her clinging pink flesh, Goyo trembled from head to toe.</p>
<p>“Uhh… ngh, mm…”</p>
<p>“Your sweet spot’s pretty deep. No way a small d*ck could satisfy you.”</p>
<p>His languid voice curled around her ear. Drenched in pleasure, his tone made her even more flushed.</p>
<p>“No way a few thrusts would stretch you out.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon, eyes glazed with heat, rocked his hardened shaft inside her, slowly, deeply. Wet, obscene sounds spilled out with every move.</p>
<p>“Ahh… haah… ngh…”</p>
<p>“If you’re gonna get used to my size, I’ll have to do this every day, yeah?”</p>
<p>He pressed his lips softly to her forehead as he whispered. The voice was gentle—but the blazing look in his eyes was anything but. He looked like a beast.</p>
<p>“Ahh… y-you said I was just a one-night stand.”</p>
<p>Even one time felt overwhelming. Her whole body was burning up, and she couldn’t breathe properly.</p>
<p>Goyo was bothered by how foreign her own breathy moans sounded, leaking out between her clenched teeth.</p>
<p>“Pfft, but isn’t that what you want too?”</p>
<p>A short sigh escaped from Jae-heon’s lips.</p>
<p>“Don’t run away tonight. Let me sleep in peace.”</p>
<p>His voice rang faintly, echoing in her ears. Their eyes met.</p>
<p>Her face was reflected in his dark pupils, deep as the night sky. Goyo felt unfamiliar with the image of herself consumed by pleasure in his gaze.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be more peaceful if no one was around?”</p>
<p>Goyo reached out and wrapped her arms around his neck, burying her face against him. She couldn’t bear to look at herself any longer.</p>
<p>Her body kept trembling from his thick, veiny shaft lodged deep inside her. Her insides, excited just by the thought of being filled, kept twitching impatiently.</p>
<p>Had she come to enjoy this? Goyo’s thoughts tangled in confusion.</p>
<p>“True, I can’t sleep when someone’s there.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon gripped her ass tightly and pressed their hips flush together. Her clit and inner walls were crushed all at once.</p>
<p>“But it’s strange. I can’t sleep when someone’s around…”</p>
<p>His drowsy voice trailed off as he started moving again.</p>
<p>His shaft, pulling out with a drag against her walls, thrust back in roughly as if it belonged there. Her wet, clenching insides clamped down as though never wanting to let him go. As if those repeated partings and reunions were tragic, her pussy kept gushing juices around his cock.</p>
<p>“Haah… ahhh… mmm.”</p>
<p>Goyo buried her face deeper into his shoulder, breath heavy and damp.</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s thrusts grew rougher. He rammed in to the base without giving her a moment to catch her breath.</p>
<p>Pulling nearly all the way out to the tip, he slammed back in like he meant to shove it all the way to his balls. Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Each upward thrust from below left her insides a ruined mess.</p>
<p>“But when I’m holding you, I sleep really well.”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s… ahhk… just b-because we’re doing it so much… ahn…”</p>
<p>Even the worst insomniac would probably pass out after nonstop s*x till dawn, wouldn’t they?</p>
