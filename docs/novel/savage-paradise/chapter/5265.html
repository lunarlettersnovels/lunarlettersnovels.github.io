            <p><strong>Chapter 51.1</strong></p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Despite Park Seo-hwa’s strong protest, the bodyguards remained unmoved.</p>
<p>“Is this how it’s going to be? I have no choice but to call your boss and tell him that I can’t work with you because you’re making me feel uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>The bodyguards exchanged glances at Park Seo-hwa’s ambiguous wording. It sounded like she was involved in something with Kwon Jae-heon, but since they hadn’t heard anything specific, they couldn’t back down easily.</p>
<p>“Do you still not believe me?”</p>
<p>With a faint smile, Park Seo-hwa took out her phone in front of them. She pressed the call button and showed them the screen that read ‘KJ Financial CEO Kwon Jae-heon.’</p>
<p>Ding ding, ding-. As the call waiting tone rang, the expressions of the bodyguards gradually hardened.</p>
<p>“Just a moment…”</p>
<p>—Hello…?</p>
<p>As a blunt male voice came through the receiver, she abruptly pressed the end call button. The bodyguards’ faces showed a mix of surprise and relief upon hearing the familiar voice.</p>
<p>“Leave now; I won’t give you a second chance.”</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa pointed to the door again with her finger. The bodyguards, seeing no other option, lightly bowed their heads and exited the waiting room, standing guard outside. Their presence just outside the door seemed to threaten that they would rush in and subdue anyone who dared to harm Goyo.</p>
<p>“This feels really dirty. I hate being watched; I don’t even bring my secretary with me. This place isn’t going to work for me anymore. I didn’t pay for an expensive membership to be treated like this.”</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry. It’s because of me.”</p>
<p>Goyo felt out of place, knowing this was all happening because of her.</p>
<p>Cheongdam J was a beauty salon frequented by the top 1% of society. She had likely spent a lot of money to receive the best service, so it was understandable that Park Seo-hwa was in a bad mood.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t talking to you, Goyo. I was just saying something to those men who are unnecessarily posing and making a fuss, so don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa smiled at Goyo as if to say she hadn’t created a tense atmosphere at all.</p>
<p>“Oh, okay.”</p>
<p>“Would you like to have a cup of coffee?”</p>
<p>Seeing Goyo staring blankly at her, Park Seo-hwa pointed to the wall. There was a coffee machine there. Perhaps it was prepared for waiting guests, as there were various tea bags alongside snacks like cookies and candies.</p>
<p>“If you don’t like coffee, there’s tea too.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine with anything.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll make coffee. The coffee here is quite good.”</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa went to the coffee machine and pressed a button. The sound of grinding beans filled the air, and soon the waiting room was filled with the fragrant aroma of coffee.</p>
<p>She prepared another cup of coffee, holding one cup in each hand as she approached the sofa. She placed one cup in front of Goyo and sat down in the seat opposite her.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Goyo fidgeted with the mug, timidly mumbling. Since Park Seo-hwa had poured her coffee, it felt rude not to take a sip, so she took a small drink. It had a slight sourness but wasn’t bad. Just as Park Seo-hwa had said, it was drinkable.</p>
<p>“Does it suit your taste? It’s okay, but it’s not as good as the coffee from Taehan Hotel.”</p>
<p>“It’s delicious.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear that.”</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa crossed her legs and smiled warmly.</p>
<p>“Were you a member here too, Goyo? I’ve been coming here for quite a while, but this is the first time I’ve seen you.”</p>
<p>“I’m here for the first time today.”</p>
<p>“I see. If I had known you were coming here, our Jeong-hoon would have chased after you with all his might. He’s really unlucky.”</p>
<p>Only then did she take a sip of her coffee. Goyo had felt before that Park Seo-hwa looked quite elegant while drinking coffee. Perhaps enjoying Goyo’s gaze, Park Seo-hwa smiled wider as she set her coffee cup down on the table.</p>
<p>“It seems Director Kwon is treating you well.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“It’s no surprise that Director Kwon has fallen in love. My brother is a bit of a fool and gives everything to women, but I didn’t think Kwon Jae-heon would be like that.”</p>
<p>Her gaze lightly swept over Goyo. The clothes she was wearing had all been chosen by Jae-heon that morning, making her feel a bit self-conscious. However, she hadn’t worn anything too extravagant out of stubbornness.</p>
<p>She had left her expensive bag in the car because it felt burdensome. Although the clothes she was wearing were expensive, they seemed less luxurious compared to what Park Seo-hwa was wearing.</p>
