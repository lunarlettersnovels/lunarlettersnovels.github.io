            <p><strong>Chapter 57.2</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, Goyo was too curious to let him go.</p>
<p>Why did the man hide the fact that he was a prosecutor from her? What did he mean by saying it wasn’t the right time to talk? What significance did it hold that he was investigating the kidnapping case from 14 years ago while telling her not to trust Yi-taek?</p>
<p>She had a million questions she wanted to ask right now, but the man only left her with questions without answers.</p>
<p>“Congressman is worried that he hasn’t been able to contact his daughter, so please send her home.”</p>
<p>“That’s not something for you to concern yourself with, Prosecutor.”</p>
<p>“Confinement is a crime.”</p>
<p>Ma Soon-jin openly attacked Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“A grown woman voluntarily staying with her boyfriend is called a relationship. Living together isn’t confinement; it’s cohabitation. The term ‘crime’ is used when someone illegally intrudes into my building, like you, Prosecutor.”</p>
<p>“Surrounded by bodyguards and not even able to make phone calls, and you call that voluntary…”</p>
<p>“I have to protect my woman.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon skillfully handled Ma Soon-jin’s provocation without falling for it.</p>
<p>“Protection, huh…”</p>
<p>The man trailed off, taking in the sight of the bodyguards. As Jae-heon and Ma Soon-jin argued, large bodyguards in black suits appeared.</p>
<p>“But seeing a rat scurrying around, it seems the security is still lacking.”</p>
<p>Ma Soon-jin was not on the guest list. He must have brought an invitation that was sent to someone else. It was puzzling why he had entered the enemy territory alone, where no one was there to welcome him.</p>
<p>Was his target Goyo or me?</p>
<p>Ma Soon-jin was a very famous prosecutor within the prosecution office, enough for Jae-heon to know his name. He was also quite persistent. Jae-heon was provoking him by casually calling him a rat. Although Ma Soon-jin’s face twitched, he didn’t seem angry.</p>
<p>The tension between the two men, both trying to take control, was palpable. Goyo felt her mouth go dry as she watched.</p>
<p>Her mind was racing with the words Ma Soon-jin had said. The most pressing question was:</p>
<p>‘Is he an ally or an enemy?’</p>
<p>Goyo’s eyes caught sight of the clutch bag she had placed on the table. Through a gap that hadn’t been fully closed, she could see the paper the man had slipped inside. She couldn’t tell if he was an ally or an enemy at that moment.</p>
<p>Her contemplation was brief. Goyo pulled the bag closer and pushed the paper deep inside with her fingers. Whether she would contact him later was a matter for another time.</p>
<p>Jae-heon, who had his back to her, didn’t notice, but it seemed Ma Soon-jin, standing across from her, had seen Goyo’s actions. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.</p>
<p>“Calling me a rat is disappointing. I’m also a duly invited guest, you know.”</p>
<p>Having achieved his intended purpose, Ma Soon-jin appeared more relaxed. He took out the invitation he had kept in his pocket and waved it in front of Jae-heon’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Since you’re a guest, enjoy the banquet like a guest, Prosecutor Ma Soon-jin.”</p>
<p>“That’s the plan. There’s plenty to eat and see, so I intend to take my time looking around.”</p>
<p>“Suit yourself.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon furrowed his brow and plopped down next to Goyo. He draped one arm around her shoulders and pulled her close. With his other hand, he picked up a wine bottle and filled her glass, pouring until it sloshed over the rim.</p>
<p>“I was looking for you because I couldn’t see you.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>The wine, shimmering at the edge of the glass, was a dazzling red.</p>
<p>“I was about to go inside…”</p>
<p>‘If that man hadn’t shown up.’</p>
<p>Goyo mumbled, glancing at Prosecutor Ma Soon-jin.</p>
<p>“I told you not to walk around alone; it’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>As Goyo’s gaze shifted to Ma Soon-jin, Jae-heon’s previously restrained mood twisted again. He tightened his grip around her shoulders, his arm muscles tensing. Goyo’s shoulders shrank slightly under his hold. When she trembled a bit, one of Jae-heon’s eyebrows shot up.</p>
<p>“If you stray from my sight, bugs will swarm around you.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon raised his eyebrows playfully and chuckled. Ma Soon-jin watched the two with his arms crossed.</p>
<p>“It seems you like it here, Prosecutor. Should we change our seats?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon lazily pressed his lips against Goyo’s forehead as he spoke. It was an action that could easily be mistaken for that of a loving couple.</p>
<p>“The night view from my office is amazing. Shall we go up?”</p>
<p>‘Let’s enjoy the night view together.’</p>
<p>Jae-heon leaned in and whispered in Goyo’s ear.</p>
<p>“What… are we going to do?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Goyo’s expression stiffened. She narrowed her eyes, asking with a sense of disbelief. No matter how obsessed Kwon Jae-heon was with sex, she never thought he would suddenly suggest it in front of others.</p>
<p>But Kwon Jae-heon was someone who existed beyond the bounds of common sense.</p>
<p>“What do you think? Ah, now that I think about it… I’m hard.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon whispered sticky words into Goyo’s ear, his warm breath brushing against her skin. Though he spoke in a hushed tone, it was loud enough for Ma Soon-jin, standing right in front of them, to hear.</p>
