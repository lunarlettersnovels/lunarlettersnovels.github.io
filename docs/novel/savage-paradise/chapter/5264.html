            <p><strong>Chapter 51.2</strong></p>
<p>“About the watch.”</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa pointed to the watch on Goyo’s wrist. Goyo squinted as she looked at the watch. It was one of Jae-heon’s possessions, and when she admired its beautiful design, he had snapped it onto her wrist.</p>
<p>“You received it without knowing? That brand starts at a minimum of 100 million won. Moreover, that model looks like a handmade piece.”</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa chuckled, saying that if it was a product specially ordered from a watchmaker, it was likely the only one in the world. She added that it was priceless.</p>
<p>Given Park Seo-hwa’s sophisticated appearance, it was clear she was knowledgeable about luxury goods. However, Goyo hadn’t expected her to know so much about men’s watches.</p>
<p>“It’s not a gift. He just put it on me.”</p>
<p>The watch he usually wore was leather, not metal. Although the design was unique, she thought it wouldn’t be more expensive than metal.</p>
<p>But at least 100 million won?</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon wouldn’t own a mundane product, but why was the watch so expensive? No, more importantly, Jae-heon had even made a new hole in the leather because it didn’t fit her wrist…</p>
<p>‘Ah, Kwon Jae-heon. What kind of expensive item have you damaged?’</p>
<p>Goyo found herself unconsciously fiddling with the watch on her wrist. Her body instinctively shrank back.</p>
<p>Then she suddenly realized, why was she fidgeting like a criminal when she hadn’t done anything wrong?</p>
<p>Having heard so many times that she was a parasite living off Lee Yi-taek and a brainless fool living thoughtlessly, the habit of submission had become ingrained in her.</p>
<p>Today, she couldn’t even defend herself against such remarks. Her gaze naturally fell downward.</p>
<p>When she had her first s*x with Kwon Jae-heon, she received a necklace worth 1 billion won. Since then, the countless times they had intertwined their bodies had resulted in her being adorned with money she could never earn in her lifetime.</p>
<p>However, all Goyo wanted was peace.</p>
<p>She had endured being a dog for the Yi-taek family and tolerated violence because she wanted to live quietly. Of course, she had some desires.</p>
<p>To have them give up on her. To graduate from university safely and find a job. To build a family with the man she loved and live a normal life. Was that possible?</p>
<p>“You’re cute, Goyo. While others are eager to get more, why are you so down about something that’s not a big deal?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m just…”</p>
<p>A one-of-a-kind handmade item couldn’t be nothing special. Was it possible that receiving gifts from a man in exchange for s*x wasn’t a big deal?</p>
<p>“I understand why everyone is so eager to give.”</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa muttered as she pulled a wallet from her handbag. Then, unexpectedly, she handed Goyo a business card.</p>
<p>“Here’s my number, Goyo.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Goyo blinked as she looked at the business card.</p>
<p>[Seongjo Daily</p>
<p>Executive Director Park Seo-hwa</p>
<p>010-XXXX-XXXX]</p>
<p>It was a simple business card with just her name and number written on white paper, but Goyo couldn’t bring herself to accept it. She didn’t understand why Park Seo-hwa was giving her the card.</p>
<p>“I thought you might feel uncomfortable if I asked for your number. So I’m entering my number instead.”</p>
<p>Goyo hesitated even to accept a single business card. Seeing her hesitation, Park Seo-hwa tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Is it that you can’t even accept my number?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not that.”</p>
<p>Receiving the business card wasn’t the issue. Every time a new phone number was added, it felt like an additional burden was placed on her.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon hadn’t just given her a new phone for free either.</p>
<p>‘It’s better to answer my phone before it rings three times.’</p>
<p>‘Three times is a bit much…’</p>
<p>‘Is that a difficult request? There shouldn’t be a reason not to answer.’</p>
<p>Both Yi-taek and Yoon-gun would make a fuss if she took too long to answer their calls. Knowing someone’s phone number came with a certain obligation and interference.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing serious. Just contact me if Park Jeong-hoon bothers or harasses you. I’ll take care of him; he’s not a bad guy, but if he gets involved with Kwon Jae-heon, he loses his mind. Director Kwon doesn’t even pay him any mind, but he’s got this rivalry in his head, and it gives me a headache.”</p>
<p>“…I didn’t know that.”</p>
<p>“Goyo, he won’t give up easily. He impulsively got married, you know. He was so obsessed with stealing Kwon Jae-heon’s woman… With the first button fastened wrong, how could he live properly?”</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa mentioned Park Jeong-hoon’s ex-wife, Kang Gyu-ri, who was also Kwon Jae-heon’s former fiancée. Just from the brief mention, it seemed there was a complicated story between them.</p>
<p>“It seems uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“Is there any reason for me to feel uncomfortable?”</p>
<p>She denied it, but Goyo’s stiff expression and bitter tone spoke volumes about her feelings.</p>
<p>“Talking about an ex of a lover is always uncomfortable. I shouldn’t have brought it up.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I genuinely mean it when I say to contact me if Jeong-hoon bothers you. He has a more persistent nature than he seems, so he won’t back down quietly.”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>After saying all that, she couldn’t refuse to take the business card.</p>
