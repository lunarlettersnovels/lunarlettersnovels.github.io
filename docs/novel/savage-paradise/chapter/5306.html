            <p><strong>Chapter 30.2</strong></p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I asked who it is.”</p>
<p>Goyo had been staring at the phone screen and missed what Lee Yi-taek said. She snapped back to reality at his displeased expression and tone, and quickly made an excuse.</p>
<p>“It’s a spam call.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t sure yet if it was Kwon Jae-heon’s call, but either way, it seemed best to keep it from Lee Yi-taek. Goyo quietly pressed the decline button. Thankfully, unlike Lee Yoon-gun, the phone didn’t immediately ring again.</p>
<p>“Having a son who only brings shame to his father’s name.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek’s unpleasant voice continued.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Since it was a violent incident that occurred in a major hospital, it wouldn’t be easy to quietly cover it up. If the media caught wind of it and started digging around, the truth would spread in an instant. So Lee Yi-taek was at the hospital from the morning to keep things quiet.</p>
<p>“Having a daughter who doesn’t behave properly is also troublesome.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“A woman of marriageable age going in and out of a hotel with a man.”</p>
<p>“…Th-that’s because you…”</p>
<p>It wasn’t something someone who had told her to become Kwon Jae-heon’s dog should say. She knew she could never satisfy him, but it felt unfair to be criticized like this.</p>
<p>“You’re getting disrespectful. Since when do you talk back to me?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Goyo bit down on her lower lip.</p>
<p>He’d told her to seduce Kwon Jae-heon by any means necessary. Now, he was changing his tune as easily as flipping his hand, just because he didn’t like the result. She didn’t know if it was because he was a politician, since she hadn’t met that many people in her life.</p>
<p>“I told you to behave properly, tsk.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek kept clicking his tongue. Since he didn’t like the outcome, he blamed her for everything. Just like always.</p>
<p>It had been 14 years since Goyo started living with Lee Yi-taek.</p>
<p>Even at the young age of six, Goyo knew her place. People told her she was lucky. But she hadn’t had a single day of peace since she’d come under Lee Yi-taek’s roof.</p>
<p>Afraid of being a stain on Lee Yi-taek’s reputation, Goyo always dressed neatly and carefully chose her words. She worked her fingers to the bone, terrified of being seen as an obstacle to Lee Yi-taek’s successful future.</p>
<p>To get into Korea University, Lee Yi-taek’s alma mater, she slept only three or four hours a day. Unlike Lee Yoon-gun, who easily got into Korea University thanks to his parents’ good genes, Goyo had to give it her all.</p>
<p>In the end, Goyo was able to enter Korea University thanks to her tireless efforts. But praise wasn’t for her.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, Executive Director Park seems to like you very much.”</p>
<p>The man who had said he fell in love with her at first sight at the auction.</p>
<p>“Father, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Are you planning to stay hospitalized forever?”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek looked at Goyo and spoke coldly. He was saying that she should be discharged now, implying that she was only hospitalized for a few slaps.</p>
<p>“I’m okay now.”</p>
<p>Goyo pulled out the IV needle and got up from the bed. Blood gushed from the forcibly removed needle hole, but she didn’t even have time to wipe it before her head started spinning.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>‘I wish I hadn’t woken up at all.’</p>
<p>“Taehan Hotel, 2 PM. I’ve made an appointment with Park Jung-hoon, Executive Director of Sungjo Daily.”</p>
<p>Even though he saw Goyo go up to the hotel with Kwon Jae-heon, Park Jung-hoon was trying to meet her again. And using a method she could never refuse.</p>
<p>“Unlike CEO Kwon, Executive Director Park comes from a prestigious family. Even though he’s divorced, he’s not a man you can dare to ignore.”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon was the next best option after Kwon Jae-heon. What promises did Lee Yi-taek receive from Park Jung-hoon in exchange for arranging a meeting with Goyo? What did he offer to make Lee Yi-taek act like this?</p>
<p>Come to think of it, Lee Yi-taek was holding Sungjo Daily, one of Korea’s leading newspapers.</p>
<p>‘It was quite an expensive auction item.’</p>
<p>‘I thought I’d won the bid and was ready to enjoy it.’</p>
<p>‘It’s still ongoing?’</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s words flashed through her mind, and Goyo snapped to attention.</p>
<p>This auction wasn’t over yet.</p>
<p>Realizing that, Goyo felt goosebumps all over her body.</p>
<p>“Don’t act so vulgar this time, like you did with CEO Kwon.”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>Since he was telling her not to give her body to Park Jung-hoon, he probably wasn’t the final bidder either.</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek must have realized something when he sent Goyo to Kwon Jae-heon as a test. That Goyo’s value was higher than he thought.</p>
<p>Even a single necklace had its price skyrocket when there was competition. There was no reason her value couldn’t increase even more.</p>
<p>At this rate, the final bidder might really be Kwon Jae-heon’s father, Kwon Moo-young.</p>
