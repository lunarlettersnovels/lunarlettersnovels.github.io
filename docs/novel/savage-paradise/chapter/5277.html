            <p><strong>Chapter 45.1</strong></p>
<p>“This much is nothing new.”</p>
<p>It sounded like being with her wasn’t any different from his past encounters.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like he said she was worse, so she should’ve felt relieved—but instead, a dull ache bloomed in her chest. He probably hadn’t meant anything by it, but suddenly, Ji Seo-hyun’s face surfaced in her mind.</p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun had likely pleased him, and Jae-heon had likely done the same for her. Not just Ji Seo-hyun—he must’ve touched and been with plenty of women before.</p>
<p>She’d known that. So why did it suddenly feel so heavy?</p>
<p>It must’ve been that feeling people often called jealousy. The way unfamiliar women’s faces kept flashing through her mind, overlapping with his, made that painfully clear.</p>
<p>“You must be proud. Lasting long and being good at it and all,” she muttered, unable to keep the bitterness out of her voice.</p>
<p>Jae-heon moved with practiced ease, confident and unrelenting. His experience gave him a kind of precision, pushing her past her limits before she had time to think. He could say the most shameless things with that effortlessly handsome face—like it was something to brag about.</p>
<p>“I mean, I am pretty amazing at it,” he said casually.</p>
<p>Even with her sarcasm, he didn’t skip a beat.</p>
<p>That unwavering confidence, paired with every movement of his, left her unable to do anything but gasp and cling to him, her back bumping softly against the cabinet. Embarrassed by the sound, she tightened her arms around his neck, pulling him closer.</p>
<p>“Ugh… you’ve… had a lot of experience, huh… I get it…”</p>
<p>All that experience must’ve come in handy. But the words didn’t leave her lips the way she intended.</p>
<p>She didn’t understand why it irritated her so much. His past had nothing to do with her. It wasn’t like they were in a relationship. If anything, she was just one of many.</p>
<p>Still, she couldn’t shake the sting in her chest.</p>
<p>Goyo didn’t realize it. Because her words came out in broken fragments between ragged breaths, what reached Jae-heon’s ears wasn’t a simple “must be nice,” but something altogether different.</p>
<p>“What—did that piss you off? Are you jealous right now?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>That wasn’t exactly what she said, but… it wasn’t entirely wrong either.</p>
<p>They were tangled together like this, and he had casually mentioned being with other women. What woman wouldn’t feel a pang of hurt at that? Anyone in her shoes would have, and if the roles were reversed, even he would have understood. Not that he was the kind of man who ever really considered how others felt.</p>
<p>“Hah… You getting jealous doesn’t feel bad, you know.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon let out a shallow breath and spoke slowly, as if savoring the moment.</p>
<p>“N-no… that’s not—hngh…”</p>
<p>The wet, intimate sounds of skin against skin echoed faintly through the small space. Overwhelmed by a sharp wave of pleasure that struck deep in her core, Goyo couldn’t help the choked cries that escaped her lips. She felt as if he were marking her, staking a claim—not just physically, but with every deep movement.</p>
<p>“Then show me. Make sure I don’t even think about anyone else.”</p>
<p>With that, he gripped her waist and drove into her with a sudden, relentless rhythm. Holding her tightly, he moved with fierce purpose, the sound of their bodies moving together filling the air. She gasped for air, unable to breathe properly from the sheer force of the sensation.</p>
<p>“Hngh—ah… I-I don’t… I can’t—ah!”</p>
<p>Her voice cracked as it rose into a desperate cry, resonating throughout the entryway. Startled by her own scream, Goyo clamped her mouth shut, gasping while glancing nervously toward the closed front door, her face twisted in both pleasure and restraint.</p>
<p>“The place is soundproof. Don’t hold back that pretty voice.”</p>
<p>He must’ve liked the way she sounded—his movements only grew rougher. Thud. Thump. Thud. His unrelenting rhythm drove into her with a force that made her feel like she might split apart.</p>
<p>They clung to each other, drunk on the feverish heat building between them, as though cursed with an endless hunger they couldn’t satisfy.</p>
<p>Goyo trembled as she moved with him, unable to stop herself. The stimulation radiated through her in waves, so overwhelming that she couldn’t even tell what was spilling from her body—whether it was release or something else. Her legs felt numb, her body too far gone to care.</p>
<p>“S-sob… ah…”</p>
<p>“Let it out. Don’t hold back.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon gave her no room to recover, pressing into her fully, deeper with each stroke, as if determined to reach the most hidden parts of her. He gripped her tightly, rocking her with such intensity that she felt like she was unraveling.</p>
<p>The sharp sounds of their bodies meeting continued without pause, and Goyo’s vision turned white at the edges, as if she were dissolving completely under him.</p>
