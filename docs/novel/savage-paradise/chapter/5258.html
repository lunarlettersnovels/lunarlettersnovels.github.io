            <p><strong>Chapter 54.2</strong></p>
<p>“…Secretary Ahn, I told you to turn off your phone. It’s noisy. I’m having a heart to heart talk with my son here.”</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young suddenly turned his head and grumbled. It was just as Secretary Ahn finished his call and sighed, looking at his phone screen.</p>
<p>“Chairman, even if we leave now, we’ll still be very late.”</p>
<p>“Shut it. I’m eating with my son before I go.”</p>
<p>Apparently satisfied with the conversation he’d had with Kwon Jae-heon, Kwon Moo-young’s mood had noticeably softened.</p>
<p>“I don’t trust Lee Yi-taek. There are other options. If he doesn’t listen, I’ll throw him away without hesitation.”</p>
<p>That must have been the answer Kwon Moo-young was hoping for.</p>
<p>Secretary Ahn, who had been anxiously watching Kwon Moo-young’s mood, seized the moment and quickly spoke up.</p>
<p>“They’ve prepared the banquet noodles you like, sir.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on. It’s the end of the year and I can’t even have a meal with my son? I came all this way! I’m going to eat. I said I am going to eat.”</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young started throwing a tantrum. Secretary Ahn glanced at Kwon Jae-heon, eyes pleading for him to rein in the chairman. Skipping a dinner with the president to linger here—it was enough to make anyone anxious.</p>
<p>“I’ll arrange something soon. For tonight, have dinner with someone else. The noodles will get soggy.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon was just as uncomfortable with his father sticking around. Especially with someone close to the president waiting on him.</p>
<p>“When? If you don’t give me a firm date, I won’t believe you. Come tomorrow. It’s New Year’s Day. Let’s have rice cake soup.”</p>
<p>“Father, you celebrate Lunar New Year. Since when did you care about the solar New Year?”</p>
<p>“I can see you on Lunar New Year too.”</p>
<p>“Okay, fine, just go. Please!”</p>
<p>“You too, darling, come over. I’ll fix you something nourishing. Then again, food alone might not cut it. To handle my son, maybe you’ll need some herbal tonic.”</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young looked at Goyo with a wistful smile.</p>
<p>Goyo didn’t understand a word of what was going on. Apparently, Kwon Jae-heon had suddenly decided to raise a snake, a giant one, like an anaconda.</p>
<p>Just earlier today, a client she met said raising snakes was creepy. Maybe it wasn’t as bad as she thought?</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young was clearly opposed. He even tried to appease his son by offering to buy him a dog instead, but Jae-heon didn’t seem to budge.</p>
<p>Goyo could understand where Kwon Moo-young was coming from. Who would like their kid raising snakes at home? She didn’t like snakes either. Cute dogs were better. She had always wanted to raise a small breed—like a Pomeranian, a Yorkshire Terrier, or a Maltese.</p>
<p>“Why do you care about my woman’s body?”</p>
<p>“Son, you should be grateful to me. You take after me, don’t you? Big down there, amazing in bed too.”</p>
<p>“Sigh… Father!”</p>
<p>“When I was young, I could handle three women for three days and nights straight without breaking a sweat. And since you’re just like me, I bet you can go just as long. That darling of yours will need a tonic just to survive you.”</p>
<p>As he said this, Kwon Moo-young winked at Goyo. A wink that seemed to say, You know what I’m talking about, right? Goyo’s face flushed red. So Kwon Jae-heon going non-stop for three days was because he inherited it from his father?</p>
<p>“Miss Ji, should I get you a tonic too?”</p>
<p>“N-No, Chairman, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>The arrow suddenly pointing her way startled Ji Seo-hyun. Goyo looked at her, seated beside Kwon Moo-young, and was reminded of Min Jae-yi, who’d had an affair with Lee Yoon-geon.</p>
<p>Even past seventy, Kwon Moo-young had enough stamina to keep a young, beautiful mistress. Which meant… Kwon Jae-heon probably wouldn’t lose his libido with age either.</p>
<p>“Miss Ji, you seem to lack stamina too. You’re too young to be this weak.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough, Father! This is disgusting.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon furrowed his brow and raised his voice. He neither cared about nor wanted to know his father’s sex life.</p>
<p>“You ungrateful bastard. I worked hard to bring you into this world, and this is how you repay me? Disrespecting your father? Shameful. Tsk. Brat.”</p>
<p>At Jae-heon’s sharp glare, Kwon Moo-young drooped his eyes and made a pitiful face. A master of wearing masks, he could even pull off a lisped whine perfectly. Anyone who knew the real Kwon Moo-young would find it chilling.</p>
<p>A man who wouldn’t flinch if someone died before his eyes. The kind who would smile while stabbing a blade into his opponent’s gut. The cruelty he displayed when eliminating enemies was said to be beyond description.</p>
<p>Like father, like son. Jae-heon, too, was someone who knew how to wear the appropriate mask for every occasion.</p>
