            <p><strong>Chapter 18.2</strong></p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun had treated her like dirt for the past 14 years. Maybe she was used to that kind of treatment because Jae-heon’s blunt words didn’t faze her.</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon bit into the square package between his index and middle fingers. Goyo’s gaze wavered.</p>
<p>He had already taken out a condom and was rolling it onto his. The artificial scent of latex pierced through the heavy smell of s*x, reaching her nose. Seeing his thick, prec*m-leaking manhood made her entrance spasm.</p>
<p>“People call me a bastard, too.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon grabbed the shaft and rubbed the head against her. The smooth head brushed against her cl*t, causing her to gasp.</p>
<p>As Goyo let out a shallow breath, Jae-heon pushed the wet head inside her.</p>
<p>Her well-lubricated entrance, still loose from their earlier encounter, quickly swallowed the thick flesh, releasing a gush of fluids.</p>
<p>“Let’s have fun like the bastards we are.”</p>
<p>“Huh, what?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Goyo’s world turned upside down.</p>
<p>Jae-heon had flipped her over while still inside her. She buried her face in the crumpled sheets, stifling a scream.</p>
<p>“Bastards should f.uck like bastards.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon pulled her hips up while she lay flat on her stomach, whispering as he pressed close.</p>
<p>“W-wait… what are you doing?”</p>
<p>With her face buried in the sheets and her knees bent, her hips were raised in the air. Just as he said, it was the mating position of dogs.</p>
<p>“No, ugh, no, I don’t want to, ah…!”</p>
<p>“You said you liked it, and now you don’t? I wonder why.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon leaned forward, placing his hand over hers, intertwining their fingers tightly.</p>
<p>Would being penetrated like this make her an animal?</p>
<p>Saying it didn’t matter wasn’t the same as asking to be treated that way. Even dulled wounds hurt when poked again.</p>
<p>“Ah, ugh, no… ah.”</p>
<p>“Should I stop?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon began to move slowly, rubbing his hard, thick shaft against her entrance.</p>
<p>“Goyo, should I stop?”</p>
<p>Despite his words, he pressed his veined manhood against her wet entrance.</p>
<p>“If you tell me to stop, I will.”</p>
<p>He withdrew his hips, pulling himself out.</p>
<p>“I-it’s not that I don’t want… I just… it’s not… ah, ah.”</p>
<p>“You mean when I said I’d f*ck you like an animal?”</p>
<p>“Hah, just… a bit more gently… please.”</p>
<p>Fluids dripped from her opening, soaking the sheets. She claimed not to want to be treated like an animal, but her body reacted otherwise.</p>
<p>“I was being gentle.”</p>
<p>“This… is gentle…?”</p>
<p>What kind of s*x had this man been having if he thought this was gentle?</p>
<p>“I gave you a friendly warning that it would be rough. I kindly used my mouth to make sure you wouldn’t tear. I took my time widening you with careful thrusts, and I diligently found and hit the spots that made you feel good.”</p>
<p>His voice, tinged with laughter, was thick with an unbearable pleasure.</p>
<p>“I asked for your permission every step of the way.”</p>
<p>“Please, stop…”</p>
<p>How had it come to this? The things happening to her were so embarrassing; it was hard to believe.</p>
<p>“Even now, I’m holding back from thrusting in because you said you didn’t want it. How could I be more gentle?”</p>
<p>“…Ah, ah.”</p>
<p>Holding back? He was clearly satisfying his own desires.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I mention? It’s been a while since I’ve had s*x, so I’ve got a lot built up.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon grabbed her wrists, holding them together with one hand and pinning them above her head. With his other hand, he pressed down on her neck, pushing her forehead into the sheets and arching her back.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>His hand moved from her neck down her spine and grabbed her buttocks. Then, his hard shaft plunged into her tight opening without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>The deep penetration made it feel like her belly was being pierced, taking her breath away. She gritted her teeth, pounding her head against the mattress, her face likely contorted in pain.</p>
<p>Her back twisted unnaturally, and her bones felt like they might snap. Her calves and feet were so stiff from the tension in her knees that they were on the verge of cramping.</p>
<p>“Ah, it hurts… ah, ugh!”</p>
<p>Goyo groaned, panting heavily.</p>
<p>“Sweetie, it’s going to be a problem if you get tired before we even start.”</p>
<p>Veins bulged on the back of Jae-heon’s hand as he gripped her buttocks and began thrusting powerfully. He pulled his head out to the entrance and then plunged it deep inside in one swift motion.</p>
<p>Each deep thrust made their connection tremble. Her insides burned from the relentless pounding. Her legs gave out, causing her raised hips to slump down. The penetrating shaft slipped out, jabbing against her buttocks.</p>
<p>“Tsk. Almost went in the wrong hole.”</p>
<p>“Ah, uh, where… ah, ah.”</p>
<p>“The usual places back there.”</p>
<p>He lifted her slumped hips.</p>
<p>“Just say the word, and I’ll put it where you want.”</p>
<p>“Ah, please… ugh.”</p>
<p>When his head pressed insistently against her anal entrance, Goyo snapped to attention. The fear of it slipping into her anus made her hair stand on end.</p>
<p>“Say it clearly. I need to understand.”</p>
<p>“No, not there… not… ah, ah.”</p>
<p>“Which hole do you want it in?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s voice, once leisurely, now held an edge of urgency.</p>
<p>Like someone losing control, he thrust his hips forcefully. His blunt head mashed between the two openings, then slipped down and into her entrance.</p>
