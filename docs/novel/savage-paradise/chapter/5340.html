            <p><strong>Chapter 12.1</strong></p>
<p>Jae-heon could easily guess who was persistently calling Goyo. The incessant phone calls made it clear that the caller knew that his “toy” was with another man in a hotel room.</p>
<p>Jae-heon wondered. If Lee Yoon-gun found out that his coveted “toy,” which he had tried so hard to possess, had been given to someone else by his father as part of a settlement for Jae-heon’s accident, what would his reaction be?</p>
<p>Would he just continue to vent his anger on the phone like this?</p>
<p>Ring, ring.</p>
<p>“Thinking about another guy while having s*x with me isn’t cool either.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s relaxed gaze met Goyo’s uneasy pupils, which were trembling. She was too preoccupied with Jae-heon’s scrutiny to answer the phone, clutching her bag tightly instead.</p>
<p>All Jae-heon had to do was tell her to answer it, but he didn’t want to.</p>
<p>Ring, ring.</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun persisted, relentless and stubborn, just like his father. The phone kept ringing incessantly, conveying Lee Yoon-gun’s emotions through its vibrations.</p>
<p>“If you were that precious to him, he should have kept you on a leash and held onto you tightly.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon was itching to chew up the missed opportunity of Goyo, from head to toe, starting now.</p>
<p>Ring, ring.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to go to that bastard who’s desperately looking for you.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s lips curled fiercely as they came close to Goyo’s.</p>
<p>“Focus on me.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon wrapped his arms around Goyo’s waist and pulled her close. He expected some resistance, but she easily succumbed to his embrace.</p>
<p>As Jae-heon lowered his head and pressed his lips against hers, Goyo just stared blankly, unsure if it was the gaze of a beast or if she was intoxicated by the scent emanating from Jae-heon’s embrace.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the heat emanating from their tightly pressed lips started to rise that Goyo realized what he was doing to her. Unconsciously, she parted her lips, accepting Jae-heon’s tongue.</p>
<p>The mesmerizing gaze and the strong scent of a dominant male intensified. Goyo exhaled softly, closing her eyes. Thud. Her bag fell to the ground with a heavy sound.</p>
<p>The unfamiliar sensation overwhelmed Goyo, causing her body to tremble involuntarily. His rough breath made her shiver uncontrollably. If she hadn’t been leaning against the front door, her legs would have given out, and she would have collapsed to the floor. Even now, trying to retreat was futile, as the man’s large hand enveloped the back of her head, preventing any escape.</p>
<p>“Ha… Ah…”</p>
<p>A soft exhale, almost a moan, escaped Goyo’s lips. The forceful suction made her tongue tingle uncomfortably.</p>
<p>As Goyo’s moans intensified, Jae-heon pulled her closer, tilting her head to insert his tongue from a different angle. With each meeting and parting of their lips, she tasted the whiskey on his tongue. His breath inside her mouth was so hot it felt like melting.</p>
<p>“Ha… Ha…”</p>
<p>This was all new to her, making it difficult for Goyo to keep up. Jae-heon’s persistent tongue entwined with hers, coaxing it to respond. Despite her resistance, he skillfully maneuvered her tongue, sucking on it eagerly.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Jae-heon pulled his hand through her hair and tugged, urging her tongue deeper into his mouth. Their tongues tangled, creating a sticky, thick sound. The intense kissing alone was disorienting enough, but Jae-heon’s potent scent, wafting into her nostrils, added to her dizziness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Goyo felt a sharp ache in her lower abdomen, as if it were engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>“Hoo…”</p>
<p>Jae-heon exhaled softly, adding more pressure on Goyo. His forceful suction made her tongue ache at the base while simultaneously giving it a bitter and sweet taste at its tip.</p>
<p>Their joined lips released soft moans and hot breaths incessantly. As Jae-heon’s tongue movements grew rougher, Goyo wrapped her arms around his neck, relying on his body for support. Sensing his firm thigh muscles pressing between her legs, Goyo couldn’t help but let out a moan involuntarily.</p>
<p>“Hnn…”</p>
<p>With her nose being pressed and her mouth obstructed, even breathing became difficult. In her haste to inhale, Goyo accidentally bit down on Jae-heon’s tongue. A metallic taste of blood spread through their mouths.</p>
<p>“Hmm, quite amateurish.”</p>
<p>He muttered his critique with their lips still touching, his low voice tickling her with each humid breath.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect to taste blood.”</p>
