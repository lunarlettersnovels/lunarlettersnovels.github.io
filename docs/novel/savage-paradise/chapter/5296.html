            <p><strong>Chapter 35.2</strong></p>
<p>“….A gift to win my heart?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t like it, I can buy you something else.”</p>
<p>He ran his finger over the chain of the necklace, as if he would take it off and throw it away if Goyo didn’t like it. Goyo shook her head.</p>
<p>“It’s not that… Ah.”</p>
<p>It was too one-sided.</p>
<p>Was this how he always did things, or was it just with her? If it was just with her, why was that?</p>
<p>Goyo had no idea what to do with the necklace. She wasn’t brave enough to wear a 10 billion won necklace.</p>
<p>What if she lost it by accident, or what if someone with bad intentions tried to take it? She would be worried about the necklace all day.</p>
<p>“Or is it that you don’t like me, so you don’t even want the gift? You said my face was to your taste, but was that all a lie?”</p>
<p>Now, his unreasonable behavior seemed natural. His calm tone made it feel like this was all just a dream, and she was lying in a hospital bed, imagining everything.</p>
<p>“After giving you my body, my heart, and a gift, you’re telling me you don’t know me? Am I being played?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s eyebrows twitched, and his lip curled up in a fierce smile. His hand, which had been stroking the necklace slid to her neck.</p>
<p>“It’s surprising that you’re acting like you don’t know me now.”</p>
<p>His fingers dug a bit deeper into her skin. For a moment, she thought he was going to strangle her, right there in front of all these people.</p>
<p>“Our Goyo is so irresponsible, I didn’t know. Did you think you could just sleep with me and then ignore me? Did you think I was just a one-night stand?”</p>
<p>Goyo didn’t understand what he was saying. Who was sleeping with whom and ignoring whom?</p>
<p>Besides, she was a virgin until she met him. Unlike Kwon Jae-heon, who had slept with countless women.</p>
<p>And he should speak clearly. When did he give her his heart?</p>
<p>They had only had a proper conversation for the first time two nights ago. They had spent the night together, but if Ji Seo-hyun hadn’t intervened, he would have given his body and heart to her instead. Where did he get the nerve to say such things?</p>
<p>The gift was the same. She hadn’t asked for it, and he had even bought it for Ji Seo-hyun, as Park Jung-hoon could attest.</p>
<p>These feelings of injustice swirled in her throat, unable to be expressed. Kwon Jae-heon leaned in, his low, husky voice whispering in her ear.</p>
<p>“Do you know why I gave you my number?”</p>
<p>His previous threat, “I’m the one who throws you away, not the other way around,” took on a new meaning. Was he saying that if she didn’t listen to him, he would kill her?</p>
<p>“I, I was sincere too.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s voice trembled with fear as Kwon Jae-heon’s grip on her neck tightened.</p>
<p>“I thought you were sincere too.”</p>
<p>He smiled, showing his teeth, and released his grip on her neck.</p>
<p>The sudden change in temperature, from cold to hot, left Goyo feeling like her soul was escaping.</p>
<p>“I’m more conservative than I thought.”</p>
<p>Goyo was taken aback by his words. It was a ridiculous thing to say, but she couldn’t argue with him.</p>
<p>It was similar to what she had said to him a few days ago, “My family is very strict.” She understood now why he had looked at her with a mixture of surprise and amusement. He must have thought she was being ridiculous, just like she thought he was being now.</p>
<p>“If you’ve made a mistake, you should take responsibility, shouldn’t you?” Kwon Jae-heon’s voice was low and gentle as he stroked her neck.</p>
<p>Goyo was flabbergasted. What responsibility was he talking about? He wasn’t taking responsibility for all the women he had slept with, was he?</p>
<p>It was a suspicious thing to say, but the way he said it with a straight face, like he was discussing something serious, made it hard to think it was just a joke.</p>
<p>“Who are you talking about? Me taking responsibility for you?” She was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>Or was it the other way around? Was he saying he would take responsibility for her?</p>
<p>It was absurd, considering she had gone through so much with him over the weekend. But Kwon Jae-heon didn’t give her a chance to respond, pushing her to answer.</p>
<p>“We slept together, didn’t we?”</p>
<p>“But didn’t you sleep with many others, CEO?” Goyo was taken aback by the sudden turn of events.</p>
<p>She stared at Kwon Jae-heon’s face, her eyes wide with surprise, and he chuckled at her reaction. His smile was so charming that it seemed to stop her breath.</p>
<p>“You don’t like that kind of thing, do you?”</p>
<p>She made it clear that it was just a one-night stand.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed,” Kwon Jae-heon said, resting his chin on his hand.</p>
<p>“I told you I’d give you the most expensive gift,” he whispered, his face close to hers.</p>
<p>His low, husky voice sent shivers down her spine.</p>
<p>His voice was smooth and pleasant, with a clear tone that conveyed his intentions precisely. It was a stark contrast to Goyo’s own speech, which was often mumbled and unclear.</p>
<p>“So, you’ll only open your legs for me…”</p>
<p>“CEO!”</p>
<p>Goyo covered Kwon Jae-heon’s mouth with her palm, not wanting to hear the rest of his sentence. She could already guess what he was going to say.</p>
