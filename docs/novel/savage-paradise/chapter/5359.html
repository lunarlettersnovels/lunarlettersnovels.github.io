            <p><strong>Chapter 2.1</strong></p>
<p>Thwack, thwack!</p>
<p>With each blow striking flesh, a tearing scream echoed pitifully.</p>
<p>“Agh! I-I’m dying! Ugh! S-save me… Aaaagh!”</p>
<p>A man lay curled up on the floor, writhing and screaming.</p>
<p>From his ugly, wailing voice and the blood-covered mess of his face, it was clear that the person Goyo needed to take away from here was Lee Yeon-gun.</p>
<p>From the ugly, croaking voice and bloodied face, it was Lee Yeon-gun, the man Goyo needed to get out of here.</p>
<p>“What did I do wrong? You bastards! Talk to me, damn it!”</p>
<p>Attempting to plead his case, Lee Yeon-gun raised his head but had to curl up again as a rough kick flew toward him.</p>
<p>“Agh! S-stop hitting me! Ugh.”</p>
<p>Sensing the ominous atmosphere, Goyo couldn’t bring herself to go inside and stood hesitantly in front of the entrance.</p>
<p>Lee Yeon-gun was the son of Lee Yi-taek, a powerful figure in the ruling party. Yi-taek, a three-term congressman and former chief prosecutor, had allowed his son to commit countless crimes without punishment. Lee Yeon-gun even used his father’s influence to turn victims into perpetrators.</p>
<p>Who on earth would do this to Lee Yeon-gun? Goyo couldn’t believe what she was seeing.</p>
<p>“N-noona! Who are these bastards?”</p>
<p>T/N: *Noona – older woman</p>
<p>Curious about the woman Lee Yeon-gun was desperately reaching out to and calling Noona, Goyo looked around.</p>
<p>A woman was sitting in front of the glass door leading to the terrace. Judging by the menacing man blocking the door, she seemed to have been caught trying to escape.</p>
<p>“Noona! You said you didn’t have a lover–” Yoon-geon sobbed, “Why did you lie to me… Ugh!”</p>
<p>“Shut up, please, just shut up.” The woman, clutching the robe wrapped around her naked body, trembled violently.</p>
<p>“You lied to me? Damn it. You said I was the only one!”</p>
<p>“When did I ever say that!” The woman, shivering, raised her voice.</p>
<p>Her face was ghostly pale, and her whole body shook as if she were trembling like an aspen leaf. Sitting on the floor with her hair down, she looked like a traitor awaiting the executioner’s blade.</p>
<p>They must have been having a good time before the intruders barged in, as both were naked, only covered by bathrobes.</p>
<p>‘Is this an affair?’</p>
<p>Caught red-handed on the spot, they were being punished more immediately than the law could.</p>
<p>Relying on his father’s power, Yoon-geon had acted recklessly without fear, but today, he met his match.</p>
<p>“Why am I the only one getting hit? Damn it, it hurts!”</p>
<p>Lee Yeon-gun yelled, covering his head with his arms. Blaming the woman to escape the situation was typical of him.</p>
<p>Then who should they hit if not you? Goyo found him absurd.</p>
<p>Well, it takes two to tango. Both are at fault, but Yoon-geon is the only one getting hit. Knowing the atrocities he had committed, it was hard to feel sympathy for him.</p>
<p>More importantly… The congressman, his father, must have known this would happen, so he sent Goyo instead of his staff.</p>
<p>Goyo swallowed dryly and bit her lower lip. Early this morning, Congressman Lee Yi-taek had called her.</p>
<p>“Yoon-geon is at the Han-young Resort. With a woman.”</p>
<p>Is that a problem? That was her first thought upon hearing Lee Yi-taek’s words.</p>
<p>Women were a constant presence around his only son, Lee Yeon-gun. He fell in love easily and just as quickly fell out of it. Congressman Lee Yi-taek knew well about his son’s fleeting relationships, akin to a boiling and cooling aluminum pot. Therefore, he never paid much attention to whom his son was dating.</p>
<p>“Yoon-geon went on a trip to Namhae with you yesterday. It makes me happy to see siblings getting along so well.”</p>
<p>Siblings, father…</p>
<p>Goyo barely stifled a sarcastic laugh at the sudden use of such terms.</p>
<p>She was indeed Lee Yi-taek’s adopted daughter, so the term wasn’t technically incorrect. However, he only played the role of a loving father in front of others when it was necessary. In reality, he never treated her as his child.</p>
<p>Hearing him talk about a ‘sibling trip’ made his intentions seem suspicious.</p>
<p>Regardless of her feelings, Goyo had to head to Cheongdo immediately. The order was to create verifiable evidence of a family trip.</p>
<p>“I planned this as a family trip, but due to sudden engagements, I couldn’t attend. Just say you went there to play golf, enjoy the hot springs, and relax at the resort.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t fathom what kind of woman Lee Yeon-gun had met that would prompt Yi-taek to fabricate such a ridiculous alibi and send her all the way to Cheongdo. Goyo hoped it was a situation she could quietly manage and set off for Cheongdo.</p>
<p>As soon as she arrived at the private villa where Lee Yeon-gun and his lover were staying, Goyo sensed something was wrong. Three black mid-sized cars were lined up in the driveway, and the front door, which should have been closed, was wide open.</p>
<p>Still, she wasn’t too worried. It wasn’t the first time Lee Yeon-gun had caused trouble. She thought, “This can be handled with the congressman’s backing again,” and stepped inside.</p>
<p>‘Congressman, is this really a situation I can handle?’</p>
