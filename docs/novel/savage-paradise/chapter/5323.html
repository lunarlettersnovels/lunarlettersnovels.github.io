            <p><strong>Chapter 21.2</strong></p>
<p>While she was wrapped in the sheet without clothes, Jae-heon was wearing a bathrobe. His broad, well-defined chest was visible beneath the robe, along with his clearly defined abs, the prominent iliac crests sloping down from his waist, and…</p>
<p>He had left the robe open without tying the belt, so a large, prominent bulge was clearly visible through the gap.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Only then did Goyo realize she had been staring at Jae-heon’s lower half with a lost expression. She quickly turned her gaze away, blushing red and covering her flushed cheeks with her hands.</p>
<p>“I know you’re into my c0ck, but it’s hard to resist when you look at it like that.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>“You tempted me.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon smiled suggestively, narrowing his eyes.</p>
<p>“When did I do that?”</p>
<p>She had merely seen it because he was wearing a bathrobe, and the loose robe naturally drew her eyes to it. How could she not notice it when it was sticking out like that?</p>
<p>If she were to make excuses, she would say that after hours of it, it would be dead, but she was just a little—very slightly—surprised that it wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Was it not enough?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Let’s take a break and try again.”</p>
<p>Even though Goyo had been sheltered in a greenhouse, she wasn’t so naive as to misunderstand the meaning of his words.</p>
<p>“Are you joking?”</p>
<p>Goyo regained her composure and quickly managed her expression. Jae-heon let out a soft chuckle.</p>
<p>“I won’t bite, so just sit down.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It was a lie.</p>
<p>“Not now, though.”</p>
<p>He added.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>She had seen that look in his eyes plenty in the bedroom. It was the same look he had when he was lost in pleasure, half-losing his reason as he thrust into her. He would push and penetrate regardless of her pleas, threatening and demanding more.</p>
<p>She had been driven to cling to him, writhing in pleasure, caught up in the madness along with him.</p>
<p>“Do you want a drink?”</p>
<p>As Goyo sat down, Jae-heon offered her a drink. She nodded eagerly, as she had been craving alcohol.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s a bit strong for a child.”</p>
<p>He filled the glass with ice and poured whiskey over it.</p>
<p>His hand holding the whiskey bottle was quite beautiful. It was hard to believe that this delicate and lovely hand had mercilessly struck Yoon-gun. The long fingers seemed perfect for playing the piano. Those beautiful fingers had cruelly violated her most precious parts.</p>
<p>He had explored her body with such fervor, and now he was treating her like a child.</p>
<p>“I’m not a child.”</p>
<p>Goyo muttered as she held the glass.</p>
<p>She tried to imitate Jae-heon, swirling the drink slowly, but the ice-filled cup made no pretty clinking sound.</p>
<p>It had been somewhat charming when he did it.</p>
<p>“Oh, really? I didn’t know.”</p>
<p>“If I’m a child, then you should go to the police station.”</p>
<p>It was partly said out of spite. The term “child” grated on her nerves.</p>
<p>In a few days, she would turn twenty-one. Although there was a significant age gap between them, she wasn’t at an age where she should be treated like a child.</p>
<p>Was she really that childish? She had been so careful with her appearance to avoid looking too young.</p>
<p>“It’s scary.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon chuckled, finding the trivial threat amusing.</p>
<p>Goyo was annoyed that Jae-heon still treated her like a child. Frustrated, she grabbed the glass and took a swig of the alcohol. The sharp, bitter taste filled her mouth, enough to make her tongue tingle.</p>
<p>“…Ugh.”</p>
<p>Her nose scrunched up involuntarily.</p>
<p>It was even more bitter and stronger than she had expected. Still, she didn’t want to seem childish, so she swallowed it down, feeling the fiery heat of the strong liquor as it slid down her throat.</p>
