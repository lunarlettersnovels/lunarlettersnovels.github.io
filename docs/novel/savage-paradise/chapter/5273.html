            <p><strong>Chapter 47.1</strong></p>
<p>“You really want to know?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s lips curled lazily into a smile. Instead of answering, he threw the question back at her. Goyo slowly shook her head.</p>
<p>She was scared of what he might say. Afraid he’d casually toss out a line like You don’t mean that much to me.</p>
<p>“Coward. I would’ve told you.”</p>
<p>He let out a small laugh and kept moving his hips. His cock, slick with her arousal, kept plunging between her thighs—wet, sticky, hot.</p>
<p>“Oh, one more thing. You only pick up my calls.”</p>
<p>Her body writhed instinctively, but Jae-heon only gripped her tighter and thrust deeper.</p>
<p>“Say it.”</p>
<p>Each time his thick shaft slammed into her, it felt like something inside her shattered. Like her body would crumble to dust at any second.</p>
<p>Her chest pressed flat against the wooden table, which groaned and scraped against the floor with every brutal thrust. Her juices dripped down her thighs, pooling onto the floor. The pleasure spreading from her belly twisted her entire body in response.</p>
<p>“Haa… mm, okay. Y-Yes… mm.”</p>
<p>Only after giving him the answer he wanted did Jae-heon finally let her go.</p>
<p>“Who… are these people? And what is all this?”</p>
<p>Goyo lay on the sofa, completely limp, like a sponge soaked and wrung out. Jae-heon had jumped her mid-breakfast, and now she couldn’t lift a finger.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the intercom buzzed, and a small crowd poured into the apartment.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, they set up a long table in the middle of the living room and began arranging shoes, handbags, and jewelry on top. A portable clothing rack was wheeled in, hung with rows of designer women’s clothing.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Jae-heon’s living room looked like a luxury boutique.</p>
<p>Personal shopper service.</p>
<p>She’d heard of it before but had never seen one in action. It was new to her, but clearly not to Jae-heon.</p>
<p>With a simple nod from him, the staff began treating Goyo like a VIP customer, presenting items and explaining their latest collections.</p>
<p>“In addition to the items the CEO requested, we’ve brought a few of our newest arrivals as well.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead. Pick something you like.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon sat on the sofa with one leg crossed over the other, flipping through a catalog without so much as glancing at her.</p>
<p>It was as if he weren’t the same man who had just ravaged her minutes earlier.</p>
<p>“We could’ve just gone to a department store. This seems… excessive.”</p>
<p>“Going there is more of a hassle. Waste of time, too.”</p>
<p>“Is there a particular event you’re looking forward to attending?”</p>
<p>“No, not really… Wait—is today already… the end of the month?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon gave a nod, a small smile tugging at his lips.</p>
<p>It had been several days since she arrived at his house. If there was an event, it was probably for the year’s end—or maybe the start of a new one. The thought made her uneasy. Had a whole year really passed?</p>
<p>“So, a year-end party, then.”</p>
<p>Around this time, every organization threw parties and gatherings. She knew how many invitations poured in for Lee Eui-taek each December, so it made sense that a man like Jae-heon, a powerful capitalist, would be in high demand too.</p>
<p>If he was attending, it had to be an important one.</p>
<p>But surprisingly, there wasn’t much Goyo had to prepare. No need to wander from store to store downtown. No early-morning beauty appointments. She just had to sit back on the sofa and pick something she liked from what the personal shoppers had brought.</p>
