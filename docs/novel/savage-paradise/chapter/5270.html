            <p><strong>Chapter 48.2</strong></p>
<p>“If someone heard that, they might think I kidnapped her.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon lifted the coffee cup placed on the table. His elegant manner of sipping coffee looked like a scene from a coffee advertisement, but to Lee Yi-taek, it only appeared to be a mockery.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek didn’t hide his displeasure and expressed it openly.</p>
<p>It was indeed true. Jae-heon had smashed their phones so they couldn’t contact him and had taken her to his house, where they couldn’t keep an eye on her. From Lee Yi-taek’s perspective, it could easily be seen as kidnapping.</p>
<p>“It’s hurtful to hear you say that.”</p>
<p>He had sent her to him beautifully decorated, telling him to take good care of her. But now that Jae-heon showed interest, he was suddenly playing games.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you put her in a hotel room?”</p>
<p>“Let’s be clear, it was you who went into the hotel room holding my daughter’s hand.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek wasn’t the type to hold a grudge just because his son had been beaten a few times. He would undoubtedly demand something bigger.</p>
<p>“Oh, was that so? That’s unfortunate. If she was such a precious daughter to you, you should have kept her out of my sight.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon narrowed his eyes as he set the coffee cup down on the table.</p>
<p>“To think that my successor is Park Jeong-hoon. That stings my pride a bit.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek seemed uninterested in drinking anything, as the coffee in front of him was growing cold, untouched. It indicated that he had no desire to share a cup of coffee with Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“It was a gathering arranged because Executive Director Park wanted to have a meal with my daughter.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like you genuinely like someone as insignificant as Park Jeong-hoon.”</p>
<p>If he truly liked Park Jeong-hoon, he would have pushed him into a hotel room instead of a coffee lounge with open space. Lee Yi-taek believed that he was merely using Park Jeong-hoon to provoke Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>‘Park Jeong-hoon is just bait.’</p>
<p>It was also a warning to pay a higher price to prevent someone else from taking Goyo away.</p>
<p>“But what can you do? The person you have in mind the most has already slipped away.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“My father.”</p>
<p>If that was his target, he should have sent Goyo to me first instead of the old man.</p>
<p>After admitting Goyo to the hospital, the first thing Kwon Jae-heon needed to do was to attach a woman to the old man. Kwon Moo-young had not touched any women younger than him until now, but it was still unsettling. So, Jae-heon planned to take the initiative to ensure Kwon Moo-young wouldn’t even have the chance to be interested in Goyo.</p>
<p>While he was pondering whether there was a good plan, he received a report that Kwon Moo-young had gotten a woman. After hearing the details, Jae-heon couldn’t help but chuckle in disbelief for a while.</p>
<p>Even though the old man had aged, his tastes remained the same. A hopeless romantic who risked everything for a fateful encounter. But to others, it looked like a trashy drama.</p>
<p>“Hm, you say it’s too late?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>Recently, he had been unusually sloppy in his work. Making mistakes he wouldn’t normally make due to being infatuated with a woman could understandably irritate the old man. Kwon Moo-young was furious and summoned Jae-heon.</p>
<p>Knowing he would only hear scolding if he went, he made an excuse about a commercial shoot for Moo-young Construction apartments. That prompted the impatient old man to come directly to the filming location to find him. However, what the old man discovered on set was not his disobedient son but the sexy actress Ji Seo-hyun.</p>
<p>“I’ll be quite busy for the time being.”</p>
<p>He would be busy catering to his young lover’s needs.</p>
<p>In just a few days, the old man had fallen head over heels for Ji Seo-hyun, captivated by her charm. Along with a promise of full support for her expansion into the U.S. market, he managed to get a diamond necklace even more expensive than the one Jae-heon had purchased at the auction.</p>
<p>It seemed that Jae-heon’s pride was hurt by the fact that the necklace he won had gone to another woman. Receiving such an expensive necklace to wear around his neck in just a few days showed that. Anyway, Ji Seo-hyun was undoubtedly a smart woman. She wouldn’t be discarded for a foolish reason like Min Jei.</p>
<p>“Thanks to that, I’ve become the hole-in-the-wall sister-in-law.”</p>
<p>But in this industry, which is essentially a jungle, perhaps it didn’t matter?</p>
<p>A woman with Ji Seo-hyun’s level of experience would be able to keep the old man firmly in check. With her skills in the bedroom, there was no way Moo-young would turn her attention to the innocent Goyo.</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young would shower Ji Seo-hyun with many gifts, but it was certainly not a losing business deal. He could afford that much petty cash.</p>
<p>The real problem was not the old man, but Kwon Jae-heon himself.</p>
