            <p><strong>Chapter 18.1</strong></p>
<p>Even while he groped, sucked, and bit her bre*sts, his dark red member furiously thrust into the tight hole. With each movement of Jae-heon, he emerged and then disappeared again. Goyo twisted and struggled, but Jae-heon continued his rough thrusting.</p>
<p>Thwack, thud—thud! The sound of wet flesh slapping together mingled with Goyo’s piercing moans.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh, ha, don’t, ah… ah!”</p>
<p>“Hoo.”</p>
<p>As Goyo screamed, he groaned through gritted teeth, thrusting his hips with all his strength.</p>
<p>“Hoo, hoo.”</p>
<p>As he reached his cl!max, his thrusts became relentless. He furiously pounded inside her at a terrifying speed. The opening, constantly invaded by the large mass of flesh, trembled as if in convulsions.</p>
<p>Jae-heon growled like a beast every time her muscles contracted around him.</p>
<p>“Hah, hoo…!”</p>
<p>Breathing heavily, Jae-heon tensed his body. He thrust deeply, burying himself as far as it could go, and came for a long time. Then, he moved his hips slowly, savoring the afterglow.</p>
<p>With his continuous thrusts, white foam bubbled in and around her opening.</p>
<p>“Hah, hah, hah, hoo.”</p>
<p>Goyo exhaled heavily, her body completely limp.</p>
<p>It was finally over.</p>
<p>As she caught her breath, the flesh that had filled her so completely slid out. Sticky fluids clung to the silicone membrane, and the condom was filled with milky liquid.</p>
<p>Jae-heon grabbed the rubber end and pulled it out. His expression was incredibly sensual as he removed the rubber sheath from his pen.</p>
<p>“Goyo.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon called her name with a breathy voice, his eyes unfocused. It was a name she had heard all her life, but somehow, it sounded unfamiliar to Goyo.</p>
<p>“Lee Goyo.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He was simply calling her name softly.</p>
<p>So casually, like it was nothing.</p>
<p>A name that anyone could have. A name that Lee Taek and Lee Yun-gun had called countless times.</p>
<p>…Yet her heart fluttered.</p>
<p>A strange emotion she had never felt before made her body tremble. Something deep within her, something hard and rigid, began to soften and melt.</p>
<p>“Goyo, …talk to me.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Lost in the tender feelings, she didn’t quite catch what Jae-heon had said.</p>
<p>“If you have any preferences, let me know. I’ll do my best to meet them.”</p>
<p>“Preferences?”</p>
<p>Goyo asked, her face blank.</p>
<p>“It’s better if we both enjoy it, right?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon said, smiling as he took off his shirt.</p>
<p>Only then did Goyo realize that, unlike her disheveled state, he had only unbuttoned his pants. He quickly removed the rest of his clothes and gave her a playful wink.</p>
<p>“If you really don’t know, just trust me.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s eyes sparkled brightly. Compared to the flustered and fumbling Goyo, he was composed in every way.</p>
<p>“Let’s get serious.”</p>
<p>She quickly understood what he meant by getting serious. Jae-heon wiggled a new condom between his long fingers, waving it in front of her.</p>
<p>“What? So what we did until now…?”</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>Goyo mumbled as she stared blankly at the rubber swinging before her eyes.</p>
<p>“That was just one round. Think of it as a warm-up before the main event.”</p>
<p>“One round… really?”</p>
<p>Even if you don’t count what happened at the entrance, he finished on her face and just now as well.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t count if it’s just oral or hand play.”</p>
<p>“Is that… so?”</p>
<p>Even if what happened at the entrance wasn’t a full count since it wasn’t an actual penetration, shouldn’t one time be enough?</p>
<p>“Why…?”</p>
<p>She swallowed hard, looking at Jae-heon’s large member. Amazingly, it was still standing erect. The thick shaft, with its bulging veins, twitched as it oozed clear fluid from the blunt head.</p>
<p>“Looks like someone didn’t get proper s*x education.”</p>
<p>“…I know enough.”</p>
<p>What she learned during s*x education in school was…</p>
<p>S*xual intercourse involves the insertion of the pen*s into the vag*na to facilitate the union of sperm and egg. This insertion includes the act of advancing and retreating the male organ within the female reproductive organ until ejaculat!on occurs.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“You know it’s something you do until we can’t go anymore, right?”</p>
<p>“I heard that it’s hard to go again after ejaculat!ng once.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like you’ve only been around losers.”</p>
<p>Goyo thought of the young men in her life. Unfortunately, there was only Lee Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>She knew Lee Yoon-gun was promiscuous, but she wasn’t familiar with his s*x life details. So, she couldn’t tell if Kwon Jae-heon’s stamina was average or extraordinary. But his confidence suggested it was far from ordinary.</p>
<p>“Kids might finish after one round, but bastards like me can go all night.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>So, her understanding of s*x wasn’t entirely wrong.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon was just an exception.</p>
<p>Goyo looked at Jae-heon like he was a beast and covered herself with the sheet. But Jae-heon quickly pulled it away, exposing her naked body down to the last hair.</p>
<p>“What’s there to hide when we’ve already seen everything?”</p>
<p>“What kind of relationship do we have? We’re nothing to each other.” Just a one-night stand, nothing more, nothing less. When Goyo closed her legs, Jae-heon immediately spread them open again.</p>
<p>“Nothing to each other, huh?” He was somehow disturbed.</p>
<p>The opening between her spread legs revealed reddened flesh and was oozing white fluid.</p>
<p>“Your brother and my father are, shall we say, intimate. And your father kindly sent you to me.”</p>
<p>What do you even call this?</p>
<p>“Hmm, a messed-up family tree you got there.”</p>
<p>“A messed-up family tree…”</p>
<p>“What? Are you upset because I called it messed up?”</p>
<p>“…No.” She wasn’t upset; it was just the first time someone had said it so bluntly.</p>
