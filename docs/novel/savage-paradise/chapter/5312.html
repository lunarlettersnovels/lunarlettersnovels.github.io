            <p><strong>Chapter 27.1</strong></p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun fears his father. Perhaps even more than Goyo.</p>
<p>His desire for Goyo remained unfulfilled because of Lee Yi-taek.</p>
<p>“Heh, pfft.”</p>
<p>Goyo let out a bitter laugh. Lee Yoon-gun had always been aroused thinking about her, releasing those urges with other women.</p>
<p>Today would be no different. He had manipulated her into coming to the hospital and held another woman in front of her, likely hoping to mentally shock her.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, she felt nothing.</p>
<p>“You’re laughing? Did you just laugh? Damn bitch, answer me!”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun struck her cheek again. Her delicate cheek quickly swelled and turned bright red.</p>
<p>“My partner was chosen by the Congressman.”</p>
<p>She entered the hotel room with Kwon Jae-heon on Lee Yi-taek’s instructions and was intimate. Unlike Yoon-gun, who switched women for his own pleasure, Goyo didn’t even have the right to love someone of her own choosing.</p>
<p>“Among the candidates were Kwon Jae-heon, Park Jung-hoon, Han Yoon-woo. And do you know who else? Kwon Moo-young, the man of the woman you dated a month ago.”</p>
<p>“…Damn!”</p>
<p>“Who do you think I slept with?”</p>
<p>The reason for his outburst was obvious. Unable to challenge his father, he was taking it out on the more vulnerable Goyo.</p>
<p>‘If you give in to a child’s tantrum, you’ll only spoil their behavior.’</p>
<p>Just like Kwon Jae-heon said, he looked like nothing more than a child throwing a fit.</p>
<p>“What would change if I told you?”</p>
<p>A rich madman who casually tells her to throw away a 1 billion won necklace. You slept with a man you wouldn’t dare approach, so what could you possibly do?</p>
<p>“Tell me! Which bastard’s s*xual fluids did dad tell you to receive!”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun’s mind was completely filled with thoughts of Goyo betraying and cheating on him.</p>
<p>‘Would he go crazy if I said I slept with Kwon Jae-heon who treated me like a dog?’</p>
<p>She was exhausted.</p>
<p>He had begged and cried for Kwon Jae-heon not to hit him, so why was he hurting her?</p>
<p>“Please… stop…”</p>
<p>Everyone becomes insignificant in the face of merciless violence. All one can do is curl up and squirm like an insect.</p>
<p>“Stop. It hurts, it hurts!”</p>
<p>They say humans are creatures of adaptation. But violence was something one never truly got used to, no matter how much time passed.</p>
<p>With each shocking blow that made her ears ring, her body swayed. A woman’s scream could be heard from somewhere.</p>
<p>“Damn it, you keep doing things to get hit!”</p>
<p>“Kaaak, kaak!”</p>
<p>Though Goyo was the one being beaten, the woman on the bed had wide eyes and was screaming.</p>
<p>The woman, shocked by Yoon-gun’s madness, picked up her fallen clothes and backed away. Though she had just been intimate with him moments ago, Yoon-gun paid her no attention.</p>
<p>His focus was entirely on Goyo. His eyes were fixed on her swollen lips and delicate neck, marked with kisses from another man.</p>
<p>“Lee Goyo, you’ll sleep with any man just because dad says so? Damn.”</p>
<p>“Stop! Stop it!”</p>
<p>Goyo raised her voice out of frustration, but Yoon-gun continued only with his own words.</p>
<p>“Lee Goyo, want to hear an interesting story?”</p>
<p>“I, I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t listen now, you’ll regret it. Listen while I’m willing to tell you, before I change my mind.”</p>
<p>“N-no.”</p>
<p>Even as Goyo shook her head, Yoon-gun did not stop.</p>
<p>“Goyo, when a prosecutor is corrupt, he can create crimes that don’t exist. Hehe, I don’t know if he properly closed his eyes out of injustice. Only the dead are pitiful, right?”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun began laughing maniacally, speaking incomprehensible words while shaking his body. Goyo, whose hair was gripped in his hand, was also shaken back and forth.</p>
<p>“Stop it!”</p>
<p>“Foolish girl. Acting all high and mighty without knowing what’s truth and what’s a lie.”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun’s giggling laughter made Goyo’s entire body break out in goosebumps. She didn’t want to hear his nonsense anymore.</p>
<p>Her body hurt, but her heart hurt even more. She felt ashamed of her own powerlessness, and the reality she couldn’t change was miserable.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>*<em>“Damn.”</em>*</p>
<p>At the sudden voice, Goyo flinched. It was a voice that should never be heard in this place.</p>
<p>Beyond the wide-open hospital room door stood Kwon Jae-heon. And at his feet, a barely clothed woman sat collapsed on the floor. She had been trying to hurriedly dress and escape when she collided with Kwon Jae-heon, who had been standing outside, and fell.</p>
<p>“Who… Who the hell are you…?”</p>
<p>The woman glared and shrieked, but as soon as she met Kwon Jae-heon’s chilling gaze, she immediately shut her mouth. She was quick-witted. In an atmosphere where it felt like someone might end up dead, she knew better than to let her mouth run carelessly.</p>
<p>“Looks like I came at a bad time.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon brushed off his shoulder where the woman had bumped into him and glanced inside the hospital room.</p>
<p>The woman rolled her eyes frantically, trying to assess her situation. The conclusion came swiftly.</p>
<p>*<em>‘Run.’</em>*</p>
<p>She wisely decided that trying to understand more or exchanging words with anyone here was a reckless move. Leaving this place as quickly as possible seemed to be the best way to keep herself safe.</p>
<p>She scrambled to her feet and bolted without so much as a glance back. She hadn’t even managed to put on her shoes properly.</p>
<p>And that choice was the right one. Kwon Jae-heon didn’t spare her a single glance, and Lee Yoon-gun had already erased her existence from his mind.</p>
