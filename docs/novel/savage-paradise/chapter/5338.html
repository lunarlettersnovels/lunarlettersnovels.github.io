            <p><strong>Chapter 13.1</strong></p>
<p>“Thought you were the winning bid and were about to enjoy yourself, huh…” Jae-heon’s voice was dripping with annoyance.</p>
<p>“Is the auction still ongoing?”</p>
<p>Goyo couldn’t give a definite answer to his question. The person determining the final bid wasn’t Goyo, but Yi-taek.</p>
<p>Even now, if Yi-taek ordered her to leave the hotel, Goyo would have no choice but to comply. She was tethered to him, unable to assert herself. No matter if she spent the night with Jae-heon, Yi-taek wouldn’t let her go.</p>
<p>“This situation is messed up,” Jae-heon muttered, frustration evident in his voice.</p>
<p>He couldn’t shake the image of Yi-taek’s face, smirking as he sent Goyo over. It was like offering her up for a taste, but knowing that if Jae-heon tried to return for more, he’d have to participate in an expensive auction.</p>
<p>Money wasn’t the problem. Plenty of men would eagerly participate in an auction for a woman like Goyo, but losing there would be a blow to his pride that he couldn’t endure.</p>
<p>With a smirk, Jae-heon inquired, “Aside from me, who else is participating?”</p>
<p>Silence followed as Goyo recalled the individuals suggested by Yi-taek.</p>
<p>Among them was Jae-heon’s biological father. He had threatened to send her to his father’s harem if she failed to seduce Jae-heon. It was implied that she could become involved in a clandestine relationship with the man before her, exchanging heated breaths.</p>
<p>“Seonjo Daily’s Park Jung-hoon.”</p>
<p>The man who had been sitting beside Goyo at the auction, attempting to charm her. However, witnessing her leave with Jae-heon, it was unlikely that she would have any further contact or meetings with him.</p>
<p>“I’m better than a divorced man.”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon, a womanizer.</p>
<p>Park likes beautiful women. Even though he says it’s love at first sight, he clearly has feelings for Goyo.</p>
<p>“That a*shole and his age difference.”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon is thirty-two. Hearing him mutter, Igoyo recalled Kwon Jae-heon’s age. She thought Kwon Jae-heon and Park Jung-hoon were the same age…</p>
<p>“There was also the son of Chairman Han at the banquet.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Lee Goyo tried hard to hide her surprise.</p>
<p>Whether he had read her mind or just knew a lot about Lee Yi-taek, Jae-heon listed the names of those Lee Yi-taek had specifically mentioned.</p>
<p>“Han Yoon-woo’s partner… was it Eun-seo or Eun-jin? Anyway, they must be busy having s*x by now.”</p>
<p>For someone like Goyo, bewitching Han Yoon-woo would be a piece of cake. If Goyo just made contact, he would ditch his girl even in the middle of s*x and come running.</p>
<p>Jae-heon clicked his tongue and muttered. Goyo was dumbfounded. It was ironic coming from someone who had brought actress Ji Seo-hyun along only to send her away and stay with Goyo.</p>
<p>“As long as she’s not sent as a concubine to our old man, I guess it’s fortunate.”</p>
<p>“H-how did you…?”</p>
<p>When Kwon Moo-young was mentioned, Goyo couldn’t hide her bewildered expression. Seeing Goyo with her mouth open in surprise made Kwon Jae-heon’s brow furrow deeply.</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>He laughed for a while as if he had heard something amusing.</p>
<p>“Hmph, that was just a wild guess.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Were you planning to go to the old man if I refused?”</p>
<p>His expression turned grim.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon had never felt so dumbfounded and outraged in his life. No matter how much money was needed for an election or how much a man liked women, considering someone old enough to be her grandfather was outrageous.</p>
<p>“Crazy bastard.”</p>
<p>Goyo wasn’t sure if his muttered curse was directed at Lee Yi-taek or Kwon Moo-young.</p>
<p>“How much are you trying to raise your price?”</p>
<p>Something seemed to bother him as Jae-heon raised one corner of his mouth in a sneer.</p>
<p>The more people participated in the auction, the higher the price would go. If the auctioned item were worthless, no one would care, but Goyo was perfectly his type from head to toe. With her appearance, any man’s preferences could change in an instant.</p>
<p>‘Is he planning to squeeze me dry?’</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s head ached at the thought of Lee Yi-taek’s intention not to let Goyo go easily.</p>
<p>“You know well how much I’m worth.”</p>
<p>Even though it’s her own worth, she can’t determine it herself. Depending on who calls, it could cost tens of billions or just tens of thousands of won.</p>
<p>Goyo is just one of the pieces strategically placed on Lee Yi-taek’s board. Lee Yi-taek was someone who hid a cruel blade behind a benevolent smile, and Goyo had no skill to betray him.</p>
<p>“My old man may be a womanizer, but he has his limits.”</p>
<p>He hasn’t touched girls younger than his children. Not until now.</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young had spent his life with beautiful women, but he didn’t want to embarrass himself in front of his children. He drew his own line. But isn’t the law meant to be broken?</p>
<p>That’s how difficult a woman like Goyo found it to dismiss, “Perhaps this time, I might truly cross the line…”</p>
