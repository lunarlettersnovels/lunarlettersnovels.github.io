            <p><strong>Chapter 10.2</strong></p>
<p>A month ago, when he first met Lee Goyo, he hadn’t been himself then either.</p>
<p>They first met while he was punishing Lee Yoon-gun, and Goyo entered the suite. She had stood at the entrance, staring at him with an unreadable expression, just like tonight.</p>
<p>Her unadorned face, loose-knit sweater, and jeans caught his eye. As the rumors said, she was as beautiful as a doll and just as cold.</p>
<p>“Ah, fuck! It hurts so much… Ah, ah!”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Y-you should have protected me!”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun clung to Lee Goyo, fervently claiming her as his own, then started to cry pitifully. Despite his words, he was whining and clutching at her pants, which made Jae-heon smirk. It had been a while since he had seen someone so dense that even after a beating, they couldn’t get their act together.</p>
<p>It seemed like this wasn’t the first time Goyo had to clean up Lee Yoon-gun’s mess. Her voice was filled with resignation as she tried to calm him down, akin to a nanny dealing with a troublesome child.</p>
<p>‘I wonder if Lee Yoon-gun knows.’</p>
<p>That Lee Yi-taek, instead of suing Jae-heon for assaulting Lee Yoon-gun, had sent Goyo as a sacrificial lamb.</p>
<p>Even beautifully packaged.</p>
<p>“You need to answer, baby.”</p>
<p>The answer was already determined. At some point, it wasn’t Goyo who was anxious, but Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>He wondered if she would still be cold when he held her. Thinking about how she might look, disheveled beneath him, made him swell with anticipation. Noticing his growing arousal, Goyo spoke with a troubled expression.</p>
<p>“I’m not like Ji Seo-hyun.”</p>
<p>She was sure to be compared. Kwon Jae-heon seemed experienced enough to speak dirty words, while she was completely inexperienced casually.</p>
<p>“It won’t be fun.”</p>
<p>There was no way an inexperienced person like her could satisfy a man as seasoned as Jae-heon. As he put it, how could she compete with Ji Seo-hyun, who was so experienced that Jae-heon put a ridiculous bid on a jewel for her?</p>
<p>At least Goyo knew her place.</p>
<p>“…Congressman Yi-taek said I needed to make an impression on you.”</p>
<p>It was a losing battle, anyway. If that was the case, was there really a need to continue down this path? Perhaps it was better to delay the confrontation, even if it meant facing some criticism.</p>
<p>“I’ve made quite an impression already…”</p>
<p>Goyo flashed a smile. It was the refined smile that Lee Yi-taek always emphasized, one that wasn’t vulgar but dignified.</p>
<p>“So you’re leaving?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>If Kwon Jae-heon hadn’t extended his hand to her first at the auction, it could have been troublesome. Many people had seen the two of them together, so Goyo could explain herself to Lee Yi-taek.</p>
<p>“That statement probably didn’t mean just showing your face.”</p>
<p>“…My family is very strict.”</p>
<p>Goyo clutched her bag tightly to her chest.</p>
<p>Bzzz, bzzz. Her phone, which had been vibrating at intervals for the past few minutes, was buzzing again. She didn’t need to check to know who was calling.</p>
<p>‘It’s probably Lee Yoon-gun.’</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek would have already been informed that she had gone up to the hotel with Kwon Jae-heon, so he had no reason to call. But Lee Yoon-gun was different.</p>
<p>He harassed her constantly, almost like a jealous husband. Although she had bought some time by using the excuse of being with Lee Yi-taek, she couldn’t hold off his impatience for long.</p>
<p>“Hah, since when has your family been strict?”</p>
<p>Knowing about Lee Yoon-gun’s misdeeds, Jae-heon found her statement ridiculous.</p>
<p>His reaction was understandable, but Goyo’s situation was different from that of the unruly Lee Yoon-gun. She had been raised strictly without ever having been touched by a man—at least until today.</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s irritated gaze shifted to her bag, where the persistent vibration of the phone was coming from.</p>
<p>“You might not believe me, but…”</p>
<p>Goyo was more concerned about Lee Yoon-gun, who pestered her daily than about Kwon Jae-heon, whom she might not see again. She knew that Lee Yoon-gun would throw a fit if she didn’t answer his calls promptly, given his dog-like temper.</p>
