            <p><strong>Chapter 7.1</strong></p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon called out six hundred million.</p>
<p>“Damn it…”</p>
<p>The man beside Goyo muttered a low curse and quickly turned his head.</p>
<p>Glaring at Kwon Jae-heon, who had bid six hundred million, he furrowed his brows and raised the bid by another fifty million. Then, without a second of hesitation, Kwon Jae-heon raised the bid to seven hundred million.</p>
<p>The man cursed Kwon Jae-heon and grudgingly called out seven hundred and fifty million.</p>
<p>“It’s not even something you need,” Goyo said to him.</p>
<p>“Why do you think that?”</p>
<p>Didn’t he just say he didn’t understand why someone would like that item?</p>
<p>As Goyo squinted, not understanding the man’s behavior, the man shrugged as if it was no big deal. Then, as if reading Goyo’s expression, he smiled and said,</p>
<p>“I just don’t want that guy to have anything.”</p>
<p>“Eight hundred million.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s calm voice echoed through the auction house.</p>
<p>Goyo moved his gaze forward, hearing the voice closer than before. Jae-heon had turned his head, staring at her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>How long has he been looking at me?</p>
<p>“He’s been looking at you like that… for quite a while.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I just found another reason why I absolutely can’t let this go.”</p>
<p>It made him even more stubborn.</p>
<p>The man twitched and lifted the corners of his mouth. Then, he briskly called out eight hundred and fifty million.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s face seemed to scrunch up subtly, then he raised the diamond bid to nine hundred million.</p>
<p>What in the world turned this into a battle of pride between the two men? As the man and Kwon Jae-heon alternated their bids, the necklace’s price kept climbing.</p>
<p>Other people, seemingly having given up on winning this auction, watched the two men’s rivalry with keen interest.</p>
<p>Goyo was becoming increasingly uncomfortable. The people in the auction house were directing their gazes not at the two men but more at Ji Seo-hyun, who was sitting next to him and himself. They had curious smiles as if they understood the reason for the heated competition.</p>
<p>“I’ll definitely win the bid and give it to you as a gift.”</p>
<p>“To me? Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m interested in you.”</p>
<p>Judging by his attire, he didn’t seem like an ordinary person.</p>
<p>How wealthy must one be to gift a multi-billion-won necklace to a woman of interest casually?</p>
<p>It had been 14 years since Goyo left the shabby basement and received Lee Yi-taek’s sponsorship. She thought she had adapted to the spending habits and consumption of the upper class, but it seemed she still had a long way to go.</p>
<p>“I’m not a strange person. Ah, wait a moment… nine hundred and fifty million.” The man proudly said his bid.</p>
<p>Goyo squinted her eyes and studied the man beside her, “You don’t need to say anything; I know who you are.”</p>
<p>She muttered as she listened to the man calling out the unrealistic amount.</p>
<p>“You know me?”</p>
<p>The man looked at Goyo. Goyo sighed and softly said, “We’ve met before.”</p>
<p>His face was familiar. After talking and looking at him for a while, she finally remembered.</p>
<p>“When did we meet? I couldn’t possibly forget such a beauty…”</p>
<p>“At a wedding.”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon, the vice president and eldest son of Park Won-ho, the chairman of Seongjo Daily.</p>
<p>Should she consider herself lucky? He was one of the men Lee Yi-taek had told her to get close to.</p>
<p>“What? A w-wedding? Whose wedding?”</p>
<p>The man’s expression cracked. Looking at her in disbelief, Goyo drove the point home.</p>
<p>“At Executive Director Park’s wedding.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It’s understandable if you don’t remember. I was a guest on the bride’s side.”</p>
<p>“Cough, cough.”</p>
<p>He cleared his throat as if he had choked.</p>
<p>At sixteen, shortly before graduating middle school, Goyo had attended Lee Yi-taek’s niece’s wedding. The groom at that wedding had been Park Jung-hoon.</p>
<p>It was clear that Park Jung-hoon didn’t recognize the woman sitting next to him. If he had known, he would never have tried such a move. Nothing good would come from entangling with his ex-wife.</p>
<p>“Any more bids? …Yes, ten billion… Sold.”</p>
<p>“What? Oh!”</p>
<p>While Park Jung-hoon was still stunned by Goyo’s words, the auctioneer struck the gavel.</p>
<p>When the necklace was finally awarded to Kwon Jae-heon, Ji Seo-hyun’s face lit up with a bright smile. However, the smile quickly vanished from her face as she looked at Kwon Jae-heon, who was directing his gaze not at her but at another woman.</p>
<p>“I was so surprised… I forgot we were in the middle of an auction.”</p>
<p>The once smooth and relaxed voice now shook uncontrollably.</p>
<p>“I-I’m not having an affair or anything like that, so please don’t misunderstand…”</p>
<p>“I’m not misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>Goyo responded calmly to Park Jung-hoon’s words.</p>
<p>To Lee Yi-taek, Park Jung-hoon was just his deceased wife’s nephew-in-law, so he only attended family events out of obligation. This was the first time Goyo had seen him since the wedding.</p>
<p>“I heard about your divorce about an hour ago.”</p>
