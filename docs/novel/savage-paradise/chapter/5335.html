            <p><strong>Chapter 14.2</strong></p>
<p>‘I was locked up with Yoon-gun oppa.’</p>
<p>‘I was scared.’</p>
<p>‘I’m happy to have a brother and a father.’</p>
<p>At that time, she didn’t understand the weight of those words.</p>
<p>‘Goyo, you’re a liar who deceived the entire nation. If the fact that you’re not a kidnapping victim but a kidnapper’s daughter is revealed, you won’t be able to live in Korea.’</p>
<p>In the secret safe in his study, Lee Yi-taek kept items left by Goyo’s biological father. Lee Yi-taek regularly threatened her with this, ensuring she couldn’t have any other thoughts.</p>
<p>He often said that if those materials were released to the media, not only would the world hate her, but even her biological mother, wherever she might be, would despise her. Lee Yi-taek thus turned Goyo into a puppet, a marionette he could control as he wished.</p>
<p>In the end, Goyo brainwashed herself into believing that being called a ‘brainless idiot’ or an ‘empty-headed bitch’ was better than being stigmatized as the daughter of a criminal and being pointed at.</p>
<p>Even now, she had nightmares. She was terrified and scared that the truth about her being a kidnapper’s daughter might come out.</p>
<p>“What I wanted…”</p>
<p>Was only a free life.</p>
<p>But no matter how much she struggled, there was no way to escape this hell by her own strength. As long as she was Lee Chul-woo’s daughter and Lee Yi-taek held that weakness, she had no choice but to live as Lee Yi-taek’s puppet.</p>
<p>Unable to defy her fate, Goyo thought only about surviving.</p>
<p>‘Just like now.’</p>
<p>She was in a hotel room, trying to win the heart of Kwon Jae-heon, as Lee Yi-taek desired.</p>
<p>‘I expected something like this would happen.’</p>
<p>She didn’t know when that time would come.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she didn’t find Kwon Jae-heon utterly repulsive. She never hoped for a love that would make her heart race; being with someone who didn’t disgust her was enough.</p>
<p>“Who’s the guy in your mind?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon, like a ghost, sensed that she was thinking of something else.</p>
<p>“Who are you thinking about so wistfully?”</p>
<p>“…You, sir.”</p>
<p>Goyo lowered her gaze. The bag on the floor was still vibrating.</p>
<p>That detestable Lee Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do? Your father sent me here. What power do I have?</p>
<p>“Should I play along?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon wrapped his arm around her slim waist and pulled her closer. He tilted his head, narrowing the distance between them. Their faces were so close that the tips of their noses almost touched.</p>
<p>“Baby, I’ll pay the highest price for you, so don’t think about anything else.”</p>
<p>The heat from Jae-heon’s lips clung to hers.</p>
<p>“If you want, I’ll even kill someone for you, okay?”</p>
<p>Before she knew it, Jae-heon’s lips were covering Goyo’s. He sucked her tightly closed lower lip into his mouth and bit down hard.</p>
<p>A muffled groan escaped her lips, and as they parted, his tongue roughly pushed its way inside. The sound of their tongues intertwining mixed with their heated breaths.</p>
<p>“Ahh, mm.”</p>
<p>Their tightly sealed lips exchanged hot breaths.</p>
<p>His tongue toyed with the inside of Goyo’s mouth, brushing against her gums, wrapping around her tongue, and pulling it in.</p>
<p>Jae-heon strengthened his grip on the back of Goyo’s head, making her look directly into his eyes. His fierce gaze filled her vision.</p>
<p>“Spread your legs only for me,” he growled, a primal warning dripping from his lips.</p>
<p>I won’t be a pawn in the Congressman’s absurd schemes, he resolved. Regardless of Lee Yi-taek’s plans, Jae-heon had his own agenda now.</p>
<p>“Ha… Hah…”</p>
<p>His hot tongue probed her mouth, then raced through her head, now with hurtful words. His ridiculous command tickled the pit of her stomach and made her legs weak.</p>
<p>There was no time to spare, not for her, but for Jae-heon’s behavior.</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s hand went to the small of her back. With a single touch, her dress came off. As if he was skilled at this, he easily unclasped her bra.</p>
<p>The bra that had been squeezing her bre*sts disappeared, revealing her beautifully perky peaks. Jae-heon grabbed them, circling and tugging at her nipples with a familiar touch.</p>
<p>“Ah, let’s go inside,” Goyo clung to his shoulders with a blushing face. She wanted to leave the lobby, if not the bedroom. Behind the iron gate blocking her way was just the hallway. Passersby could hear their moans.</p>
<p>“I respect your preference.”</p>
<p>“My preference?”</p>
<p>Goyo had to think about what she had just heard. Kwon Jae-heon raised an eyebrow and smirked.</p>
<p>“You’ve been standing on the porch for 35 minutes, so I figured it was your preference.”</p>
<p>“Is that… right?”</p>
<p>Confusion flooded her. They were in a luxury suite that cost millions of won per night; there was no reason to prefer the lobby. At first, she stood there because of her pride, and now he kept her from moving.</p>
<p>However, there was no way to refute his nonsense. Jae-heon’s hand, which had been mocking her nipples, had already slid down her concave abdomen and into her thin silk panties.</p>
<p>“W-What are you… Ahh…!”</p>
<p>Since the moment they kissed, everything below was already in a moist state of arousal. His fingers headed for her parted slit and unabashedly explored the damp crevice, sending waves of pleasure coursing through her body.</p>
