            <p><strong>Chapter 38.2</strong></p>
<p>Lee Goyo had once snapped and confronted Lee Yoon-gun, the man who relentlessly pushed her to the edge.</p>
<p>In front of Lee Yoon-gun, she had deleted the messages and shouted at him to never send such filthy things again. But Yoon-gun had just stared at her, sneering as though it was a joke.</p>
<p>‘What you want to delete is probably me. What are you going to do about it? You can’t win against me.’</p>
<p>‘You, Goyo, are no match for me. You’ll do what I say. Bark when I tell you to bark. You don’t understand because you’re speaking like a human? Woof, woof.’</p>
<p>‘You should bark too, Goyo. Try it. Woof! Woof!’</p>
<p>‘Why aren’t you barking? Try this. Growl, grr! Grrr, woof woof!’</p>
<p>[Woof woof]</p>
<p>[Growl]</p>
<p>[Woof woof]</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun had gleefully sent voice messages full of dog-like sounds. No matter how many times she deleted them, new ones would pile up faster. Her desperate efforts were futile. As she helplessly watched, Yoon-gun laughed maniacally.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I didn’t try, I did, but it didn’t work.”</p>
<p>Even if she fought back, it was a reality she couldn’t change, so she had given up.</p>
<p>“If you were going to do something, you should’ve done it properly. So they’d never dare to come at you again.”</p>
<p>The smoke drifted from his teeth in a long, slow stream.</p>
<p>“You’re trembling over breaking a phone? I can tell what that means.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just about the phone. She had fought back, willing to die, but it hadn’t worked. Goyo barely managed to swallow the words rising in her throat.</p>
<p>Suddenly, memories from four years ago surfaced. That day, too, Lee Yoon-gun had started hitting her over something trivial. Fearing for her life, she fought back fiercely. She grabbed a cutter knife and threatened him to stay away.</p>
<p>But Lee Yoon-gun had taken the knife from her without a second thought and slashed his wrist in front of her.</p>
<p>There was no hesitation in his actions. Blood poured from his wrist, and he sneered at her, saying, “You can’t die. Only someone like me can hurt myself like this.”</p>
<p>After that, Lee Yoon-gun had a snake tattooed on his wrist, its mouth wide open to resemble a serpent ready to strike. He frequently flaunted the tattoo, shaking his wrist in front of Goyo to mock and taunt her.</p>
<p>It was like trying to hit a rock with an egg. She could never defeat the venom he carried.</p>
<p>Before resigning herself to the situation, Goyo had struggled many times, each attempt leading to failure. And with each failure, painful consequences followed. Eventually, she gave up on her meaningless defiance that led nowhere.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t intentional, but I did get a bit worked up. But I won’t apologize.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon took a deep drag on his cigarette, pulling it all the way to the filter, then exhaled a long stream of smoke. The thick, stagnant air quickly became heavy with the scent of tobacco.</p>
<p>“I broke your phone, so I’ll take responsibility and get you a new one. I’ll also change the number—hope that’s okay with you.”</p>
<p>“Do as you please.”</p>
<p>Changing the number wasn’t much of a problem. The only people who would complain about not being able to reach her were the two of them.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about Lee Yoon-gun. I plan to break his remaining hand as well.”</p>
<p>So that he can’t even lay a finger on you.</p>
<p>Jae-heon flicked the ash off his cigarette, continuing.</p>
<p>“If you want, I can kill him for you.”</p>
<p>Despite the deadly words, a soft curve appeared on his lips.</p>
<p>“That’s fine with me.”</p>
<p>Goyo weakly shook her head.</p>
<p>Ordinary people gossip when they dislike someone, but they don’t think about killing them, even if the person is the worst human being imaginable.</p>
<p>“Killing him is simple.”</p>
<p>“But killing him is not okay.”</p>
<p>Goyo didn’t want to make someone else a murderer for her own desires. She also felt guilty about Lee Yoon-gun. After all, he had gotten his disability because of her father, which had twisted him even further, and she felt sorry for him.</p>
<p>“Are you being blackmailed by Lee Yoon-gun? Did you borrow money from him, or maybe your biological father is a murderer?”</p>
<p>His words pierced through the haze of smoke and struck her heart.</p>
