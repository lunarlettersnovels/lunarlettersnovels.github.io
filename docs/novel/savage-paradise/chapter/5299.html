            <p><strong>Chapter 34.1</strong></p>
<p>Goyo watched the argument between Park Jung-hoon and Kwon Jae-heon in silence. And somehow, she felt like Kwon Jae-heon was protecting her. If he hadn’t appeared at the hospital that morning, she would be the one hospitalized, not Lee Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>“You, did you come here to harass me because I published the article?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon’s face was red with anger. Was he doing this to provoke her?</p>
<p>“No, I came here because you exposed the crime I was trying to hide, and now you’re trying to get revenge.”</p>
<p>“What’s the big deal about a newspaper article?”</p>
<p>“You’re insulting our newspaper!”</p>
<p>The two men had attended the same private elementary, middle, and high schools, which were known to be popular among the children of the upper class. Being the same age, people often compared them.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon received admiration and praise for his exceptional abilities, while Park Jung-hoon, who was slightly inferior to his parents’ reputation, received sympathetic comments and glances. As a result, Park Jung-hoon’s inferiority complex deepened over time.</p>
<p>It was the same now.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon had caused a scandal, and Park Jung-hoon had published an article about it, making it a front-page story on the social news section. Yet, Kwon Jae-heon was still calm and even asked what the problem was. He was so shameless that Park Jung-hoon, who had published the article, was starting to doubt himself.</p>
<p>“What’s with all these idiots who don’t know how to talk?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon had never been hesitant with his words, even from a young age. What made him think he was so great?</p>
<p>“…If you didn’t follow me here, how did you know I was here?”</p>
<p>“I told you, I came here for a meeting.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t! You didn’t say that!”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon’s face turned red with anger.</p>
<p>“Fine, listen carefully. I came here for a meeting. Are you satisfied now?”</p>
<p>You’re having a meeting in a place like this?”</p>
<p>“I suppose you should ask her. She’s the one who chose the meeting location.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon nodded towards Goyo, and her head turned first.</p>
<p>The woman had been catching his eye since earlier. She was a refined beauty in her mid-to-late 30s, sitting alone at the next table, sipping coffee. It seemed like she was waiting for someone.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t seem interested in Kwon Jae-heon, despite having a meeting with him. Her gaze, which was elegantly sipping coffee, was actually directed at Park Jung-hoon.</p>
<p>“No meeting, you just came here to meet a woman. Who is it this time…? Huh?” She said.</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon turned his body around to see the woman Kwon Jae-heon was pointing at. When their eyes met, she smiled slyly at Park Jung-hoon. It was an unsettling smile, like she was saying, “Park Jung-hoon, you’re dead to me.”</p>
<p>The chill of that smile was reminiscent of the smile Kwon Jae-heon had when he beat Lee Yoon-gun that morning. And as if to prove Goyo’s ominous feeling, Park Jung-hoon’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>“S-sister? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon asked, looking stunned. The answer came from Kwon Jae-heon’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Taehan Hotel coffee is to your taste, isn’t it, Director Park? I have my ways.”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible.”</p>
<p>“Looks like you didn’t know you and your sister share the same coffee taste.”</p>
<p>“Do you know when my sister started liking coffee? And how did she even get in here? You need a reservation to get in.”</p>
<p>He was asking the same questions as Goyo, despite being an adult. Just like Kwon Jae-heon, the president of Sungjo Daily, she could go anywhere she wanted if she just wanted to.</p>
<p>“When did my sister start liking coffee? She only drinks tea, doesn’t she?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon repeated the same words, looking shocked, as if he couldn’t believe that his sister and Kwon Jae-heon shared the same coffee taste.</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to realize that his sister might have chosen this location as an excuse because of his own actions. It was pitiful to see the president of Sungjo Daily, Park Seo-hwa, suffering because of his thoughtless and immature brother.</p>
<p>“No, I mean, why is my sister meeting you?”</p>
<p>“Why else? Your sister, the president of Sungjo Daily, has come to clean up the mess you made.”</p>
<p>The fact that his sister, Park Seo-hwa, the de facto owner of Sungjo Daily, had stepped in implied that their father, Park Won-ho, the chairman of the Sungjo Media Group, also shared the same intention. To clean Park Jung-hoon’s mess.</p>
<p>“I’m stuck dealing with my brother’s mess, and I don’t even have time for a relationship.”</p>
