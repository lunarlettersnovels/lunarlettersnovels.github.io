            <p><strong>Chapter 50.2</strong></p>
<p>‘The Congressman is too busy to follow me around, and Yoon-gun must still be too uncomfortable to move.’</p>
<p>Aside from the Yi-taek family, there was no one who would harm her. This was nothing short of overprotection.</p>
<p>‘This too shall pass.’</p>
<p>Once the interest fades, the protection will disappear as well, so she decided to take it easy. Right now, he probably just wanted to give her everything. She wanted to accept everything he offered, as it was a luxury she had never experienced in her life.</p>
<p>“It’s only been a week.”</p>
<p>It had only been a week. It was surprising that it had only been that long. Considering the number of times they had sex, it felt like they had been together for a year.</p>
<p>She couldn’t even count how many times they had intertwined their bodies in just a week. Was sex always this frequent? Four or five times a night. Until dawn. Was this normal?</p>
<p>“Thanks to that, I haven’t been able to do any volunteer work this year.”</p>
<p>On the table was a piano-shaped piggy bank with a sticker indicating that the money would be used for donations to the less fortunate. Seeing it reminded her of the social welfare facilities she used to visit with the Yi-taek family every year.</p>
<p>‘I wonder if the Congressman participated alone.’</p>
<p>She didn’t think Yoon-gun would have gone.</p>
<p>With various thoughts swirling in her head, Goyo leaned over the table and pressed the keys of the piano piggy bank. Although it was a model, pressing the keys produced electronic sounds.</p>
<p>Ding ding, dang dang, ding ding ding.</p>
<p>When she went to the orphanage, she used to play the piano, which she couldn’t play well, while playing with the children. At the nursing home, she would help bathe the elderly women who had difficulty moving.</p>
<p>Everything changed after meeting Kwon Jae-heon. She was doing things she had never done before and dreaming of things she had never even imagined.</p>
<p>Ding ding, dang…</p>
<p>Goyo suddenly stopped her fingers on the model keys, gripped by a wave of anxiety.</p>
<p>She felt worried and fearful about her situation. It felt like she was enjoying a festival with a predetermined end.</p>
<p>She hoped the ending wouldn’t be ugly. She just wanted to return to her daily life with only beautiful memories, without any scars.</p>
<p>No, it was too late.</p>
<p>This brief taste of peace was too sweet, and she didn’t want to go back to her old life.</p>
<p>“I hope this festival doesn’t end.”</p>
<p>Goyo turned her gaze out the window.</p>
<p>More and more snowflakes brushed against the window. Like fireworks decorating the end of a festival, like paper confetti flying in the air after a concert. The world was gradually fading to white.</p>
<p>“I never thought of Director Kwon like this; he’s quite something.”</p>
<p>As she was lost in thought while looking outside, a strange voice interrupted her. Turning her head, she saw bodyguards blocking a woman.</p>
<p>The automatic glass door of the waiting room slid shut, indicating that the woman had just entered. The bodyguards seemed to have abruptly blocked her path.</p>
<p>“It’s interesting that there are people blocking my way. Ha, do you know who I am?”</p>
<p>She glared at the bodyguards with a cold gaze.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, but who are you?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you know who I am? If you’re going to provide security, you should be able to distinguish between friend and foe. Did your boss tell you to be on high alert without reason?”</p>
<p>She let out a cynical laugh. After chuckling, she raised her chin and said,</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m Park Seo-hwa from Seongjo Daily. My title is Executive Director. Do I need to say more?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Upon confirming who she was, the bodyguards slightly bowed their heads and stepped back a pace.</p>
<p>“It would be better if you waited outside the door. Since it’s a transparent glass door, you can see everything inside, so is there really a need to be uncomfortable and stay in here?”</p>
<p>“We act according to our orders. No matter how much of a representative you are from Seongjo Daily, that fact doesn’t change.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like being followed around by bodyguards. I absolutely hate being watched by others. I’m the one who’s uncomfortable, you know! Still, you won’t let me out?”</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa pointed to the door with her finger, issuing an order for them to leave. However, when the bodyguards didn’t budge, her tone became harsher.</p>
<p>“Are your heads just for show? I’ve already revealed who I am. At the very least, you should have realized I’m not someone to be on guard against.”</p>
<p>As her voice rose, the expressions of the bodyguards grew increasingly stiff. It was clear they were trying to endure because their opponent was the representative of Seongjo Daily.</p>
