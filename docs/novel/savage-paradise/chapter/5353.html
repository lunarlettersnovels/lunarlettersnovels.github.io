            <p><strong>Chapter 5.2</strong></p>
<p>He is the only son of Kwon Moo-young, the loan shark with the most cash in South Korea. The name KJ Financial, under which Kwon Jae-heon is the CEO, is merely a front for their legal business; their foundation is loan sharking.</p>
<p>They are an organization that has risen to its current position more through illegality than legality, more through threats and violence than negotiations. They pretend to be businessmen in public, but behind the scenes, they don’t hesitate to commit murder.</p>
<p>Goyo bit her lower lip as she thought of Lee Yoon-gun, who was still lying in the hospital.</p>
<p>“If my father came here, you’d be dumped in the water over there, do you understand me?</p>
<p>It was no empty threat. The only reason Lee Yoon-gun was still alive was because Kwon Jae-heon, unlike his father, presented a façade of running a legitimate business. If his father had come himself or if Lee Yoon-gun weren’t Lee Yi-taek’s son, it wouldn’t have ended with just six weeks of recovery.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a pleasant meeting… as you probably know.”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s better than not knowing anything at all.”</p>
<p>Absolutely not.</p>
<p>As Goyo recalled the screams, blood, and the scent of blood mixed together from that time, she felt goosebumps all over her body and cold sweat running down her back. It felt like she was being dragged back to the slaughterhouse once again, like a cow being led to slaughter.</p>
<p>Regardless of Goyo’s circumstances, Lee Yi-taek seemed to have no animosity towards Kwon Jae-heon, who had lynched his son. If anything, he seemed to consider it fortunate to have such a connection. It was feasible, considering Lee Yi-taek valued his desires more than his own son.</p>
<p>“Tsk, because there’s no woman to entertain…”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek furrowed his brow as if recalling an incident from a month ago.</p>
<p>The woman who accompanied Lee Yoon-gun to Cheongdo was Min Jei, the curator of the KJ Art Gallery, whom Kwon Moo-young valued greatly. Due to his son’s extravagant affairs with women, Lee Yi-taek’s lifelong ambitions were on the verge of collapse. Even if he chose a partner to have an affair with, he couldn’t understand why he chose her.</p>
<p>“Now, there’s no one else I can trust but you.”</p>
<p>No one doing business in Korea, directly or indirectly, hadn’t received money or favors from Kwon Moo-young. Preventing a loan could cause a company to fail, and with his influence and connections, it was even possible to change governments.</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young’s organization was closer to fists than to the law, but neither the prosecution nor the media ever struck him. Instead, politicians and businessmen alike sought his support and assistance to rise to the highest positions.</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek, aiming for more than just the party leadership, was no exception.</p>
<p>“President Kwon is no different from Yoon-gun. He likes beauties, and his relationships don’t last long.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek’s gaze fell on Kwon Jae-heon and his partner inside the venue. The woman gracefully smiling by his side, sticking closely to him, was the actress Ji Seo-hyun, who was currently at the height of her popularity.</p>
<p>“I believe he’ll do well.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek was not only persistent but also clever. He knew he had to turn this crisis into an opportunity by any means necessary. And for that, he needed Goyo. He needed someone who could persuade Kwon Moo-young, someone who could make Kwon Jae-heon join his side.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Lee.”</p>
<p>He didn’t hesitate to use any means necessary to catch Kwon Jae-heon’s attention, but Goyo couldn’t forget the gaze of Kwon Jae-heon as he looked at her.</p>
<p>Even if they had left a good impression on their first meeting, it would be difficult to change the worst first impression. It was a challenging game, even without the unfortunate encounter at Han Young Resort a month ago. Just the thought of that incident brought a headache to Goyo.</p>
<p>“You’re just my… dog!”</p>
<p>The man who overheard Lee Yoon-gun’s derogatory remark chuckled behind her.</p>
<p>To him, her first impression was as Yoon-gun’s dog. How could she erase the image of a dog ingrained in Kwon Jae-heon’s mind and surpass the shining appearance of the actress? Even now, there were people around him waiting for their turn to talk, perhaps even to her.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, she sighed.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have any confidence?”</p>
<p>There was a tinge of displeasure in Representative Lee Yi-taek’s voice. He detested being contradicted. But he couldn’t just speak of pleasant things. Not if he wanted to avoid severe repercussions in case of failure.</p>
<p>“That day, Yoon-gun… he called me a dog in front of President Kwon.”</p>
<p>The most humiliating person that day wasn’t Yoon-gun; it was her. Despite being covered in the filth Yoon-gun spewed, she couldn’t utter a single word of objection and had to play the part of a dog.</p>
