            <p><strong>Chapter 56.2</strong></p>
<p>“My side?”</p>
<p>Goyo scrutinized the suspicious man.</p>
<p>He had a studious look with silver-rimmed glasses. He appeared to be an ordinary man in his early to mid-thirties. Given his neat suit, he seemed to be a participant in the year-end party.</p>
<p>“I attended the charity event held at Tae-han Hotel as well. Unfortunately, we didn’t get to talk, though.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I wanted to meet without evading Congressman Lee’s gaze, but I didn’t expect you to run into Kwon Jae-heon and disappear.”</p>
<p>‘Is he a stalker?’</p>
<p>Goyo sighed at the situation where an unknown man approached her as soon as she was alone and started to get too familiar. There were many men who showed interest in her, but they never made a move openly, wary of Lee Yi-taek’s watchful eyes.</p>
<p>She thought everyone would know she was there as Kwon Jae-heon’s partner, so she felt somewhat safe, but it seemed she had underestimated the persistent desires of men.</p>
<p>“I was looking for a chance for us to talk quietly. I have something important to tell you.”</p>
<p>What could he possibly want to discuss with her alone?</p>
<p>While she didn’t sense any malice, there were more than a few things that raised her suspicions. He spoke as if he knew her well, but Goyo had no idea who he was.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it more important for you to reveal who you are first?”</p>
<p>“…It’s not the right time yet.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I’m not really interested in hearing what you have to say,” She didn’t want to engage in conversation with a suspicious man who wouldn’t even reveal his identity. She would rather endure the suffocating atmosphere in the banquet hall. To signal that she no longer wanted to talk to him, Goyo turned her gaze back to the window.</p>
<p>“Ms. Goyo, if you don’t listen to me, you’ll regret it. Ah, I’ve already been found out.”</p>
<p>The man sighed, lowered his head, and whispered.</p>
<p>“We don’t have much time. Just listen.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>As the man’s voice flowed into her ear, Goyo quickly turned her head. Their eyes met, and the man interrupted her, hurriedly spilling out his words.</p>
<p>“I’m investigating the kidnapping case from 14 years ago.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me… what?”</p>
<p>While the public had nearly forgotten the incident, Goyo could never forget it. Her biological father lost his life, and the Lee Yi-taek family constantly reminded her of that event, threatening her and forcing her to submit.</p>
<p>Surprised by the man’s sudden mention of her trauma, Goyo was at a loss for words. She stared at him, but her mind went blank, and she couldn’t think.</p>
<p>“Ms. Goyo, you’re being deceived. They’ve blocked your eyes and ears to cover up the events of that day.”</p>
<p>“What… what do you mean? Who exactly has deceived me?”</p>
<p>Goyo could hardly breathe at the shocking revelation she had never heard before.</p>
<p>“This is my personal direct line. If you want to know the truth about that day, contact me.”</p>
<p>He slipped a rolled-up piece of paper into the clutch bag she had placed on the table. The man added urgently, “Don’t trust Yi-taek, Jae-heon, or anyone,” before finally lifting his head.</p>
<p>What am I being deceived about? Someone has covered up the events of that day?</p>
<p>Lee Chul-woo kidnapped Lee Yoon-gun. That was a simple explanation of what happened that day. What could possibly be deceptive about that?</p>
<p>By the way, how much does this man know? Does he even know that I’m the daughter of Lee Chul-woo?</p>
<p>Goyo’s mouth moved as she had too many questions. The man shook his head firmly, signaling her not to say anything.</p>
<p>“Hey, who are you?”</p>
<p>A sharp voice came from behind the man. As he straightened up, Jae-heon came into Goyo’s view.</p>
<p>“I’m asking you, who are you?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s fierce gaze was fixed on the man.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit surprising to be asked so abruptly,” The man said in defense.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, but I’m the one who’s more surprised to see some guy getting too familiar with my girl.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon twisted his lips into a smirk and set down the wine and glasses he had brought to the table.</p>
<p>“Shall I ask again? Who are you? Oh, is it because I haven’t introduced myself? I’m Kwon Jae-heon, the owner of this building and the Executive Director of KJ Finance. Now, tell me, okay?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon crossed his arms and tilted his head, looking down at the man. Despite the intimidation from Jae-heon, the man, who was a head shorter, stood his ground without showing any signs of backing down.</p>
<p>“You’re as rude as I’ve heard,” The man adjusted his silver-rimmed glasses slightly and smiled.</p>
