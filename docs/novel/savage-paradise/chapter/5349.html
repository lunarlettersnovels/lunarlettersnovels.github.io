            <p><strong>Chapter 7.2</strong></p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek’s intentions were obvious.</p>
<p>It meant that Park Jung-hoon was so important to him that he needed to maintain the connection, even in this way. Although he appeared light-hearted on the surface, Park Jung-hoon was the heir to a media conglomerate in South Korea. He was like a beast hiding its claws, ready to strike at any moment.</p>
<p>“Honestly, you’re the first woman who has made me this flustered.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Was my comment stale?”</p>
<p>Goyo had no time to respond to Park Jung-hoon’s words.</p>
<p>As soon as the auction ended, Kwon Jae-heon stood up without hesitation, as if the necklace was the only item he wanted. Ji Seo-hyun immediately followed him.</p>
<p>Goyo also had no reason to stay. Right now, gaining Kwon Jae-heon’s favor was more important than building a relationship with Park Jung-hoon.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment.”</p>
<p>As Goyo rose from her seat, Park Jung-hoon grabbed her wrist. She looked down silently at her wrist, prompting him to release it in a flustered panic.</p>
<p>“S-sorry. You stood up so suddenly.”</p>
<p>“Do you have something else you need from me?”</p>
<p>She was in a hurry. Kwon Jae-heon was already heading towards the exit.</p>
<p>“How about this? It’s the next item up for auction.”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon hastily opened a pamphlet and thrust it towards Goyo.</p>
<p>“This is more expensive than the necklace earlier.”</p>
<p>His voice grew louder in his urgency, drawing the attention of those waiting for the next auction to start.</p>
<p>“I’m not usually like this. I just feel like I’d regret it if I let you go…”</p>
<p>Thanks to his handsome looks and his status as the heir to a media company, Park Jung-hoon was always surrounded by women. He never had to work hard to attract or court women.</p>
<p>Yet here he was, face flushed, practically begging one woman. Many people in the auction house knew who he was. They whispered among themselves, surprised by his behavior.</p>
<p>“Can I have your contact information?”</p>
<p>“…Later.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult for her to give him her contact information. The issue was that she didn’t have the time right now. As Goyo’s gaze shifted elsewhere, Park Jung-hoon grew more anxious.</p>
<p>“Would you like to have dinner with me? Or maybe a drink… No, at least your name. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon, the heir of Seongjo Daily, blushing in front of a woman was a rare sight. He was unusually excited, like a novice on his first date.</p>
<p>When Goyo remained silent, anxiety flashed across his face.</p>
<p>“I fell in love at first sight!”</p>
<p>The sudden confession from Park Jung-hoon caused a stir among the crowd. Some people looked shocked.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Goyo’s face was filled with awkwardness. The confession of love, at first sight, could easily be dismissed as a cliché pick-up line, but the problem was the people around them, whispering and staring at her.</p>
<p>‘This will spread like wildfire.’</p>
<p>Goyo was already branded with malicious labels like Lee Yi-taek’s puppet or Lee Yun-geon’s pet. She wondered what rumors would start now. That she was a gold digger who didn’t discriminate between relatives or divorcees as long as they had money? Or perhaps they would gossip about how one should never keep a black-haired beast that doesn’t know its roots?</p>
<p>As all eyes turned to her, Goyo felt too flustered to lift her head. She wanted to escape the situation quickly, but she couldn’t move.</p>
<p>Standing in the aisle, she was trying to exit through was Kwon Jae-heon, staring intently at her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon had been on his way to the exit when he passed by her row and stopped, noticing the commotion caused by Park Jung-hoon.</p>
<p>“Every time I see you, it’s entertaining.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s heart sank at the sound of his cold voice that seemed to pierce her eardrums.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon let out a small, mocking laugh.</p>
<p>“And I’ve seen quite a different side of Executive Director Park.”</p>
<p>His words sounded light-hearted, but his eyes were filled with mockery.</p>
<p>“Kwon Jae-heon, what are you up to?”</p>
<p>Ignoring Park Jung-hoon, Kwon Jae-heon flashed a sly smile at Goyo. “I haven’t decided yet. Hmm, what do you want to do with me?”His gaze, subtly raising one eyebrow, bore the same intensity as it did that day.</p>
<p>“This young lady, I mean, this lady is with me… Oh, darn it! Anyway, it’s me first. Can’t you see I’m in the middle of making dinner plans? Kwon Jae-heon, you go your own way. Your date is waiting for you.”</p>
<p>As Jae-heon showed interest in Goyo, Park Jung-hoon raised his voice with irritation. He was politely trying to court a woman he liked, and now this guy, who had found a woman he liked, was getting in his way even though he already had a partner.</p>
