            <p><strong>Chapter 49.2</strong></p>
<p>The emoticon seemed out of character for him, but Goyo found herself drawn to it.</p>
<p>At first, she had thought he was a frightening person. His family background and the work he did were anything but ordinary, so she was suspicious of what might be hidden behind his kind words and actions.</p>
<p>‘I keep wanting to trust him.’</p>
<p>The respect and consideration she had never received before made her heart race. Trusting people was one of the most foolish things to do, yet for some reason, she wanted to trust Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>‘How much more do I have to endure to wake up?’</p>
<p>Goyo shook her head as she thought of Lee Yi-taek.</p>
<p>On the surface, Lee Yi-taek was an exemplary politician who appeared to be honest and dedicated to justice. His social media was filled with images of him volunteering at nursing homes and diligently supporting low-income children. He was also active in protecting stray dogs, going beyond mere humanitarianism.</p>
<p>He was a conscientious politician who shed tears for the less fortunate and felt pain at the sight of injustice.</p>
<p>Who would imagine that such a person would beat his biological child with a golf club for not meeting his expectations and use his adopted daughter as a tool for gaining power?</p>
<p>To Goyo, Kwon Jae-heon seemed more human compared to the facade of Lee Yi-taek.</p>
<p>At first, she was taken aback by his straightforward words, but she soon realized that he held no grudges. In contrast, with Lee Yi-taek, his words and actions were always inconsistent, leaving her tense even after following his orders, unsure of what would happen next.</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>No matter what anyone said, Goyo felt good about the present moment. It was the first time in over a decade that she felt such peace.</p>
<p>The five days she spent with him felt like a restful retreat. He also mentioned that the days they spent together were a break he hadn’t had in a year.</p>
<p>Although his claim of being on vacation seemed dubious, as his phone rang continuously during their time together, he appeared to be committed to his word, spending quality time without stepping outside.</p>
<p>They ate takeout for every meal and had s*x like crazy. She was completely exhausted from keeping up with Jae-heon’s beast-like stamina.</p>
<p>Fortunately, today she was allowed to go out under the pretext of a gathering in the evening. As she stepped outside for the first time in a while, a sudden thought crossed her mind.</p>
<p>‘Have I been imprisoned without realizing it?’</p>
<p>She had been taken to Jae-heon’s house almost as if she had been kidnapped, unprepared and without any clothes. Honestly, she never imagined she would stay at his house for this long.</p>
<p>The only good thing was that since all they did at his house was have s*x, she often found herself wearing less rather than more.</p>
<p>‘How can I think of this as a good thing?’</p>
<p>Even though it felt like she was being held captive, the mental comfort made her think that living like this wouldn’t be so bad. Just not being beaten was truly a blessing for her.</p>
<p>Is this what they call Stockholm syndrome?</p>
<p>She had no place to go after leaving his house.</p>
<p>Goyo had never once thought of Lee Yi-taek’s house as her home. It was merely a place where she had taken refuge because she had nowhere else to go. Even though she had lived there for 14 years, the few days spent with Kwon Jae-heon were far happier.</p>
<p>Jae-heon always asked for her opinion on whatever he did. Although some things were overwhelming, he cared about her well-being.</p>
<p>He gave her expensive gifts without expecting anything in return. Of course, it wasn’t entirely without cost, but the demands were trivial compared to what Lee Yi-taek asked for.</p>
<p>He requested oral s<em>x and anal s</em>x. She agreed to the former and declined the latter.</p>
<p>“…Excessive.”</p>
<p>She was receiving gifts that were far too extravagant compared to what she was giving.</p>
<p>The items he purchased today were shockingly expensive. The jewelry, as well as bags and shoes, were so costly that wearing them felt burdensome.</p>
<p>Not knowing how long she would stay at Jae-heon’s house, she was contemplating whether she should go to Lee Yi-taek’s house to gather her belongings.</p>
<p>“Phew…”</p>
<p>She couldn’t move hastily, not knowing what state Lee Yi-taek was in.</p>
<p>‘Surely the Congressman knows about this?’</p>
<p>Her phone was broken, making it impossible to contact Lee Yi-taek. Not knowing the circumstances was unsettling. Given Jae-heon’s personality, it didn’t seem likely that he had a pleasant conversation with the Congressman. Even when she asked Jae-heon, he only said he would handle it, which was frustrating.</p>
<p>It was because the Congressman had told her to get along with Kwon Jae-heon that things had turned out this way; she hoped he wouldn’t blame her entirely.</p>
<p>She didn’t know much about Jae-heon’s romantic escapades, but Lee Yi-taek had summed him up in one sentence.</p>
<p>“Kwon Jae-heon is no different from Yoon-gun. He likes beautiful women and has a short dating cycle.”</p>
<p>If his words were true, then the relationship between Jae-heon and her was likely on borrowed time.</p>
<p>The fire they had ignited could extinguish at any moment. It was just that she was anxious because she didn’t know when that would be.</p>
