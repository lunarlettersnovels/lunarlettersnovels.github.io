<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>People in the world may label him a heartless killer, but to me, he is a savior.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The place where he is, that is my paradise.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
<p><em>– Last weekend, a woman was kidnapped in the heart of Gangnam. The Seoul Gangnam Police urgently arrested the suspect who kidnapped the female college student, Ms. A. The suspect’s identity quickly spread through social media… a law school student, whose father is a three-term National Assembly member and former prosecutor…</em></p>
<p>It took no time for the black clouds that rose from one part of the city to cover the entire sky.</p>
<p>A flash of lightning illuminated the sky, darkened by thick clouds. Soon after, a loud thunderclap followed, and heavy raindrops began to pound on car roofs.</p>
<p>Even though it was daytime, it was so dark that without headlights on, it was hard to see ahead. Cars hurriedly turned on their hazard lights and slowed down.</p>
<p><em>– In other news, Representative Lee Eui-taek of the Korean Party is under suspicion for an overzealous investigation he led 15 years ago when he was a deputy chief prosecutor. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office Anti-Corruption Department is investigating…</em></p>
<p>Inside a car parked on the roadside with its hazard lights on.</p>
<p>Without the wipers on, rainwater continuously streamed down the windshield, and over the dry voice from the radio, the sound of sweaty, intimate bodies filled the car.</p>
<p>“Aah.”</p>
<p>Before Lee Goyo could gather her thoughts, he pulled out and thrust back in. The blunt head of his p*nis pressing into her tight opening sent tingles throughout her body. Her toes curled involuntarily, and her head kept falling back against the seat.</p>
<p>Even though the luxury sedan was spacious, the tall man on top of her made the space feel cramped. Unlike her, who couldn’t move, he maneuvered his body skillfully. His actions were confident, as if he was accustomed to doing such things in a car.</p>
<p>“Ah, haah…”</p>
<p>The solid mass pressing against her cervix retreated, grazing her walls before thrusting back in forcefully. The rough p*netration that seemed to pierce her insides continued relentlessly.</p>
<p>The headlights of an approaching car seeped through the moisture-laden windows, diffusing into the car. Her tightly shut eyes kept seeing white flashes.</p>
<p>“Pl-please, slow down. Ugh.”</p>
<p>Despite her pleading, his thrusts did not weaken. In fact, her whimpering seemed to excite him even more, making his movements more vigorous.</p>
<p>She suddenly worried about the wound on his abdomen.</p>
<p>“Haa, ugh. The wound… if it opens, wh-what… ah, ah!”</p>
<p>“Are you worrying about me now? Lee Goyo worrying about Kwon Jae-heon?”</p>
<p>“You were… hurt badly… ugh, ugh.”</p>
<p>No matter how great his power was, his body was just like any other human’s. He couldn’t block bullets or knives, yet he had thrown himself to protect her like a hero in a movie.</p>
<p>“This won’t kill me.”</p>
<p>He rotated his hips slowly, pressing the tip of his protruding shaft against different spots inside her. Her inner walls twitched as if in spasms, releasing clear fluid that soaked the veiny shaft.</p>
<p>“Haa, ugh, uhh.”</p>
<p>As he continuously prodded her tender insides, a blaze ignited within her belly. Her mind grew dizzy and her vision turned white. The fire spread through her veins, engulfing her entire body. It felt as though she might burn up completely and turn to ash.</p>
<p>“Why is it still so tight after all this pounding, huh?”</p>
<p>“Ugh. Ah, aah.”</p>
<p>Thrust after thrust, he moved his hips roughly, causing her fluids to splash. She could feel every ridge and bump of his blunt head and veiny shaft vividly, sending shivers down her spine.</p>
<p>The headlights of passing cars intermittently illuminated his face like stage lights. Seeing the ecstasy on his face as he ravaged her made her own pleasure soar. She twisted her body and clenched tightly around him.</p>
<p>“Ugh. …It’s too deep. Ah, ah.”</p>
