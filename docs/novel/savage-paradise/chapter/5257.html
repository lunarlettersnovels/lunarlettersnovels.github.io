            <p><strong>Chapter 55.1</strong></p>
<p><em>20 minutes later.</em></p>
<p>“Our Director Kwon takes after me—so dignified. He’s just like me in my younger days.”</p>
<p>“Of course, Elder, he takes after you…”</p>
<p>“Hey now, not elder, Chairman! ‘Elder’ makes me sound like an old man.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Chairman.”</p>
<p>Goyo was watching Kwon Moo-young walk around the banquet hall with Ji Seohyun, using well-wishing remarks as an excuse to brag about his son. Whether it was “Chairman” or “Elder,” it didn’t make much difference, but Kwon Moo-young clearly preferred to be called “Chairman.”</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young was in the process of legitimizing his business through Jae-heon.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why. The word “Elder” made him sound old, yes—but more than that, the nuance suggested a gang leader or a head of a syndicate.</p>
<p>“When I was young, it’s not that I was short—it’s that Jae-heon’s tall. He’s 190 cm, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Director Kwon is particularly tall.”</p>
<p>“Even his brains take after me. He’s fantastic. Korea University, Korea U!”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon followed him around with a sulky expression. He was trailing after his father to get him out quickly before he caused any trouble, but from the outside, it looked like a proud dad dragging around his accomplished son, showing him off.</p>
<p>“He’s so impressive, and yet he’s still unmarried. I wonder if I’ll get to see a grandchild next year?”</p>
<p>“If Director Kwon sets his mind to it, he could get married right away. He’s the top bachelor, after all.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. Who are you again?”</p>
<p>“I’m Oh, from Oh Foods…”</p>
<p>“Oh right, you’re the one who sells tofu and bean sprouts, right?”</p>
<p>To Kwon Moo-young, even Oh Foods—one of the top three food companies in Korea—might as well have been a neighborhood corner store. President Oh seemed flustered for a moment and muttered, “T-tofu, b-bean sprouts… yes, that’s right. We do sell those.”</p>
<p>His darting pupils were noticeable even to Goyo.</p>
<p>“President Oh, don’t you have a daughter of marrying age?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my eldest is in her final year at university. She’s majoring in cello.”</p>
<p>“Oh, very nice. Jae-heon, did you hear that? President Oh’s eldest daughter is of marrying age. Let’s get you a grandchild by next year.”</p>
<p>Standing behind him, Secretary Ahn kept glancing at his watch in distress, but Kwon Moo-young ignored him and stayed laser-focused on bragging about his son and talking about matchmaking. Unable to watch any longer, Jae-heon stepped in.</p>
<p>“Father, that’s enough.”</p>
<p>“What? What’s wrong with bragging about my son?”</p>
<p>“There’s not a single person here who doesn’t already know everything about me. Did you forget this is my company’s year-end party?”</p>
<p>The attendees here were executives and employees of KJ Finance, along with representatives from companies in which KJ Finance was the major shareholder. They were all people well-acquainted with Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“Exactly. So pick someone from your side. Your bride.”</p>
<p>Was he senile already, talking about an arranged marriage?</p>
<p>“I’ll handle my marriage myself, so please don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>“When? When on earth are you going to get married? At my age, I should be bragging about my grandkids. Chairman Yang says his grandson is graduating middle school, and Mayor Joo just gave me his granddaughter’s wedding invitation a few days ago. Even if you started now, by the time your kid gets into college—”</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize you were so eager to have grandkids.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon pressed his fingers to his temples, holding back his irritation.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to get married to have children.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t get married, and yet here you are.”</p>
<p>To Kwon Moo-young, a child was like Achilles’ heel. With so many enemies, he saw children as potential hostages and thus major liabilities.</p>
<p>And instead of allowing a weakness to exist, Kwon Moo-young decided he would rather erase it with his own hands.</p>
<p>“I survived thanks to my mother.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon had only been born because his mother escaped while pregnant. She lived in constant fear that Kwon Moo-young would take Jae-heon from her—and in constant dread that Kwon Moo-young’s enemies would learn of her son’s existence.</p>
<p>The anxiety consumed her. She suffered from nervous breakdowns and depression, and eventually took her own life. Jae-heon was ten at the time.</p>
<p>He saw his father for the first time at her funeral.</p>
<p>“He looks just like me.”</p>
<p>He could never forget those cold eyes staring down at him.</p>
<p>In truth, Kwon Moo-young had always known about Jae-heon’s existence. He had simply left him alone—thinking he might one day need an heir. If Jae-heon had turned out to be a liability, he would’ve discarded him without hesitation.</p>
<p>His mother had thought she’d escaped from Kwon Moo-young’s grip completely—but it was all an illusion. She had remained a pawn in his game until the moment she died.</p>
<p>“Just one word would’ve been enough.”</p>
<p>If Kwon Moo-young had just told her not to worry about him and to raise the child well—she wouldn’t have lived in such terror, and wouldn’t have died like that.</p>
<p>Even so, Jae-heon didn’t plan to blame his father. Letting her go despite her defiance had been an uncharacteristic act of mercy on his part.</p>
<p>And yet this man was now talking about grandchildren?</p>
