            <p><strong>Chapter 6.1</strong></p>
<p>“What’s the problem with that?”</p>
<p>“Ji Seo-hyun is… very beautiful.”</p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun was dazzlingly beautiful, befitting her title as a beautiful actress. She smiled sweetly at Kwon Jae-heon, who had his arms crossed, and he occasionally smiled back at her.</p>
<p>Even in that brief moment, his smile was breathtaking enough to stop onlookers in their tracks, but Goyo knew the true nature hidden behind that expression.</p>
<p>He was the type of man who would ruthlessly punish anyone who caused him harm. Because he was Lee Yi-taek’s son, it ended at that level; otherwise, Lee Yoon-gun might already be on the list of missing persons.</p>
<p>“She’s incomparable to a dog.”</p>
<p>“You’re like my daughter. You can’t be compared to some entertainer.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek’s gaze swept Goyo from head to toe.</p>
<p>Expertly styled hair and makeup. A dress by a famous designer and expensive accessories. It was a flawless appearance that even the most meticulous wives of chaebols couldn’t find fault with.</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek relaxed the wrinkles on his forehead and put on a gentle smile. Like a seasoned politician, he quickly adopted the expression of a caring father.</p>
<p>“If it comes to that, you could always become Kwon Jae-heon’s dog.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek’s eyes glinted slyly.</p>
<p>Not only did they want her to be Lee Yoon-gun’s dog, but now they wanted her to be Kwon Jae-heon’s dog as well. The feeling of an invisible leash tightening around her neck made Goyo feel suffocated.</p>
<p>“It’s really troublesome that Yoon-gun coveted the elder’s belongings. I should compensate appropriately, but I’m still pondering what would be best.”</p>
<p>These weren’t words to be taken lightly. It was a threat that if she didn’t catch Kwon Jae-heon’s eye, they would make her Kwon Moo-young’s concubine.</p>
<p>Time passed, and Lee Yi-taek stepped onto the podium as the representative to give a congratulatory speech.</p>
<p>With a benevolent expression, he explained the history and purpose of the charity event. When he mentioned that part of the auction proceeds would be used to help underprivileged children and single-parent families, he even looked solemn.</p>
<p>“…He doesn’t care at all.”</p>
<p>He was someone who only cared about the pretext of helping the needy, not the details.</p>
<p>The charity event featured both an auction and a party. The pamphlet provided details on the items up for auction. Those interested could move to the auction venue, while others could stay and enjoy the party.</p>
<p>Older attendees generally stayed to enjoy the party. They preferred to foster relationships comfortably rather than stress over unnecessary competition.</p>
<p>On the other hand, younger people typically attended the auction. They might be interested in the artworks or jewelry up for auction, or they simply need a place to escape the excessive attention and nagging of the elders.</p>
<p>Goyo quietly exited the event hall and stood in front of the elevator. She needed to go down to the basement. There was a man there she needed to get close to.</p>
<p>Goyo had to remind herself of her situation, regardless of her will.</p>
<p>Reflected in the glossy elevator doors was a woman adorned by self-proclaimed beauty experts.</p>
<p>‘Like a courtesan.’</p>
<p>There couldn’t be a more fitting word for someone about to throw herself at a man to seduce him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The auction was tedious.</p>
<p>The expensive paintings looked like a child’s scribbles, and the vintage wine seemed like an extravagant luxury for drunks. She had no appreciation for or interest in the artwork, and most importantly, her purpose for being here was Kwon Jae-heon, so there was no way the auction could be enjoyable.</p>
<p>Goyo leaned her elbow on the armrest of her chair and rested her chin on the back of her hand.</p>
<p>“They look good together.”</p>
<p>At the end of her gaze were Kwon Jae-heon and Ji Seo-hyun, who had accompanied him.</p>
<p>The auction hall was already packed with people eager to flaunt their wealth. She barely managed to find a seat relatively close to Kwon Jae-heon, giving her a clear view of Ji Seo-hyun’s flushed profile and the back of Kwon Jae-heon’s head.</p>
<p>‘He hasn’t looked back even once.’</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon kept his eyes forward, possibly interested in winning some item. To catch his attention, she’d probably have to shout out an absurdly high bid. Only then might he turn around out of curiosity.</p>
<p>‘And if he does turn around?’</p>
<p>What would change if their eyes met?</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek had insisted she does whatever it took to catch Kwon Jae-heon’s eye, but Goyo wasn’t confident. She had little to no experience with romance. The only man around her had been the despicable Lee Yoon-gun—how was she supposed to seduce anyone?</p>
