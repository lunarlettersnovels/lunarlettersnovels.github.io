            <p><strong>Chapter 17.1</strong></p>
<p>“Huh, take it out, take it out… Ugh, uh!”</p>
<p>Stopping the short, teasing kiss on her lips, Jae-heon deeply inserted his tongue between her lips. Entwining and sucking on her tongue while biting it, he simultaneously thrust himself in. He eventually rammed it into the root. The perfectly interlocked junction quivered without an inch of error.</p>
<p>“Ah, ahh, you said it would be good….”</p>
<p>“It can’t be good from the start.”</p>
<p>Looking down at Goyo, who was clutching the sheets and writhing, Jae-heon paused to catch his breath. Then, he started to grind deeply.</p>
<p>“Ah, no, ah, such, irresponsible… haa, ah.”</p>
<p>“It will feel good from now on.”</p>
<p>As Jae-heon twisted his hips, pressing down firmly on the tender flesh where they met, sticky fluids started to flow from her. Goyo unknowingly tensed her vag*nal muscles. The narrow hole clamped, chewed, and squirmed around him.</p>
<p>As she tightened as if to bite him, Jae-heon furrowed his brows and let out a long breath.</p>
<p>“Oppa, you’re doing an amazing job.”</p>
<p>So it will feel good. Probably.</p>
<p>Looking back now, he realized that he had never had s*x, considering his partner. To him, it had always been a sport to relieve stress, and had never put in this much effort to coax and soothe his partner.</p>
<p>“Don’t say things like that… ahh.”</p>
<p>“It will feel good soon. Just hold on a bit.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon slowly pulled back his hips, withdrawing his meat. He pulled back until the concave part of the glans was caught at the entrance, then slowly pushed it back in. He repeatedly thrust it in deeply, to the point where his swollen testicles were pressed, then withdrew again.</p>
<p>The sound of their wet friction followed Jae-heon’s rhythmic thrusting. All of Goyo’s nerves were focused on her lower body. The tremors starting from her small hole spread throughout her body, and the pleasure building in her stomach grew until it reached the top of her head.</p>
<p>“Stop crying, honey.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon flicked away the tears clinging to her long eyelashes with his fingers. The tears that had gathered at the corners of her eyes then fell and ran down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Jae-heon was dying of curiosity. Pain and pleasure were just a fine line apart, and he wondered what kind of face this woman would make when crying out in pleasure.</p>
<p>Jae-heon slowly pulled himself out, leaving just the tip of the glans inside, and gave Goyo a lazy smile.</p>
<p>“I’m f*cking you while showing incredible patience.”</p>
<p>Thrust, thrust, thrust. His slow thrusts gradually began to pick up speed.</p>
<p>“N-no, crying, huh, ah, no… ah, it’s happening on its own, ah.”</p>
<p>Goyo looked at Jae-heon with tearful eyes.</p>
<p>That look was insanely beautiful. It made him want to make her cry even more.</p>
<p>“Ha, this makes me want to make you cry more.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon realized today that he had a sadistic streak. He had seen women whimpering during s*x, but a woman crying like this…</p>
<p>Lee Goyo had caught his attention from the first time he saw her at the Cheondo Han Young Resort.</p>
<p>Women usually show fear or terror when faced with a violent situation. It’s horrifying even to see a stranger getting hit, let alone when the victim is someone akin to her family. Yet she had remained expressionless like she was watching a stray dog at someone else’s house.</p>
<p>Even when their eyes met, she had maintained an unreadable expression.</p>
<p>But now, she had finally broken down.</p>
<p>As he sucked hers and thrust his manhood in, cracks appeared in the solid wall that had remained unshaken. Though the emotions she felt were closer to pain than pleasure, with her face flushed and her body writhing in spasms, the pleasure Jae-heon derived from her appearance was indescribable.</p>
<p>“Where did this come from?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon pulled his hips back and thrust in one swift motion. He plunged deeply into her soaking wet folds and withdrew. Every time he pounded to the hilt, her delicate body trembled.</p>
<p>“Haah, ah, ahh….”</p>
<p>Her soft moans and trembling eyelids melted his resolve more tenderly than anything else. Her inner walls tightened fiercely around his invading flesh. The sticky friction and her moans intoxicated Jae-heon with desire, making it unbearable to resist.</p>
<p>“F*ck….”</p>
<p>Stimulated by Goyo’s hoarse voice, curses escaped Jae-heon’s lips.</p>
<p>Damn it… I almost came right there.</p>
<p>“Stop tightening. I almost came.”</p>
<p>With eyes filled with pleasure, Jae-heon exhaled roughly. Despite complaining aloud, he couldn’t stop the thrusting motion—pulling back and then forcefully thrusting in. Deep, rough thrusts rocked through her swollen s*x.</p>
<p>“Aah… P-president. Uh, ugh.”</p>
<p>“Honey, you should use the proper title. Why would I be your representative?”</p>
<p>Thud, thwack! Jae-heon firmly gripped Goyo’s side and forcefully thrust his hips. As his movements intensified, his penetration deepened.</p>
<p>“Jae-heon… Ah, yes, ah! Uh.”</p>
<p>“Don’t resist. Call me again properly, huh?”</p>
<p>“… Ugh, uh, huh.”</p>
<p>“Is it hard to call me ‘Oppa’?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon stubbornly persisted when the title I wanted didn’t come out, seeming unwilling to let it pass.</p>
<p>“Ah, too, too much, huh, mm.”</p>
<p>As the glans, having scraped the folds of her vag<em>na, caught at the entrance, he gently rotated his hips. Then, with a strong thrust, he pressed deeply inside her, pressing firmly against the walls of her vag</em>na.</p>
<p>Goyo keenly felt the veins that had risen above the pillar inside her belly. Excitement surged as he scratched and stirred her inner walls, naturally tightening underneath.</p>
<p>“Oppa….”</p>
<p>It was a small sound that could only be heard if you listened closely. Yet, as if understanding it supernaturally, Jae-heon’s grip on Goyo’s side tightened with force.</p>
