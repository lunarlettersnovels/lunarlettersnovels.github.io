            <p><strong>Chapter 39.2</strong></p>
<p>The bitterness in Goyo’s voice echoed as she retorted, but her response only seemed to trigger Jae-heon’s callousness.</p>
<p><strong>“Isn’t being an object better than being a dog?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“That… wasn’t my choice.”</strong></p>
<p>She bit her lower lip, the weight of his words sinking deep. Who would ever choose to be treated like an animal? The cruel choice to submit, to lower herself to survive, wasn’t something anyone would willingly accept. Yet, for the sake of staying alive, she had done just that.</p>
<p><strong>“I treat my possessions with care, unlike others. So, I’ll take what’s mine.”</strong></p>
<p>Goyo recoiled, feeling the sting of those words. She wasn’t a possession. She wasn’t a toy, a pet, or anything to be claimed and discarded at will. The desire for respect, for basic human dignity, wasn’t too much to ask for, was it? But why, why did everyone treat her like this—like something expendable, insignificant?</p>
<p><strong>“If you impulsively buy something just because you like it, you’ll regret it later.”</strong></p>
<p>At the charity event, Goyo had been dolled up to perfection, as per Lee Yi-taek’s instructions. From head to toe, everything was designed to grab attention: her hair, makeup, dress, accessories—each chosen with care to make her seem like the perfect, pristine object. She looked the part of a luxury item, a picture-perfect appearance meant to hide the rotting truth inside.</p>
<p><strong>“You said you didn’t want to be treated like an object.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“It was overpriced..”</strong></p>
<p>Her appearance had done its job, though. She had captured Jae-heon’s attention just as Lee Yi-taek had intended, tailoring her look to match his specific preferences. And in the process, she also caught the eye of Park Jeong-hoon, who had been interested in her as an added bonus.</p>
<p><strong>“I’m just warning you in case you want to return or exchange me later due to a sudden change of heart.”</strong></p>
<p>Her words were a bitter mix of sarcasm and truth. Goyo was well aware of her situation, and the idea of being discarded or replaced at a whim made her sick to her stomach. Yet, it was a reality she couldn’t escape from.</p>
<p>At Jae-heon’s words, Goyo recalled her situation.</p>
<p>Wasn’t she like an item up for auction to him? Whoever offered the highest price would own it. Just like the necklace hanging around her neck.</p>
<p>The word “item” made her feel angry, and she retorted, but Jae-heon’s response was more of a reaction as if to say, “What’s the big deal?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it better than a dog?”</p>
<p>“That… wasn’t my choice.”</p>
<p>Goyo bit her lower lip.</p>
<p>Who would want to be treated like a dog? She only lowered herself to survive.</p>
<p>“I treat my things with care, unlike others. So, it’s mine now.”</p>
<p>“CEO.”</p>
<p>Goyo didn’t want to be an object, a dog, or a product. Was it too much to want to be respected as an equal human being? Why did everyone think so little of her?</p>
<p>“If you impulsively buy something because you like it, you’ll regret it later.”</p>
<p>When Goyo appeared at the charity event, she was the most beautiful there. Under Lee Yi-taek’s orders, an expert had dressed her from head to toe from the early morning. Hairstyling, makeup, dress, and accessories.</p>
<p>No matter how ruined and decayed her insides were, she was carefully polished and packaged to appear like a luxury item on the outside.</p>
<p>“You said you didn’t like being treated as an item.”</p>
<p>“It was over-packaging.”</p>
<p>Thanks to this, she managed to capture Jae-heon’s attention. It was all because Lee Yi-taek had tailored her appearance to Jae-heon’s tastes. The attention from Seongjo Ilbo’s Park Jeong-hoon was an accidental bonus.</p>
<p>“I’m just telling you in advance, in case you decide to exchange or return me because of a sudden change of heart.”</p>
<p>It might be a defective product or it might not be what she originally expected. On the surface, it may have appeared luxurious and appetizing, but it could not meet her expectations or match her tastes.</p>
<p>Just like Ji Seo-hyun, who was abandoned because of a sudden change of heart, Goyo could very well end up the same way.</p>
<p>If that happens, Lee Yi-taek would just repackage her and sell her off. If something goes wrong in the process and it loses its value, it would be sold at a ridiculously low price.</p>
<p>“Baby, I’m curious now, so I’ll ask. Do you want me to return you?”</p>
<p>His voice resonated sweetly, but there was something about it that sent a chill down her spine.</p>
<p>“If you return it, who’s it going to?”</p>
<p>Park Jeong-hoon, who’s a fool for his fantasies?</p>
<p>The guy who relies on his dad’s connections, takes drugs, and sleeps around?</p>
<p>Or maybe some older man who can’t act his age and chases after women?</p>
<p>“Should I have put a shackle on you instead of a necklace? Makes me regret it.”</p>
<p>Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The gift, dressed from head to toe in his own style, was thrown in front of him. It was a gift from Santa Claus, something he had never received even once as a child.</p>
<p>He had lived quite diligently until now. So, he thought it wouldn’t be too bad to receive the kind of Santa gift everyone else had received. And so, he took it without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Honey, you keep abandoning me and thinking about going to someone else.”</p>
<p>Thanks to the Christmas gift he liked quite a bit, he had a pleasant time.</p>
<p>Even though he knew why Lee Yi-taek sent Lee Goyo to him, he willingly played along. Before the holiday ended, Lee Yoon-gun ruined the mood and his father threw ashes on it, but he still liked the gift, so he held back.</p>
<p>When he realized that this gift was a promotional item used to attract customers, he got so angry that he felt blood rush to his head. He wished it had been something no one wanted. But, of course, it was a premium limited edition item, so everyone wanted to get their hands on it.</p>
<p>“Just remember one thing. Don’t even dream of exchanging or returning it.”</p>
<p>Even if he insisted it was a shipping mistake, it couldn’t be undone now. He took it, used it well, and stamped his mark all over it, claiming it as his.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t like sharing his things.”</p>
<p>Since he was young, he had an obsession with his belongings. He didn’t think it had gotten any better; if anything, it was worse. Just looking at this mess was driving him crazy.</p>
<p>“He might as well dispose of it.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon tilted his upper body and kissed her neck.</p>
<p>The scent of cigarettes mixed with a refreshing perfume wafted from the edge of his clothes that brushed against her face. It was a scent that left no room for other thoughts, the kind that made only one man come to mind.</p>
<p>“Did you grab my hand without even being prepared for this? You really have no fear.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon let out a low laugh that was almost a chuckle.</p>
<p>“Just promise me one thing.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Promise me you’ll stop Lee Yoon-gun.” She said.</p>
<p>‘I would gladly accept even a poisoned apple.’</p>
<p>“You know I’d kill him for you. Don’t you believe me?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t that she was scared, but she just wanted to double-check. Jae-heon’s threat, telling her not to think of running away and that he wouldn’t abandon her, gave Goyo the trust she needed.</p>
<p>The certainty that she wouldn’t be returned or abandoned.</p>
<p>The certainty that she wouldn’t be discarded as useless.</p>
<p>The certainty that she could escape from the dreaded Lee Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>“I believe you. And, though it’s late… thank you for admitting me to the hospital.”</p>
<p>He had been worried when she collapsed, getting her admitted and even placing bodyguards in the hallway.</p>
<p>The Lee Yi-taek family had lived together for over ten years, but they were just lucky if they didn’t hurt her. The thought of treatment had never even crossed their minds.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling better?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“If it hurts, don’t force yourself.”</p>
<p>He placed his hand on her forehead. His hand, carrying the sharp scent of cigarettes, was surprisingly gentle.</p>
<p>“I’m really fine.”</p>
<p>Goyo found Jae-heon’s concern for her awkward, but not unpleasant.</p>
