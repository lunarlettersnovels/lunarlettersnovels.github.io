            <p><strong>Chapter 15.1</strong></p>
<p>“Jae-heon’s long fingers explored her. He crushed her clitor<em>s and pushed his fingertips through the hole. She trembled as he fing</em>red her.</p>
<p>“Ahh, ugh… No, no, I don’t… mm.”</p>
<p>“Don’t like it? There’s a flood in you.”</p>
<p>As he stirred her torn flesh with his middle finger, her walls tightened involuntarily around it. Jae-heon pushed his finger deeper.</p>
<p>“Don’t… I don’t like that… ugh.”</p>
<p>“But you’re leaking everywhere. You sure you don’t like it?”</p>
<p>He chuckled as he buried his long finger deep into her tight hole.</p>
<p>“No, no… Ah, ugh!”</p>
<p>Her whole body shuddered as Jae-heon’s touch grew rougher. He thrust his finger deeper, stimulating her intensely. She suppressed her moans and exhaled deeply.</p>
<p>“Ah, ugh. Stop… Ah, ugh.”</p>
<p>Though he only stirred with a finger, her love juices flowed continuously, and her legs involuntarily crossed. She squeezed her thighs together and twisted her body. His lips curled fiercely upwards.</p>
<p>“I haven’t had s*x in a long time, so there’s a lot built up.” “With his fingers, Jae-heon whispered softly as he continually teased the narrow hole.</p>
<p>“Today, I’ve set aside some time after a long while. Planning to unwind all night.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s voice was gentle and deep, yet the implications were shamelessly coarse.</p>
<p>“I’m worried I might break you if I do it my way.”</p>
<p>His gentle tone sounded polite, but the content was anything but gentlemanly.</p>
<p>Caught in the gaze of a relaxed predator, silence filled with fear washed over her. Her body stiffened, but she didn’t think to escape. She felt like a herbivore whose throat had been bitten off by a vicious beast.</p>
<p>“What should I do with you?”</p>
<p>He pressed his index finger firmly against the rounded clitor*s above the split hole. Silence trembled as if electrified. Without pause, he rubbed the entrance while firmly pressing and teasing the swollen clitoris.</p>
<p>“I’ve never been in the lobby for 40 minutes straight.”</p>
<p>Each time the clitor*s was pressed, it squirted love juices from the hole. Squish, squelch. The sounds from the hole became sticky, and panties soaked with the liquid flowing down the finger.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait to see how you turn me on in bed.”</p>
<p>As the warm finger soaked in love juices, the narrow flesh tightly gripped the finger with each breath she took, mixing her moans with the sounds of her exhales, irresistibly stimulating.</p>
<p>“Now, wait a minute. Do it in the bedroom, do it!”</p>
<p>Goyo shouted urgently as the hand that was prodding her folds pulled down her panties.</p>
<p>“I’m going to leave in an hour. It’s a waste to stand here all this time.”</p>
<p>“Huh. “You don’t have to.”</p>
<p>He placed one leg between Goyo’s crotch and lifted it. Silence took shape, riding on his firm thighs. Because he was pushed against the wall, Goyo was unable to move while being held by Jaeheon.</p>
<p>Jaeheon whispered, biting Goyo’s neckline.</p>
<p>“What should we do first?”</p>
<p>He stuck out his tongue and licked her earlobe. Then, I sucked and pulled his earlobe and breathed into his ear, making a sound.</p>
<p>“Ha, just thinking about it makes my d!ck explode. “Do you want to touch it?”</p>
<p>Jaeheon whispered something explicit and obscene in her ear, then took Goyo’s hand and placed it in front of him. Something protruding was placed in the palm of my hand. Even though it was only on the top of my pants, I could vaguely feel the bulk of the hard flesh.</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p>Goyo felt the stimulation coming from his palm and looked up and down with the thought, ‘No way?’</p>
<p>‘… Nonsense.’</p>
<p>The size of the flesh, which could barely fit in one hand, was astonishing. Goyo flexed her fingers and squeezed it, and the flesh squirmed and swelled even more.</p>
<p>Being s<em>xually inexperienced doesn’t mean you’re completely ignorant of s</em>xuality. I at least had a general idea of what a man’s looked like. But it didn’t make sense to hide a pen!s of this size in his pants. She was almost afraid to check it out.</p>
<p>“Honey, if you do this, you’ll be in trouble.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon buried his head in the crook of Go-yo’s neck and let out a low moan.</p>
<p>“You have a knack for teasing.”</p>
<p>Every time he opened his mouth, his hot breath irritated her skin. Where his breath touched, it burned like a scald.</p>
<p>“If s*x were like this, I’d kill..”</p>
<p>“President, wait a minute.”</p>
<p>Goyo removed her hand from Jae-Heon’s waistband and hurriedly pushed him away, but it was too late; he brazenly unbuckled his pants and ripped open the front flap.</p>
