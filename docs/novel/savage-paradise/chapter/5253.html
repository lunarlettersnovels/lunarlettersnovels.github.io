            <p><strong>Chapter 57.1</strong></p>
<p>“I see. Courtesy is something that’s absent in someone like Prosecutor Ma Soon-jin, who barges into someone else’s house without permission.”</p>
<p>At Jae-heon’s words, the man’s expression hardened. It seemed he was quite flustered not only because his identity had been revealed but also because Kwon Jae-heon knew his name.</p>
<p>However, the one who was truly taken aback was Goyo.</p>
<p>‘This man is a prosecutor?’</p>
<p>When the man hadn’t revealed his identity, Goyo had subconsciously thought he might be a reporter. There were often people digging into past cases for exclusive stories, especially since this incident involved a presidential candidate.</p>
<p>She never would have imagined he was a prosecutor.</p>
<p>‘Why would a prosecutor tell me not to trust Yi-taek?’</p>
<p>It made no sense at all. All the prosecutors she knew had a favorable view of Yi-taek, as he was a politician with a background in law.</p>
<p>Yi-taek had suddenly left the prosecution service with political ambitions during the year he was considered a strong candidate for the next Prosecutor General. He then joined the Korean Party and built a career as a three-term congressman without any setbacks. Perhaps due to his good management of his seniors and juniors, he garnered significant support from prosecutors, and many prosecutors were aligned under him.</p>
<p>Could this be someone sent by Yi-taek? Is he trying to find out how I’m doing? If so, he could just say that the congressman asked him to come…</p>
<p>Goyo looked at Ma Soon-jin with suspicion. She couldn’t read his true intentions.</p>
<p>“Did you pretend not to know who I am, even though you do?” Ma Soon-jin’s lips stiffened awkwardly.</p>
<p>“I asked who you were; I didn’t say I didn’t know,” Jae-heon let out a snicker. “As you know, our family isn’t close with prosecutors.”</p>
<p>“You seem to have a lot to hide.”</p>
<p>“I’d be disappointed if you didn’t say that. Do you know how much tax I paid this year? You’re living off my money too, Prosecutor.”</p>
<p>“I’m grateful for that,” Ma Soon-jin nodded, seemingly in agreement with Jae-heon’s provocative remark.</p>
<p>“What was someone like you doing here?”</p>
<p>“As you can see, I was just admiring the KJ Tower, which has been gilded. I thought that by the next time I came, it would have the leisure to look around.”</p>
<p>“Do you think there will be a next time?” Jae-heon’s lips curled up menacingly. Ma Soon-jin chuckled softly as he gazed at Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“If there is, it certainly won’t be a situation where we’re meeting and smiling like this, will it?”</p>
<p>“Are you hinting at a search warrant?”</p>
<p>“If that’s how it sounds to you, it seems you have a lot to hide. While it seems the director is very much looking forward to it, unfortunately, there are no plans for that yet.”</p>
<p>Goyo felt suffocated by the tension between the two men. Although they were smiling on the surface, the content of their conversation was anything but friendly.</p>
<p>“Why are you reacting so sensitively? I came here purely to enjoy myself today. Ah, I’ve heard that the night view from the director’s office is breathtaking. I’d love to see it. Being on the 60th floor must feel like having the view from the 63 Building’s observatory.”</p>
<p>Ma Soon-jin raised his index finger and pointed upward.</p>
<p>“If you want to see it, bring a warrant,” Jae-heon spoke slowly, trying to grasp Ma Soon-jin’s intentions. He was curious about what he was trying to provoke him for, as if he were trying to divert his attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>What is he trying to hide?</p>
<p>“Do I need a warrant just to see the night view?”</p>
<p>Ma Soon-jin feigned innocence, as if surprised that Jae-heon would be provoked. He then rambled on about how standing in front of the large window in the office would make one feel like Seoul was in the palm of their hand.</p>
<p>“I thought KJ would break world records by building a super-tall building. A 60-story building feels a bit disappointing.”</p>
<p>“If I had known you would be disappointed, I might have put in a bit more effort,” Jae-heon replied nonchalantly with a bored expression.</p>
<p>KJ Tower was built to showcase wealth without being overly ostentatious. His father, Kwon Moo-young, had shouted about building a nonsensical 200-story building, but Jae-heon insisted that 60 stories was just right. Instead, he put considerable effort into the architectural design.</p>
<p>But surely, the prosecutor wouldn’t be genuinely disappointed about the height. He probably understood that there was enough black money hidden to build the world’s tallest building, or something along those lines.</p>
<p>Dealing with someone who speaks in circles to gauge the other party is exhausting. Especially when it’s unclear what their intentions are, one must be cautious with their words. You never know what kind of leverage they might find later.</p>
<p>“Ha, I’m starting to get bored. Are you going to stay here, Prosecutor?”</p>
<p>Irritation crept into Jae-heon’s voice.</p>
