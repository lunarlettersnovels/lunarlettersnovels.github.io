        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 58.1</strong></p>
<p>“The new sofa in the office is a handmade piece crafted with care by an Italian artisan. The leather is definitely of high quality, so, um, maybe we could try it out there…”</p>
<p>“…P-please stop.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s eyes trembled slightly. Surely, the Italian artisan didn’t create the sofa for the purpose of sx. Please, let sxual acts be confined to the bedroom, not the entrance, the sofa, or the dining table.</p>
<p>Feeling Ma Soon-jin’s gaze, Goyo’s face flushed.</p>
<p>“I’ll take my leave. Enjoy yourselves.”</p>
<p>Ma Soon-jin chuckled softly, raising his palm as if to signal he was done, and stepped back.</p>
<p>“Just to be clear, public indecency is punishable by law. Simply exposing your body in public can lead to imprisonment for up to one year or a fine of up to five million won, as well as detention or a fine. I just wanted you to be aware.”</p>
<p>Prosecutor Ma remained unfazed, pushing further without a change in his expression. This only twisted Jae-heon’s mood further.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, this is my private space.”</p>
<p>“I believe this is a corporate building. If you misuse it for personal purposes, you will be penalized.”</p>
<p>“Typical of a prosecutor…”</p>
<p>He never backs down. Jae-heon scoffed.</p>
<p>To tell someone to enjoy themselves while simultaneously warning against indecent acts—what kind of paradox is that? It’s like letting a drunk person take the wheel and then arresting them for drunk driving.</p>
<p>Are they trying to create a crime just to lock me up? They are certainly not the kind of people I want to deal with.</p>
<p>“What I said earlier was sincere.”</p>
<p>Ma Soon-jin spoke vaguely. Mentioning public indecency, it sounded like he was addressing Jae-heon, but Goyo understood. Ma Soon-jin’s gaze lingered briefly on her clutch bag before returning to her. It was a signal that if she wanted to know the truth about the kidnapping case, she should reach out.</p>
<p>“Have a good time, as long as it doesn’t violate the law.”</p>
<p>Ma Soon-jin smiled as he turned away. Soon, he disappeared into the crowd of passersby.</p>
<p>“…I don’t like this.”</p>
<p>Ma Soon-jin.</p>
<p>He belonged to the Anti-Corruption and Strong Investigation Department, where only the top elites among prosecutors gathered. This department independently investigates criminal activities, focusing on uncovering the corruption of large corporations and high-ranking officials. Among them, Ma Soon-jin was notorious for his fierce reputation.</p>
<p>Recently, he had reportedly taken down a well-known food company. It was said to have happened during an investigation into a new drug case.</p>
<p>Corporate corruption and drug crimes. Now, it seemed he was even digging into a famous politician who had once been part of their circle. What a troublesome character he must be.</p>
<p>“Who on earth is that prosecutor?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon seemed to know Ma Soon-jin well. Goyo couldn’t help but be curious about his identity.</p>
<p>“Do you like that prosecutor?”</p>
<p>He was known as the ‘mad dog’ of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office. What reason could he have for approaching you?</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? This is the first time I’ve seen him.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have a preference for public servants, do you?”</p>
<p>Is it just because you like him? Is he just another guy who’s taken a liking to you? That would be easier to accept.</p>
<p>What kind of scent did he pick up that made him barge in here without a second thought?</p>
<p>“I didn’t even know that guy was a prosecutor.”</p>
<p>Goyo was taken aback by Jae-heon’s sudden questioning. What on earth had she done to deserve this? Men approached her even when she was just standing still. What she wanted to know was why Prosecutor Ma Soon-jin was reopening a case that had already been closed.</p>
<p>“Prosecutors have bad tempers. Just look at congressman.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like prosecutors.”</p>
<p>Having grown up under Lee Yi-taek, the mere thought of prosecutors made her shudder.</p>
<p>‘That prosecutor from earlier was quite clever.’</p>
<p>If he had introduced himself as a prosecutor from the start, she would have run away without looking back, without even considering what Ma Soon-jin had to say.</p>
<p>“Hmm, if you don’t like prosecutors, why are you so curious about that guy? Don’t be curious. I’m better looking, taller, in better shape, and I probably have a bigger… you know. I also have more money.”</p>
<p>“That’s not… uh, what are you doing?!”</p>
<p>Jae-heon lifted her by the waist. He then sat her down facing him on his thigh, wrapping his arms tightly around her waist. Her legs, spread wide, trembled slightly.</p>
<p>“It’ll be hard to find someone better than me, so just look at me.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s lips brushed against hers, almost touching. With every word he spoke, his long eyelashes fluttered, making her heart race. He was indeed a remarkable man, just as he claimed.</p>
<p>“You look good in that dress.”</p>
<p>His fingertips gently scratched and caressed Goyo’s bare back. Today, she wore a halter neck dress that left her arms and back exposed, secured with a strap around her neck. The design flared out at the hem, making it easy for her to sit facing him with her legs apart.</p>
<p>“I can’t even tell if you’re teasing me.”</p>
<p>The flesh of Goyo’s backside jiggled beneath her. Thanks to the voluminous skirt, the indecent situation was known only to them.</p>
<p>“W-what on earth… is he…?”</p>
<p>Goyo felt flustered. Although it was out of sight, she could feel the hardness forming beneath her in real-time.</p>
