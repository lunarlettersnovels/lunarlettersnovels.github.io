            <p><strong>Chapter 43.1</strong></p>
<p>“You can have a drink when you’re older. I’ll make you some cocoa later.”</p>
<p>“Th-Then let me wash up first.”</p>
<p>Goyo pleaded with desperate eyes, but it was no use. Instead, he responded in a slow, teasing voice, full of mischief.</p>
<p>“You’ll just end up messy again. Let’s finish this first. Oh, I see—you want to do it in the bathroom? We can start here and continue while washing up.”</p>
<p>“Please… Let’s just go inside.”</p>
<p>“Let’s just get away from the entrance.”</p>
<p>“Stay still for a second, that could’ve been a mistake.”</p>
<p>“W-Where are you… ah—”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s hand, which had been supporting her from below, traced a slow path down, teasingly exploring as if testing her reactions.</p>
<p>“Ah… ngh.”</p>
<p>A shiver ran through her body like a spark, making her tense instinctively. Her arms tightened around his neck.</p>
<p>“If you want something, just say it.”</p>
<p>“Hah… that’s—”</p>
<p>His touch lingered, deliberate and unhurried, as if savoring her every reaction. Her body trembled at the warmth pressing against her, responding before she could think.</p>
<p>Her mind told her to push him away, but her body held onto him just as tightly.</p>
<p>Jae-heon chuckled, as if reading her every thought. His teasing only grew bolder, making it impossible for her to resist any longer.</p>
<p>“P-Please… just…”</p>
<p>“What was that?”</p>
<p>“Please… just do it already.”</p>
<p>Goyo buried her face in his shoulder, her breath uneven. The deep scent of his perfume mixed with his natural warmth, making her dizzy with sensation.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you mean. You’ll have to say it properly.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon held her hips firmly, pressing against her teasingly, his voice laced with mischief.</p>
<p>“…Please…”</p>
<p>His lips curled into a slow smirk as he waited, wanting her full surrender.</p>
<p>“Please… put it in.”</p>
<p>She leaned her face against his shoulder and begged. Nuzzling her nose into him, she could smell his heavy cologne and his strong male scent. It was almost too much to bear.</p>
<p>“What? You have to say it right for me to understand.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s glans pressed firmly against her p*ssy.</p>
<p>“C*ck…”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>Jae-Heon pressed his glans against her entrance and curled his lips lasciviously. It was a naughty question, hoping the perfect silence would surrender.</p>
<p>“Put your c<em>ck in my p</em>ssy…”</p>
<p>She grabbed Jae-heon’s neck and pleaded.</p>
<p>The glans, covered in sticky fluid, slithered out of the opening and stretched the v*ginal walls. Goyo shuddered at the memory of the painful tearing of flesh at the first penetration.</p>
<p>She braced herself and caught her breath as the slippery shaft slid into her hole and slapped her in the gut. The thick column of flesh stretched her inside, sending chills down her spine.</p>
<p>“Now it goes in easily.”</p>
<p>“Ha, ugh, ahh..”</p>
<p>Goyo instinctively clenched down on his length that had penetrated her from beneath. Goyo’s breath caught in her throat at the foreign sensation that filled her. She was paralyzed by the intoxicating pleasure of his scent.</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon moaned lowly, staring into the silence. His eyes took in the sight of Goyo’s face, out of focus with pleasure. He could see her panting, covered in his cum.</p>
<p>“So, baby, what do you want me to do now, huh?”</p>
<p>A solid pillar of flesh squeezed into the narrow opening. It was so hot where it touched her that she couldn’t think straight. Her hole, which had already gotten used to the taste of his length after only a day, clenched and squirted out her juices.</p>
<p>“Come on..”</p>
<p>Goyo had never thought s’d be begging for s*x.</p>
<p>Jae-Heon still hadn’t stopped thrusting into her, and knowing what more he could do, she had no choice but to cling to him.</p>
<p>“As you wish.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon lifted her up. His thick shaft scraped against her walls, sliding in and out, then slamming in hard. Her body jerked from the bottom to the top in an instant.</p>
<p>Puck, puck, puck. His hips followed. There was a loud slap of flesh, and her body jerked and shook as she embraced his manhood. Her eyes turned white as he pushed through her hole and pounded into her belly.</p>
<p>“Ha, ha… ugh.”</p>
<p>A moan escaped her lips with each downward thrust. Goyo bucked her hips against him, unconsciously, and when she let out a sob, Jae-heon’s movements intensified.</p>
<p>“You like that?”</p>
<p>Withdrawing his manhood until the glans was lodged in her entrance, Jae-heon stared into her face and moved his hips seductively, thrusting inside her. A wet gurgling sound resounded as he slid in and out of the soaked slit.</p>
<p>“Mmmmm, haah…… haah!”</p>
