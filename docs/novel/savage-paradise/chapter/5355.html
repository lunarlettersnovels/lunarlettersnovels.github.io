            <p><strong>Chapter 4.2</strong></p>
<p>At the unexpected address, Goyo gasped, inhaling sharply.</p>
<p><em>Mother? Did he just call that woman mother? She wasn’t his lover; she was his stepmother.</em> Lee Yoon-gun, who exactly did you mess with?</p>
<p>“Ugh, why, why weren’t you…! Why did you let them do this to me?!” Lee Yoon-gun shouted with a voice filled with injustice. He is a person who doesn’t know how to repent.</p>
<p>Goyo tried to shake off Lee Yoon-gun, who was grabbing her ankle and throwing a tantrum, but the more she struggled, the stronger his grip became. Since Goyo was the only one on his side here, Lee Yoon-gun clung desperately to her. Her body wavered under his strength.</p>
<p>Observing Lee Yoon-gun’s tantrum, the man smirked sharply. “Look, if my father came, you’d be dumped in the water offshore. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>With a face that could fit in a romantic movie but words that belonged in a noir film, the man tilted his head and alternated between looking at Lee Yoon-gun and Goyo. It was as if he was observing animals in a zoo, with a subtle smile playing on his lips.</p>
<p>“Ugh, mur- murder is a cr- crime! You thugs!”</p>
<p>―Stuff him into a drum, pour in cement, let it set, and throw him in the ocean!</p>
<p>Perhaps hearing Lee Yoon-gun’s threat, a string of harsh curses erupted through the receiver. It sounded like a suggestion to put Lee Yoon-gun in a drum, pour cement over him, let it solidify, and then throw him into the sea.</p>
<p>“The old man is still reasonable. Oh, did you hear? No need for interpretation.”</p>
<p>The man removed the phone from his ear and gestured towards Goyo. It was a signal for her to stop before it was too late. His slow speech and actions revealed his annoyance and impatience.</p>
<p>“Damn it, what did I, what did I do wrong…”</p>
<p>Goyo’s pupils shook mercilessly at Lee Yoon-gun’s unyielding spirit. If she left that person alone like this, it seemed like not only Lee Yoon-gun but also she herself would end up in a drum in the sea. Goyo slumped down and covered Lee Yoon-gun’s mouth with her hand.</p>
<p>“Shut up, Yoon-gun! I’m sorry. My brother’s head got severely injured. He is not in his right mind.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh. F-f…”</p>
<p>“For God’s sake, please be quiet.” Goyo pleaded Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>Close up, his face looked even more pitiful. Blood flowing from his forehead mixed with tears and mucus, making a mess. Even with his face in this state, he wanted to say everything.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh, what, what the hell, w-what’s the deal with that bastard!”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun leaned on Goyo’s body like a support and staggered to his feet, mumbling like a zombie. He wiped the blood blocking his vision with the back of his hand and exhaled heavily.</p>
<p>“Ugh, what the… I heard him say something about sucking d*ck.”</p>
<p>“We’re not involved with each other in any way.” Goyo’s voice was as cold as ice, devoid of any warmth. Goyo moved forward, supporting him. The short distance felt like miles.</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun grabbed Goyo’s shoulders and shook her. It hurt as if her shoulders were breaking, but Goyo had no strength to shake off his strong grip. Her body wavered.</p>
<p>“You think I’m joking? Do you find this funny? Damn it, you son of a b*tch! Always acting like you know everything!”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun began to convulse. Perhaps from being hit hard enough to feel like his head was splitting, the madman became even more unhinged.</p>
<p>“That look! You always… look at me like that. With that pathetic expression, as if I’m pitiful enough to die!”</p>
<p><em>It’s not me who’s pathetic, it’s you. But you wouldn’t know that would you? Showing your face smashed in, head split open, and pissing yourself, you’d feel ashamed.</em></p>
<p>“Goyo, Goyo, Goyo! Aaagh, aagh!”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun clung to her, thrashing about, and the blood and filth covering his body began to soil her. Goyo’s stomach churned at the smell emanating from him. She had to force herself to suppress the rising urge to vomit.</p>
<p>“Oh, f*… It hurts so much… Argh!”</p>
<p>“I get it. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Their dragging footsteps left dirty marks on the marble floor. As Lee Yoon-gun’s legs gave out, causing him to lose balance, Goyo’s fragile body swayed along with him.</p>
<p>“Y-you should have protected me! You…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You’re just my dog!”</p>
<p>More uncomfortable than Lee Yoon-gun’s persistent clinging was the man staring at her as if he were pitying her.</p>
<p>It was somewhat fortunate. The man was looking not at her disappointed face but at her back.</p>
