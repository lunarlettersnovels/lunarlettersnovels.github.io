            <p><strong>Chapter 25.2</strong></p>
<p><em>December 25th, 11:30 p.m.</em></p>
<p>Han-young Hospital VIP Room.</p>
<p>Though she arrived at the hospital before midnight, Goyo couldn’t bring herself to enter. Moans of pleasure were seeping out from behind the hospital room door.</p>
<p>“Ahh, mmm.”</p>
<p>Inside the room, a naked woman lay beneath Yoon-gun, who was also completely nude. With each thrust of his hips, the woman twisted her body, making sultry sounds.</p>
<p>“…No way.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s mouth fell open involuntarily at the intimate scene visible through the partially opened door.</p>
<p>A month was already a long time to endure Lee Yoon-gun’s personality, but she never expected him to bring a woman to the hospital room for such lewd acts. Even if it was a private VIP room, there were medical staff at the desk at the end of the corridor.</p>
<p>The suddenly unfolding explicit scene made Goyo’s mind go blank. The dimly lit hospital room looked like a theater stage viewed from a dark auditorium.</p>
<p>Watching the intimate scene between a naked man and woman was uncomfortable. She couldn’t just stand there dumbly. She didn’t know when their indulgence would end, and more importantly, voyeurism wasn’t her style. She needed to leave before Yoon-gun, distracted by his intimate encounter, noticed her arrival.</p>
<p>As Goyo let out a deep sigh and quietly stepped back, Yoon-gun spoke as if he had been waiting.</p>
<p>“A dog should guard its master. Where do you think you’re going!”</p>
<p>The man’s voice, filled with irritation, stopped Goyo’s footsteps.</p>
<p>“Yoon-gun, raising a dog?”</p>
<p>The woman, who had just been moaning and whimpering, now sounded surprisingly bright. Goyo bit her lower lip and closed her eyes tightly. Was she really asking out of ignorance?</p>
<p>Most people who knew Yoon-gun were aware that the ‘dog’ he kept was a woman named Lee Goyo.</p>
<p>“Unnie, want to hear an interesting story?”</p>
<p>“What story?”</p>
<p>Goyo glanced at the woman on the bed. Calling her ‘unnie’ suggested she was an older woman, as usual for his taste.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to severe attachment issues, Yoon-gun had always dated women older than himself since childhood. Even Min, with whom he had a secret meeting at Han-young Resort a month ago, was an older woman.</p>
<p>“I was kidnapped when I was ten.”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun suddenly brought up a story from 14 years ago.</p>
<p>“I was trapped in a moldy semi-basement room with a palm-sized window. There was a church right in front. I could hear hymns.”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun hummed the hymn he remembered and began moving his hips to the rhythm. The woman lifted her legs, wrapped them around his waist, and twisted her body, moaning.</p>
<p>“I thought I’d be rescued soon. As you know, I’m quite brave.”</p>
<p>Was there a church in front of our house?</p>
<p>Goyo’s memories were hazy. She could only vaguely recall someone shouting in a narrow room, and a physical struggle so intense that household items were destroyed.</p>
<p>“Oh, I think I remember. Breaking news was on TV all day.”</p>
<p>“Well, yes.”</p>
<p>“Wait, how did it go exactly? The memory is fuzzy.”</p>
<p>“The result was obvious. Kidnapping a prosecutor’s son in South Korea was unthinkable. They weren’t idiots.”</p>
<p>The case of a prosecutor’s son being kidnapped. Ultimately, the police special forces successfully rescued Yoon-gun. The distinctive aspect was how, unlike typical kidnapping cases, this incident was extensively covered by the media.</p>
<p>[The kidnapping of a prosecutor’s child is not someone else’s problem. Our children are in danger.]</p>
<p>[Over 10,000 child disappearance reports annually. With child disappearances increasing yearly, government measures are urgently needed…]</p>
<p>[The current state of organ trafficking. South Korea is no longer a safe zone.]</p>
<p>The reporting was so extensive that it was etched into the national consciousness. The public, consumed by anxiety and anger, ultimately concluded that ‘the vicious criminal who kidnapped children deserved to die.’</p>
<p>“If it weren’t for me, she would have been dragged to China, had all his organs harvested, and died.”</p>
<p>“She?”</p>
<p>“In other words, I’m her lifesaver. That’s not all.”</p>
<p>To the woman, Yoon-gun’s words seemed incoherent.</p>
<p>In fact, these rambling words were not meant for the s*x partner writhing beneath him.</p>
<p>They were directed at Goyo, who was standing there casually listening, as if nothing was unusual.</p>
