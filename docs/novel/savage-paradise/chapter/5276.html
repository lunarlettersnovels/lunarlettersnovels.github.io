            <p><strong>Chapter 45.2</strong></p>
<p>“Haah, nn, …ah—ahng.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s body had already adjusted to his rhythm. With every thrust from Jae-heon, she wrapped her arms around his neck, moved her hips in sync, and tightened around him.</p>
<p>The sensation of being filled to the deepest part of her womb made her shudder and moan without pause.</p>
<p>His slick, glistening length moved in and out without rest. Every time he thrust upward, fluid burst from where they were joined, splashing messily in all directions. The thin liquid that trailed down his shaft dripped steadily onto the floor, soaking into the tiles and darkening their color.</p>
<p>In the bedroom.</p>
<p>Thud. Thwack. The sound of skin meeting skin echoed repeatedly. Jae-heon thrust in hard enough for his hips to slap against her backside with force.</p>
<p>“Ahh… ah, mm…”</p>
<p>She had no idea how long they’d been going at it.</p>
<p>He took her from behind, then flipped her over, then had her with her legs up in the air. She was being pounded so relentlessly, she began to wonder if her body could even take it. Eventually, the sensation started to blur into numbness.</p>
<p>She had never imagined that s*x could be such an exhausting, full-body ordeal. Her insides churned from the intense motion, and her head spun from the strain.</p>
<p>Still, she didn’t hate it. No—there were moments where she thought, If I died like this, I’d be okay. She didn’t know why these thoughts always came when she was with him.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because they were connected in such an intimate way, skin to skin. Even if they were nothing more than s*x partners, it still felt right.</p>
<p>When she was with him like this, nothing else came to mind. It was the first time anything had ever made her this focused—maybe because the sheer physical effort left no room for stray thoughts.</p>
<p>Earlier that morning, Goyo had blacked out as the sun rose. Of course, she’d already been in and out of consciousness before that.</p>
<p>But now that her eyes were open again, she found herself in the same situation. Time hadn’t reversed… and yet here they were again.</p>
<p>“You’re… so—ah, kuh, hah…”</p>
<p>Her voice had gone hoarse from moaning without a break.</p>
<p>Even then, the steady rhythm of slapping skin continued. Their bodies were locked so tightly it was as if they had always been one. Thrusting, rubbing, grinding, stroking, plunging… then releasing, spilling, climaxing, again and again.</p>
<p>It was hard to believe this was still happening. Still ongoing.</p>
<p>His thickness scraped along her inner walls as he pulled out, only to drive in again. The blunt tip pushed and stirred, pressing against every sensitive spot. With each short, firm stroke, her body opened to fit his shape, then clenched back around him.</p>
<p>on Jae-heon’s stamina was nothing short of monstrous. Just lying there and taking it was exhausting enough, but he had been going at full force for hours. Maybe this was the kind of strength it took to lead such a terrifying organization.</p>
<p>“I… I can’t… can’t anymore… haah, huff…”</p>
<p>She felt like she was going to die.</p>
<p>She’d heard of people dying during s*x before. She always assumed it only happened to older men who ignored their age and pushed themselves too far chasing younger women. But now, in the prime of her youth, she feared she might meet the same end. In a panic, Goyo pushed against Jae-heon with all the strength she could muster.</p>
<p>“Your stamina’s way too low.”</p>
<p>“Huff… ngh… it’s not that I’m weak…”</p>
<p>It’s you, Mr. Kwon Jae-heon. You’re just too much.</p>
<p>Even now, with that overwhelming length thrusting deep inside her, it was hard to stay conscious.</p>
<p>“Who stops mid-thrust? It’s not over until I finish.”</p>
<p>“You… you’re unbelievable… ah, ngh—!”</p>
<p>Whatever was leaking from her right now wasn’t exactly clear, but it definitely wasn’t nothing. Her insides were filled to the brim, and now it was steadily dripping out. Was this still his release—or something else entirely?</p>
<p>“Babe, who brings a conscience into s*x? When you’re turned on, you go for it.”</p>
<p>Somehow, he had found that hidden switch deep inside her, and now he was pressing it relentlessly with that thick, unyielding shaft. Her fingers and toes curled involuntarily; she couldn’t even fight back anymore.</p>
<p>“St-still… there’s a limit… who… who does it like this… so recklessly…”</p>
<p>“I told you, didn’t I? A bastard like me? I go all night.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon gave her a sly, wicked smile, the corners of his eyes crinkling with amusement.</p>
