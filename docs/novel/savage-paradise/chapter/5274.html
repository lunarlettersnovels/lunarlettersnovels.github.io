            <p><strong>Chapter 46.2</strong></p>
<p>One look had lit the fire. One night had fanned it into a blaze. If he ended up shackled to her for the rest of his life, well… he’d have no one to blame but himself.</p>
<p>He exhaled heavily.</p>
<p>Even now, his manhood, having just poured out a flood of release, was still being tightly gripped by her spasming walls. Her body clung to him, milking him as if it didn’t want to let go.</p>
<p>Jae-heon rolled his hips slowly, pressing deep into the trembling flesh that responded to his every move. The pleasure burned through him like fire as their mixed fluids seeped out, soaking the once-pristine white sheets beneath them.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Goyo stirred, her awareness slowly returning. She looked around groggily.</p>
<p>The blackout curtains kept the room in perpetual twilight—there was no way to tell if it was day or night. Not that it mattered. Day and night had blurred together in a haze of passion and sleep. Each time she passed out, she’d wake to more of the same.</p>
<p>Jae-heon pursued her like a creature in mating season, heedless of time or place.</p>
<p>The front door had only been the beginning.</p>
<p>The living room couch, the kitchen table, the shower stall, even the bathtub. At one point, he’d taken her out to the balcony, muffling her moans with his hand for fear the neighbors might hear.</p>
<p>Her whole body reeked of him.</p>
<p>He’d said he’d had a vasectomy, and maybe that was true—but that didn’t stop him from finishing inside her, over her chest, her face… anywhere and everywhere. There wasn’t a single part of her that hadn’t been marked by him.</p>
<p>Like some animal marking his territory.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>December 31st, 8:00 a.m.</p>
<p>“The number saved in slot one—that’s my direct line. Call me anytime.”</p>
<p>“B-Before that, c-could you just… pull out f-first so I can—ahh…”</p>
<p>Each time Jae-heon thrust into her from behind, her breasts rubbed roughly against the edge of the dining table.</p>
<p>“If we’re seeing each other every day, wouldn’t it be weird if you didn’t call? I might get a little offended.”</p>
<p>“I-It’s not like I’d be a-able to answer every ti—mmgh…”</p>
<p>Surely he wasn’t the kind of man who’d lose his mind if she didn’t pick up. There was already one obsessive man in her life—Yoon Geon—and one was more than enough.</p>
<p>“If I get upset, it’ll be hard for you. Think you can handle it?”</p>
<p>She was already struggling to keep up.</p>
<p>Mid-breakfast, Jae-heon had casually handed her a new phone. Same model as his. His was black, hers was white. Just different colors.</p>
<p>Goyo poked around at the new toy, still chewing, chopsticks hanging from her mouth like a distracted child. But her brow furrowed slightly when she saw the first contact saved as: ♡Oppa♡. That was all she did. Just a frown.</p>
<p>But apparently, even that was enough for Jae-heon. He grabbed her and forced her upper body down onto the table. Her phone still in hand, her chest pressed flat against the cool surface.</p>
<p>‘He’s hard.’</p>
<p>She could feel it—his erection pressed up against her from behind. Before she could process anything, her legs parted, almost on instinct. The blunt head nudged her entrance, eased in slightly… and then shoved deep without mercy.</p>
<p>Her body, used to him after a long passionate night, opened up easily. His thick length pushed through the leftover slick, and with each movement, more of it dripped down her thighs.</p>
<p>After going at it all night… they were already doing it again.</p>
<p>Come here.</p>
<p>Let’s wash up.</p>
<p>Let’s eat.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>I’m hard.</p>
<p>Even just hearing those words now sent a shiver down her spine. And if he even so much as glanced toward the front door, her body jolted in anticipation.</p>
<p>“Oh, and another thing—my calls should be answered within three rings.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon thrust in deeper as if punctuation.</p>
<p>“T-That’s a b-bit… extreme… haah.”</p>
<p>Even Yoon Geon hadn’t made such demands.</p>
<p>“Is that too much to ask? I don’t see why you wouldn’t be able to.”</p>
<p>Every time he dug into her, her body shook, and the table scraped against the floor with a sharp screech.</p>
<p>“Y-You’re being unreasonable…”</p>
<p>Even dealing with one Yoon Geon was exhausting.</p>
<p>Thrust. Smack. Thrust. His hips pounded into her so hard she couldn’t speak without moaning.</p>
<p>“I’d be really hurt, you know. With the way things are between us.”</p>
<p>“Haah… A-And what are we, exactly…?”</p>
<p>Goyo genuinely didn’t know.</p>
<p>They had definitely moved beyond a one-night stand—after all, they’d been tangled up in each other nonstop for days.</p>
<p>But were they lovers? That word felt too neat, too normal. All they’d done was do it. No dates to trendy restaurants, no spontaneous weekend trips.</p>
<p>They weren’t strangers… but they weren’t something special either.</p>
<p>She couldn’t tell what they were anymore.</p>
