            <p><strong>Chapter 22.2</strong></p>
<p>Officially, she and Lee Yoon-gun were siblings. Though they shared no blood and no affection, they were a fake family.</p>
<p>“It seems like he thinks differently.” Jae-heon raised his eyebrows and shifted the phone in his hand. “He’s asking if you have been intimate with someone.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“A brother curious about his sister in an inappropriate way…” He muttered, eyes still fixed on the screen.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about!”</p>
<p>Goyo’s pupils shook at his shocking words. How could Jae-heon know the content of Yoon-gun’s messages? A short call wouldn’t give him that much information.</p>
<p>‘Wait, whose phone is that?’</p>
<p>Goyo looked down, searching for her phone. She had just been holding it, checking messages…</p>
<p>‘It’s gone.’</p>
<p>She stared at her empty hand, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>“W-wait, is that my phone?” Her voice trembled uncontrollably. “Were you just looking at my messages? How could you…!”</p>
<p>“You left it on the table.”</p>
<p>“When did I do that? I was holding it!”</p>
<p>‘When did he take it?’</p>
<p>He must have snatched it while she was distracted and now claimed it had been on the table all along.</p>
<p>“G-give it back!” Her face and neck flushed with heat. Goyo’s message app was filled with lewd and unspeakable texts. And Jae-heon had seen them all?</p>
<p>“And don’t misunderstand. Lee Yoon-gun… he’s not usually like this. He’s just… on edge because I’m here with you.”</p>
<p>No brother, fake or not, would normally speak such vile words to his sister. If it were real, he wouldn’t have such disgusting desires.</p>
<p>“Are you really defending him right now?”</p>
<p>“It’s not an excuse…”</p>
<p>Goyo wanted to cry.</p>
<p>Everything was Lee Yoon-gun’s one-sided feelings and unattainable desires. A lot of horrible things had happened between her and Lee Yoon-gun, but she didn’t want to delve into the details.</p>
<p>More than that, she felt mortified that someone, even a one-night companion, had seen this side of her.</p>
<p>As if mocking her misery, her phone buzzed loudly.</p>
<p>“Are you going to answer it?”</p>
<p>He asked, gently shaking the vibrating phone. The name ‘Lee Yoon-gun’ was clearly displayed on the lit-up screen.</p>
<p>Buzz, buzz.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>Buzz, buzz.</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun still desired her, and Kwon Jae-heon knows it.</p>
<p>Answering would only make things worse.</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun would throw a fit, and the man before her would mock her. She didn’t want to be humiliated any further.</p>
<p>“…” Goyo silently shook her head.</p>
<p>“Good decision.”</p>
<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Jae-heon held down the end button to power off the phone and tossed it onto the table. Then he gave her a casual smile.</p>
<p>“Indulging brats only spoils them.”</p>
<p>It seemed Kwon Jae-heon knew a lot about her and her circumstances. There was no need to pretend or act tough anymore.</p>
<p>‘Your brother and my father are connected, and your father kindly sent his daughter to me.’</p>
<p>‘What should I call this? A twisted family?’</p>
<p>He treated her like an animal, degrading and humiliating her, yet she found herself agreeing with him.</p>
<p>A twisted family, indeed.</p>
<p>Goyo thought there was no better term to describe herself and the people around her.</p>
<p>“Mind if I smoke?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon took out a cigarette from a pack beside his glass and placed it in his mouth. Before she could respond, he lit it.</p>
<p>He was going to smoke regardless, so why even ask? She wanted to remind him it was a non-smoking area but kept quiet.</p>
<p>“Thought you might allow it.”</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair, exhaling smoke in a leisurely manner. The dim lighting made the wisps of smoke look almost ethereal.</p>
<p>Somehow, everything he did seemed elegant. His relaxed and languid demeanor, captured in the dim light, was like a masterpiece painting.</p>
<p>She sighed and asked, challenging his arrogant air.</p>
<p>“What if I don’t?”</p>
<p>“You don’t like it?”</p>
<p>He relaxed his mouth in surprise. It wasn’t a smirk but an amused smile, which gave her a bit more courage.</p>
<p>“What if I say no?”</p>
<p>“I’d put it out, of course.” Jae-heon took a deep drag, then exhaled a long plume of smoke.</p>
<p>“I always listen to my woman.” He chuckled softly, smoke curling around them as he spoke.</p>
