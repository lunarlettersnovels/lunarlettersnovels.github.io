            <p><strong>Chapter 47.2</strong></p>
<p>A stress-free party prep—at least on the surface.</p>
<p>But one thing was bothering her.</p>
<p>“Will Yoon-gun be there too?”</p>
<p>“Who knows. His legs aren’t broken, so if he wants to show up, he will.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s expression faltered with unease. Jae-heon didn’t seem to like that.</p>
<p>His voice came sharp and low:</p>
<p>“Guess snapping a wrist wasn’t enough. Should’ve gone for the spine, or at least a clean break in the leg. It’s not too late, though. Just say the word.”</p>
<p>He was offering to put Yoon-gun in a wheelchair, as casually as if he were ordering coffee.</p>
<p>Goyo shook her head, clearly disturbed.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to. He probably won’t come anyway.”</p>
<p>Even if Yoon-gun wanted to, Eui-taek would stop him. He was too conscious of appearances to let his injured son show up in public—especially at the same event as Kwon Jae-heon. If the two men ran into each other, Yoon-gun would lose control. No way Eui-taek would risk that.</p>
<p>There was nothing for Goyo to worry about.</p>
<p>“Even if he does show up, you’ll handle it, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon nodded with a light chuckle, as if it were obvious. He turned back to the table in the living room and scanned the lineup of luxury items.</p>
<p>Then his brow furrowed. Something clearly wasn’t to his liking.</p>
<p>“There should be more pieces I ordered.”</p>
<p>Goyo followed his gaze. He was eyeing the display of jewelry with visible discontent.</p>
<p>“Why is this all you brought?”</p>
<p>He snapped at the staff, and Goyo gently tugged at his sleeve, whispering:</p>
<p>“We can just go with the necklace you already gave me.”</p>
<p>“That necklace? No. My pride’s on the line. Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>To Goyo, everything on the table looked beautiful enough. But Jae-heon, as usual, was being particular.</p>
<p>“Mr. Yoon, is this how you do business? Why would I keep working with you?”</p>
<p>“Apologies, sir. The piece you ordered arrived at Incheon Airport early this morning, but due to its high value, customs clearance was delayed. Thankfully, it passed through about an hour ago. The security courier is on their way now.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon didn’t even try to hide his irritation.</p>
<p>“And I’m supposed to sit around waiting because of your poor handling?”</p>
<p>Goyo, standing beside him, looked visibly stunned. Jewelry so expensive that customs held it up?</p>
<p>Just recently, he’d bought her a necklace at auction that cost ten billion won—and she hadn’t even dared to wear it. Now something even more expensive was en route to his house?</p>
<p>She was pale. Wearing something like that felt like inviting death. She’d already told Jae-heon that anything too flashy made her uncomfortable, but he never listened.</p>
<p>“I apologize. But while you wait… would you like to take a look at this piece instead? I thought it might suit your tastes.”</p>
<p>Mr. Yoon, ever the professional, offered a smooth pivot.</p>
<p>Jae-heon narrowed his eyes at her, as if daring her to impress him.</p>
<p>“It’s the Temptation of the Devil limited edition.”</p>
<p>With great care, Yoon opened a small jewelry case the assistant had been holding. Inside, light caught the gem’s surface, scattering dazzling reflections.</p>
<p>Even Goyo recognized it instantly.</p>
<p>The Temptation of the Devil set had recently made waves when a male lead used it to propose in a hit drama. Since then, it had become a dream piece for couples preparing for marriage—something money alone couldn’t easily buy.</p>
<p>And here it was.</p>
<p>The blood-red ruby shimmered und</p>
