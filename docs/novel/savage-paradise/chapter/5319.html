            <p><strong>Chapter 23.2</strong></p>
<p>“I don’t quite understand what you…”</p>
<p>Goyo felt a tingling in her chest.</p>
<p>She knew how pathetic she must look in Kwon Jae-heon’s eyes. Even so, he had no right to interrogate her. Hadn’t he also bought a night with her knowing it was Lee Yi-taek’s scheme?</p>
<p>“I doubt you’re asking because you don’t know. Ms. Lee Goyo, I hate people who lie.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon tapped his cigarette ash into the ashtray.</p>
<p>Now, she had to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Lee Goyo was perfectly his type. Evident in how he’d thrown aside Ji Seo-hyun and moved his hips like a madman.</p>
<p>That’s why he was angry. It irritated him that he, Kwon Jae-heon, was moving according to Lee Yi-taek’s calculations.</p>
<p>Seeing Goyo looking at him with clear eyes twisted his mood.</p>
<p>“What you just said better be the truth.”</p>
<p>At first, he was only irritated with the father, but now the son kept disturbing his mood too. It particularly annoyed him how the other kept calling for the woman who was with him.</p>
<p>Lee Goyo had deliberately dressed up today. To catch his eye. So at least until she leaves this hotel room, Lee Goyo is his.</p>
<p>“One more thing.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon irritably tapped his cigarette ash and brought it to his lips.</p>
<p>“I’m warning you, if you go to Lee Yoon-gun without my permission, you’ll regret it.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon took a deep drag from his cigarette and exhaled a long stream of smoke.</p>
<p>The smoke spread thickly. The cigarette smoke enveloping her triggered a harsh cough.</p>
<p>“Because I’ll make sure of it.”</p>
<p>She should have said if she didn’t like it. The fact that she wouldn’t say anything even while coughing heavily, damn it.</p>
<p>Jae-heon ground out his half-smoked cigarette in the ashtray. He furrowed his brow and gazed down at Goyo intently.</p>
<p>“When you’re with me, you should only think about me.”</p>
<p>Goyo nodded at his words.</p>
<p>“I ordered food thinking you might be hungry, and I’m being mindful while smoking. You shouldn’t let your mind wander.”</p>
<p>While the food ordering part might be true, he hadn’t been particularly mindful about the smoking.</p>
<p>Still, it was a relief that his expression had improved somewhat.</p>
<p>It seemed Lee Yoon-gun was what had irritated him. If she found Lee Yoon-gun annoying, how much worse must it be for Kwon Jae-heon? The two men were already bound by an unfortunate connection.</p>
<p>“You’re thinking of something else again.”</p>
<p>“I… have something I’m curious about.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“How do you deal with your anger, Director?”</p>
<p>She worried about how Kwon Jae-heon would treat her when angry.</p>
<p>When Lee Yoon-gun gets angry, he hits her. He hits her until his anger subsides, leaving Goyo no choice but to endure it without daring to resist.</p>
<p>Everyone must have different ways of handling anger. She asked because she couldn’t tell how Kwon Jae-heon managed his fury.</p>
<p>“Why are you curious about that?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon raised an eyebrow at Goyo’s sudden question. His voice must have come out a bit rough, as Goyo flinched.</p>
<p>“Why are you so tense?”</p>
<p>Goyo was the one who asked how he deals with anger. She was also the one who asked how he relieves stress. Yet here she was, frozen stiff. As if she might burst into tears if he said he beats disobedient people to death.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who asked.”</p>
<p>What had he done? He hadn’t said anything, hadn’t even done anything yet.</p>
<p>Jae-heon let out a long sigh and beckoned to her with his finger.</p>
<p>“Come here.”</p>
<p>“W-why?”</p>
<p>“You asked me to show you.”</p>
<p>When Goyo didn’t move, he grabbed her chair and pulled it toward him. Goyo, dragged along, shuddered and breathed heavily.</p>
<p>Jae-heon sighed deeply once more before slowly speaking.</p>
<p>“You really need a lot of guidance. What, do I have to teach you everything one by one, hm?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Jae-heon lifted her up and sat her on his thigh. The chair Goyo had been sitting on fell backward with a thud.</p>
<p>Seated on his thigh, Goyo’s legs spread wide with his torso between them. The sheet covering her body slipped to the floor, leaving her suddenly naked.</p>
<p>“Eh? Ah!”</p>
<p>The circular chair they sat on spun around until Goyo’s back touched the bar table.</p>
<p>“Stop struggling.”</p>
<p>While she stared at Jae-heon with wide eyes, his aroused flesh touched her entrance. Goyo twisted her body, but with her back against the bar table, she couldn’t move.</p>
<p>“D-Director?”</p>
<p>“Back to ‘Director’ now? How disappointing.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon licked her earlobe. Breathing hot air against it, he spoke shamelessly.</p>
<p>“May I put it in?”</p>
<p>“It’s already coming… ah.”</p>
<p>The blunt tip had already parted her labia and inserted its head.</p>
