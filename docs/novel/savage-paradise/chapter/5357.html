            <p><strong>Chapter 3.2</strong></p>
<p>The man tilted his head arrogantly, gripping Lee Yoon-gun’s hair painfully.</p>
<p>“Agh, let go… You bastard!”</p>
<p>“Popping pills and fooling around must have made you irrational.”</p>
<p>The man yanked on Lee Yoon-gun’s hair roughly, causing his head to snap back.</p>
<p>“For beasts like you, punishment is the medicine.”</p>
<p>With those words, the man mercilessly slammed Lee Yoon-gun’s head onto the ground.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>The sound of the impact, as if a skull had shattered, echoed through the heavy air, engulfing her in a scream akin to a banshee’s.</p>
<p>“Aaagh! Oh, God! You, you bastard! She’s the one… who… who’s lying…”</p>
<p>Now, Goyo wanted to cover his mouth and drag him away.</p>
<p>To blurt out such words even in that state… Lee Yoon-gun’s stubbornness, a trait usually attributed to the weak, was utterly ineffective against the man in front of her.</p>
<p>“Your words are remorseless, and you lack any sense.”</p>
<p>The man grabbed Lee Yoon-gun’s hair and lifted his head. In such situations, one should beg and plead like a worm, but Lee Yoon-gun foolishly continued to provoke the man.</p>
<p>It was like pouring oil on a burning fire, with no hope of salvaging the situation.</p>
<p>“If… If I die, my father won’t leave you alone…”</p>
<p>“Looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>Though his tone sounded soft, his actions did not reflect it. Instead, the grip on Lee Yoon-gun’s hair tightened even more.</p>
<p>“I was deceived by that woman… I’m the victim…”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t care less.” A smirk formed at the corner of the man’s lips. “Whatever you did with that woman, it doesn’t matter to me.”</p>
<p>The man forcefully slammed Lee Yoon-gun’s head to the ground once again.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>“Ow! Stop… I’m only guilty of being deceived… Please, believe me…”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun belatedly tried to explain and justify himself, but there was no sign of the man’s anger abating.</p>
<p>Thwack!</p>
<p>“I lost a fortune. I lost a contract worth over a hundred billion because of one naive brat.”</p>
<p>Thwack!</p>
<p>“Damn it, just for you! I came down here myself. Ha.”</p>
<p>He lifted Lee Yoon-gun’s hair again. His face was covered in blood from his broken forehead and nose.</p>
<p>“Ugh… I… I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>Feeling like he had no other options, Lee Yoon-gun eventually pleaded for forgiveness.</p>
<p>“Now, do you understand what you did wrong?”</p>
<p>“Guh… I… did nothing wrong…”</p>
<p>“You need to say it properly. What did you do wrong?”</p>
<p>When Lee Yoon-gun couldn’t answer properly, he mercilessly slammed his head to the ground again.</p>
<p>Thud. A dull thud echoed as Lee Yoon-gun’s chin was struck, and a stream of sticky blood trickled down his jaw.</p>
<p>“I met her… ugh.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, forget about that. What did I say?”</p>
<p>“She… she made me… do it. Ugh…”</p>
<p>Coughing, Lee Yoon-gun’s mouth burst open, and blood splattered onto the man.</p>
<p>Finally, the man loosened his grip on Lee Yoon-gun’s hair. His head fell weakly to the ground. “I committed a deadly sin. “It would be a sin to have the blood of someone like you on my hands..”</p>
<p>“Cough… gah…”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun whimpered and shuddered, sprawled on the floor as a puddle of yellowish liquid spread around him. With an indifferent gaze, the man rose to his feet as if he had finished his business. He took out a handkerchief from his pocket, wiped his blood-stained hand, and casually tossed it aside.</p>
<p>Every inch of Goyo’s body trembled. Fear had engulfed her–this time, Lee Go-yeon messed with the wrong people. She clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug into her palms.</p>
<p>“As soon as you arrive, make sure the woman enters the car you came in. Make it look like she has never been to Cheongdo.”</p>
<p>Now, she understood why Yi-taek had given such instructions. This adultery must not be discovered at any cost. But once the scene of infidelity was caught on the spot, hiding the woman became impossible.</p>
<p>The line of salvageable actions had already been crossed.</p>
<p>None of Yi-taek’s instructions were easy to carry out. Yoon-gun’s safety, and even her own safety, were not assured.</p>
<p>If Yoon-gun hadn’t touched another woman like a rabid dog in heat, none of this would have happened. Goyo’s resentful eyes turned towards Yoon-gun. In his state, he needed to be transferred to the hospital immediately.</p>
