            <p><strong>Chapter 24.1</strong></p>
<p>“I wasn’t like this before, but I’ve lost my patience.”</p>
<p>His swollen glans was dripping pre-cum, trying to bury itself in her passage that had become tight with time.</p>
<p>“Have you ever tried being patient?”</p>
<p>“As you can see, I’m not the type to get rejected anywhere.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon guided Goyo’s arms behind her to grip the bar table.</p>
<p>“…I thought as much.”</p>
<p>He knows he’s handsome. With that face, he couldn’t not know, but using his good weapons well was another matter entirely.</p>
<p>Young, handsome, and a wealthy mature man exuding masculine charm.</p>
<p>Goyo couldn’t resist his appeal either.</p>
<p>“With that face, anyone would fall for your seduct… nngh.”</p>
<p>Goyo gripped the table edge like a support and breathed heavily. His member pushed slowly into her opening. The innocent chair creaked.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you like my face too.”</p>
<p>“N-not the type to get… ugh… rejected…”</p>
<p>As if I’m any different.</p>
<p>‘I was confident I wouldn’t fall for a man’s looks.’</p>
<p>Unlike their terrible personalities, both Lee Yi-taek and Lee Yoon-gun possessed outstanding appearances.</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek’s looks played a significant role in his public popularity. In his youth, his sharp charm won support from younger generations, and in middle age, his dignity attracted middle-aged and older supporters. His female support base was particularly solid compared to other candidates.</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun was the same. She had witnessed countless women who were deceived by his looks, offering their bodies and hearts, only to end up broken.</p>
<p>Seeing them, she had sworn not to be fooled by a man’s appearance, yet how did it come to this?</p>
<p>“You said we’d eat… ahh.”</p>
<p>“Just until the food arrives.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon gripped her thighs firmly. Then he lifted her body slightly and slammed her down toward his center with an audible thud. His member, which had been scraping against her walls, buried itself deep inside her in an instant, striking her depths.</p>
<p>The question ‘Will that food actually arrive today?’ scattered into the air along with her moans.</p>
<p>Thud-, thud, thud-. Each time their lower bodies separated and reunited, his flesh column withdrew to the tip before plunging back in to the base, churning her walls. Her desperate sex squeezed and gripped him mercilessly.</p>
<p>“Want to stick out your tongue? So I can kiss you.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon said, lightly licking Goyo’s lips. Earlier he had bitten her lips and forced his way in as he pleased, but now his tone was gentle.</p>
<p>But his actions weren’t as gentle as his tone. As soon as Goyo timidly stuck out her tongue, he roughly captured it. While ravaging her mouth as if trying to pull her tongue out from its root, below, his burning member stirred her insides.</p>
<p>“Haa, ah, aah.”</p>
<p>The acrid taste of tobacco lingered on his tongue tip. Jae-heon’s breath and saliva traveled down Goyo’s throat.</p>
<p>“My face is nice, but you prefer my c*ck more, don’t you?”</p>
<p>He thrust while pressing their lips together, breathing into her. Wet, squelching sounds emanated endlessly from both above and below.</p>
<p>“…ah, ahh.”</p>
<p>“Answer me, baby.”</p>
<p>His gaze never left Goyo’s face. As if not wanting to miss even the slightest change in her expression.</p>
<p>Goyo’s pupils dilated, her moans grew louder, and her sex quivered. In response, the movement of his veined member grew increasingly rough.</p>
<p>“Which do you like better, my face or my c*ck? Ah, can’t choose? You like it all?”</p>
<p>“Haa, haah.”</p>
<p>The chair’s creaking intensified, and the sticky fluid clinging to his shaft as it withdrew from her entrance stretched viscously. Their pubic hair tangled messily as he pressed and prodded, leaving Goyo unable to gather her thoughts. As she twisted her body while moaning, her excited opening repeatedly clenched tight around his member.</p>
<p>“Whew, no need for an answer.”</p>
<p>She wouldn’t be squeezing this tight if she disliked it.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to her tight grip, Jae-heon’s breathing grew rough.</p>
<p>The chair shook and her back hit the bar table. Thud- thud, clink clank. The sound of rattling glasses mixed strangely with the wet sounds of flesh, tickling their ears.</p>
<p>Click-.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaotic movement, something cold and metallic touched her neck, followed by the sound of a clasp. Goyo trembled as she looked down at her neck.</p>
<p>“…W-what’s this?”</p>
<p>A familiar necklace hung around her neck.</p>
<p>It was the same necklace Jae-heon had won at auction for 1 billion won just hours ago.</p>
<p>“It’s a gift.”</p>
