            <p><strong>Chapter 26.1</strong></p>
<p>“I asked our dad to bring her home and raise her.”</p>
<p>After being rescued, Yoon-gun immediately looked for the girl who was with him when he was found. He insisted to Lee Yi-taek that he must keep her by his side.</p>
<p>For some reason, Lee Yi-taek did not ignore Yoon-gun’s demands.</p>
<p>Only the father and son would know the detailed reasons.</p>
<p>Goyo had simply taken Lee Yi-taek’s outstretched hand. There was no other choice for a six-year-old girl who had lost her only family overnight. And she realized far too late that the sweet-looking stick of candy she had grasped was actually the handle to hell’s door.</p>
<p>Every time Yoon-gun tormented her, Goyo wondered:</p>
<p>Why did he want to bring her home? She had thought about it hundreds of times.</p>
<p>That day, Yoon-gun had shown her his weak and ugly self in all its rawness.</p>
<p>Was it because he wanted to isolate her, who had seen his shameful state? Or was his pride wounded by finding comfort in the embrace of a lowly girl?</p>
<p>The young boy, with bloodshot eyes and trembling hands, had begged to live with her, and Lee Yi-taek had no choice but to bring her home.</p>
<p>From the moment they arrived home, they began treating Goyo not as a human, but as a beast.</p>
<p>“I’ve been taking good care of her since then. But…”</p>
<p>He stopped thrusting and deeply furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>“She betrayed me and wagged her tail for another guy.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Ignored my calls and even stayed out!”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun raised his voice in irritation, grinding his teeth and exhaling roughly through his nostrils.</p>
<p>“Yoon-gun, are you seriously talking about… a dog?”</p>
<p>It was strange. He was talking about a dog, but it didn’t sound like a dog story at all. A proper human wouldn’t treat someone like a dog.</p>
<p>The woman looked at him with a puzzled expression, but Yoon-gun had no intention of explaining kindly.</p>
<p>“My dog… has finally come back.”</p>
<p>He had been planning to punish her even before she arrived at the hospital. Disciplining his pet when she disobeyed was his long-standing, nasty hobby.</p>
<p>The world was unaware of Goyo’s circumstances.</p>
<p>“…Go, Goyo, Lee Goyo. Lee Goyo!”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun called her name manically, turning his head toward her. Then he forcefully thrust his penis deeper into the woman’s wet opening.</p>
<p>“Ahk. Darling, who is that woman!”</p>
<p>The woman, following Yoon-gun’s gaze, spotted Goyo standing outside the room and let out a short scream.</p>
<p>“My dog.”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun muttered ominously, all traces of humor gone from his face.</p>
<p>The scene unfolding before her was deeply disturbing – a complex narrative of psychological manipulation, sexual violence, and profound human degradation.</p>
<p>Yoon-gun’s sudden, distorted facial expression and violent thrusting were terrifying.</p>
<p>The woman tried to push him away, twisting her body, but he gripped her buttocks and continued his brutal movements.</p>
<p>“You’re mine. Mine! Why does my dog keep looking elsewhere!”</p>
<p>Goyo had always been treated like a dog, but today seemed especially intense.</p>
<p>While Yoon-gun had previously made her watch or listen through doorways, he had never so brazenly displayed his sexual aggression.</p>
<p>“Come here. Lee Goyo, come here!”</p>
<p>He called her, exhaling breaths laden with pleasure. A pitch-black silence permeated the dark hospital room.</p>
<p>“…Damn, now you’re ignoring your master.”</p>
<p>The wet sounds of flesh continued, with the woman seemingly surrendering to his rhythm.</p>
<p>Goyo felt nauseated.</p>
