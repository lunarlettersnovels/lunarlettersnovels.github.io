            <p><strong>Chapter 4.1</strong></p>
<p><em>How should I take Yoon-gun out?</em></p>
<p>What should I do not to offend the man’s feelings in this situation? My mind was complicated, but no sharp solution came to mind. First, it seemed necessary to check Lee Yoon-gun’s pitiful condition.</p>
<p>Goyo gathered all her strength and moved to the living room. With each step, her blood felt like it was drying up.</p>
<p>As she approached, the man’s gaze turned to Goyo. With one eyebrow subtly raised, his gaze was chilling, making Goyo’s spine shiver.</p>
<p>Goyo stopped walking and gathered her courage.</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>Once their eyes met, she couldn’t say anything. Not a single excuse among the countless floating in my mind could come out of my throat.</p>
<p><em>Should I just kneel and beg?</em></p>
<p>No. The wrong was done by Lee Yoon-gun and that girl Min Jei, so it would seem strange for her to step forward and ask for forgiveness suddenly.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Don’t you have something to say?”</p>
<p>“I am Yoon-gun’s sister. I thought you’ve done enough and–.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“I’ll just stay quiet here until you calm down.”</p>
<p>Goyo cautiously spoke while scrutinizing the man’s expression. He was different from Lee Yoon-gun, whose mood was immediately evident on his face. Goyo couldn’t hastily judge what he might be thinking.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’ll wait until my anger subsides? How do you know when it will?”</p>
<p>The corners of the man’s lips curled slowly.</p>
<p>“How can it subside?” The man flashed Goyo a wide grin.</p>
<p>With just one smoothly drawn smile, the man’s demeanor seemed different. It was a captivating smile that could cleanse the chaos in one’s mind. In the midday sunshine, he seemed to shine brightly enough to dazzle.</p>
<p>Goyo was taken aback by the next words that came out of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Wanna suck my d*ck?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Goyo’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
<p>What did she just hear?</p>
<p>With a smirk, the man took a step closer to her. Goyo involuntarily took a step back, her mind racing.</p>
<p>Her chin, something caught on her ankle. Looking down, Goyo saw Lee Yoon-gun grabbing her ankle. It was he who had silently crawled over and grabbed her ankle.</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun’s bloodied face, eyes rolling back, resembled the demons she once saw in a temple.</p>
<p>“You, you…”</p>
<p>As Lee Yoon-gun’s lips trembled, a phone rang.</p>
<p>Ring-ring.</p>
<p>“Huh, the old man is impatient.”</p>
<p>The man reached into his pocket and pulled out a phone. After checking the screen, he frowned and muttered.</p>
<p>“It’s a nuisance… Should I just take it?”</p>
<p>With a grim expression, the man pressed the call button and went straight to the point without any formalities.</p>
<p>“I’m busy. Call back later.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Min Jei’s desperate scream echoed through the space.</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>As Min Jei protested, the menacing men who stood like screens advanced toward her ominously. The man gestured for them to wait and continued his call.</p>
<p>Through the receiver, what sounded like curses could be heard. The man removed the phone from his ear and raised his voice towards the microphone at the bottom.</p>
<p>“If you’re not pleased, come down here yourself. You’re better at stepping on ants than I am, aren’t you?” The man rubbed his temple and sighed, looking more tired than when dealing with Lee Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>“It’s a mistake! I lost my mind for a moment. Please forgive me!” Terrified, Min Jei crawled over, clinging to the man’s thigh with trembling knees.</p>
<p>“Did you hear? Miss Min Jei says it’s a mistake.”</p>
<p>The man looked down at the pale Min Jei and chuckled while talking to the person on the other end of the line. It was pathetic to see her lacking in courage despite her fierce display earlier, and it was pitiful to see her trying to repent now.</p>
<p>“Miss Min Jei seems to have nothing more to say. Cut it off, I’m busy.”</p>
<p>The man, who had been dryly continuing the call, suddenly furrowed his brow. It was because Min Jei, trembling, seemed to be attempting to flee.</p>
<p>At the man’s gesture, the men grabbed Min Jei’s arms.</p>
<p>“Why are you busy? Oh, that’s… because a pretty girl is going to suck your d*ck…”</p>
<p>The voice on the other end of the line instantly grew louder with the man’s words. It was so loud, almost too loud to comprehend.</p>
<p>–Wong wong- What are you doing… wong wong- I told you to catch her… nonsense… wong wong-*</p>
<p>“Damn it, am I your father? Deal with your b*tches yourself. I’m not going to waste time with Miss Min Jei.”</p>
<p>Another excited voice came through the phone speaker.</p>
<p>“I got it. I’ll wrap it nicely and deliver it to Seoul. You can handle Min Jei yourself.”</p>
<p>While still on the call, the man flicked his finger towards Min Jei. She, held by the men, begged tearfully.</p>
<p>“Mr. Kwon, plea-, please spare me. I, I… I don’t want to die.”</p>
<p>The words from the other end of the phone continued, but they were drowned out by Min Jei’s pleading. He pressed his index finger to his lips, signaling for silence.</p>
<p>Even as he urged her to be quiet, Min Jei shook her head and wailed. The man, wearing what seemed like a practiced smile, spoke with a chilling demeanor.</p>
<p>“Miss Min Jei, I’m on a call. Can’t talk with all this noise, can we? You’re old enough to know better, yet you caused this mess without foreseeing the consequences?”</p>
<p>The man’s smile grew wider. Though he appeared to be smiling, one eyebrow and the corner of his mouth were subtly raised, giving off an increasingly unsettling expression.</p>
<p>“Well, you shouldn’t have gotten caught, huh, mother?”</p>
