            <p><strong>Chapter 8.1</strong></p>
<p>“It seems like the lady is more interested in me than Executive Director Park.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon smirked as if he found Park Jung-hoon’s reaction amusing.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t assume that all women are interested in you.”</p>
<p>“Let’s ask Ms. Lee Goyo. Darling, you have something to say to me, right?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Goyo was at a loss for words at Kwon Jae-heon’s sudden question. She had followed him outside without thinking of anything specific to say.</p>
<p>“Jae-heon, do you know this woman? Her name is… Lee Goyo? Wait a minute. If she’s Lee Goyo, then she’s Assemblyman Lee Yi-taek’s… Ah, Kyuri’s cousin?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon mentioned his ex-wife’s name. He knew Goyo’s name but not her face.</p>
<p>“But Ms. Goyo, what exactly is your relationship with him?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>When asked what her relationship with Kwon Jae-heon was, Goyo couldn’t answer straightforwardly.</p>
<p>Their connection was unfortunate, caused by Lee Yun-geon’s womanizing, and there was no plausible way to explain it. It was better to say nothing at all.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>Jae-heon crossed his arms and quietly observed Goyo, who was clearly uncomfortable. As she hesitated and didn’t answer, a frown appeared on Jae-heon’s forehead.</p>
<p>What was so difficult about the question? Jae-heon himself had wondered about his relationship with Lee Goyo.</p>
<p>The favorite dog of the bastard who cheated on his father with his mistress?</p>
<p>The fake sister of Lee Yoon-gun who fooled around with Min Jei?</p>
<p>Their relationship was ambiguous and messy, making it difficult to explain accurately. Goyo’s reticence was understandable.</p>
<p>In a word…</p>
<p>“A complicated relationship.”</p>
<p>That about summed it up. Jae-heon pictured what he intended to do with Lee Goyo in his mind.</p>
<p>“Definitely complicated.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s vague words cast a chill over the surroundings, making everything fall silent.</p>
<p>“Jae-heon, do you know that woman?”</p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun had also noticed that Goyo’s gaze hadn’t left Kwon Jae-heon for a moment today.</p>
<p>It seemed Lee Yi-taek had no intention of hiding who he had chosen as today’s target. The doll’s gaze was openly following Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>Jae-heon had planned just to make a brief appearance at the banquet and then head straight to his room. Nothing else really interested him.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since he had been with a woman. Because of his father, who was so besotted with a young woman that he gave her everything, Jae-heon had developed an aversion to women for a while.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had been incredibly busy over the past month trying to recover a contract he had missed out on while dealing with Min Jei. He barely had time to sleep, let alone think about s*x.</p>
<p>He was so exhausted that he couldn’t tell if he wanted to have s*x or just sleep.</p>
<p>‘That woman is following us,’ Ji Seo-hyun whispered cautiously with a worried look. Perhaps it was a woman’s intuition. She seemed to have noticed that Jae-heon was conscious of Lee Goyo.</p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun was the type of woman who would follow him anywhere—banquet hall, auction house, hotel room—without complaint. She knew her place and acted accordingly, which he appreciated.</p>
<p>She was quick to adapt, did not complain when there was no contact, and behaved herself everywhere, making her easy to take along occasionally. She was a smart woman who knew what she could and couldn’t ask for.</p>
<p>In contrast, Lee Yi-taek’s doll was clearly a poisonous apple that would cause trouble if consumed.</p>
<p>‘Getting involved with a politician is not ideal.’</p>
<p>The last thing Jae-heon wanted was to get entangled with Lee Yi-taek just for a fling. He would rather be with Ji Seo-hyun, who came without complications.</p>
<p>As he inhaled the scent from her ample chest pressed against his arm, he felt a heaviness below. If he spent the night with Ji Seo-hyun, he was certain he would forget all about Lee Yi-taek’s doll.</p>
<p>He was about to leave without hesitation. But when he met her dry, unwavering gaze following him, he changed his mind.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, there’s something I need to collect.”</p>
<p>“From me?”</p>
<p>Suspicion flickered in her eyes.</p>
<p>Jae-heon loosened his lips into a smirk as he watched Goyo’s discomfiture. She was an enigma. It was clear she wanted him, yet her eyes were endlessly dry and devoid of any excitement or nervousness. It was as if she was a child being forced to eat vegetables she didn’t want.</p>
<p>“You said you would do it.”</p>
<p>“Do what?”</p>
<p>She blinked in confusion at his incomplete statement. There was no way she would remember. It was a thought he had only just recalled himself.</p>
<p>‘I think you’re still upset… What would it take to make you feel better…?’ Goyo remembered their bizarre conversation when they first met.</p>
<p>‘Want to suck my d!ck?’</p>
<p>It was a line he had thrown out in response to Goyo’s question about what would make him feel better. Of course, she had never actually promised to do it.</p>
<p>He thought he had completely forgotten. The existence of Lee Goyo, and the words they exchanged that day. Until he saw her again today.</p>
<p>“I want to collect today.”</p>
