            <p><strong>Chapter 11.1</strong></p>
<p>“Thank you for today.”</p>
<p>It was a kind of gamble. Would he let her go, or would he hold on to her?</p>
<p>“Lee Goyo, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Thud. He roughly placed the whiskey glass on the table. The sound of the ice clinking together sounded precarious.</p>
<p>Goyo knew well that her actions were reckless. They could easily be seen as bravado. However, she was doing her best to achieve the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>‘It can’t end with just a one-night stand.’</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek wanted her to have an ongoing relationship with Kwon Jae-heon. But if she went straight to bed now, it would surely end after one night. That’s why she had to struggle like this.</p>
<p>“It’s great that the person who gives amazing head and does what you want in bed didn’t leave. So go ahead and finish what you wanted to do with her.”</p>
<p>Goyo pretended to be naive, clapping her hands together and stretching her lips into a smile.</p>
<p>She tried to smile, but she wasn’t sure if she did it properly. Some of the words he had bluntly mentioned were too embarrassing for her to say out loud.</p>
<p>When Lee Yi-taek ordered her to seduce Kwon Jae-heon, she had thought it would be easy. But seeing Kwon Jae-heon coldly reject Ji Seo-hyun made her reconsider. If she simply stripped and had s*x with Kwon Jae-heon, it would end as just another one-night stand.</p>
<p>Even someone as skilled in bed as Ji Seo-hyun was easily dismissed, so it was obvious what would happen to someone as inexperienced as her. That’s why she attempted this desperate and seemingly reckless push-and-pull.</p>
<p>‘Will you reject me or keep me? You gave me this choice, so what will you choose?’</p>
<p>Goyo’s heart raced so fast she thought it might burst.</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>At Goyo’s sudden change in stance, Jae-heon let out a dry laugh.</p>
<p>“You can’t give a good head or have a tight p*ssy, so you’re just going to leave?”</p>
<p>He continued speaking, seemingly uninterested in her response.</p>
<p>“But what can I do?” His lips relaxed into a picturesque smile. “The choice is yours, not mine.”</p>
<p>Despite his gentle smile and kind voice, his eyes gleamed sharply as if mocking her.</p>
<p>‘Am I getting kicked out?’</p>
<p>Goyo clenched her fists tightly, trying not to show her anxiety. She couldn’t tell if her provocation had worked, and her heart pounded with uncertainty.</p>
<p>If she failed to prove her usefulness, she would face Lee Yi-taek’s wrath. He was a ruthless man who would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. He showed no mercy, not even to his own children.</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun was still in the hospital partly because Kwon Jae-heon had beaten him up but also because Lee Yi-taek had deemed him useless and struck him with a golf club as soon as he saw him.</p>
<p>A man who could brutally attack his own child wouldn’t spare Goyo either. If she failed in her task today, the fury that had once been directed at his son would be unleashed on her.</p>
<p>“I was quite kind to you.” Jae-heon sighed lightly over the whiskey glass on the table. Then he stood up and walked towards Goyo.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Goyo took a step back as Jae-heon approached her. But her attempt to retreat ended after just one step.</p>
<p>Her back hit the front door, and a dark shadow loomed over her. It was just a shadow, yet it felt as if her whole body was bound tightly with ropes.</p>
<p>“Yi-taek told you to do this, to seduce me.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon lowered his gaze and spoke in a languid tone.</p>
<p>Goyo instinctively realized that her clumsy attempt had been seen through. Trying to capture his interest with a few playful words was a futile effort from the start.</p>
<p>Taking a shallow breath, she parted her dry lips.</p>
<p>“If I seduce you, will you fall for it?”</p>
<p>“Why make a fuss over a one-night stand?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>There must have been numerous women he brought to hotels just like today. Just like how he had discarded Ji Seo-hyun. All he wanted was a woman to warm his bed tonight, whether it was Ji Seo-hyun or Lee Goyo, it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Just one night… I guess I thought too grandly.”</p>
