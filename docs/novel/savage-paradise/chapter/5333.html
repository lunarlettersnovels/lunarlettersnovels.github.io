        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 15.2</strong></p>
<p>Goyo’s mouth dropped open at the sight of the hideous mass of flesh that jutted out with a thud as soon as he pulled his briefs down. A hard, veined column of flesh peeked out from behind a swollen glans and nodded at him.</p>
<p>The mere thought of that thing penetrating beneath me sent a shiver down my spine.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t be surprised.”</p>
<p>Jaeheon ran his fingers down the thick, long shaft of flesh, then flicked his index finger across the glans, the thick shaft bouncing. Goyo’s mouth fell open at the sight of the clear glandular fluid oozing from the cracked glans.</p>
<p>Goyo shook her head in disbelief.</p>
<p>Jaeheon pulled Goyo’s hand down to his manhood. Earlier, it had been under his clothes, but now it was bare skin where he could feel its throbbing pulse.</p>
<p>The thick flesh was full in her grasp. She couldn’t even hold it in one hand.</p>
<p>As I gripped the stiff pillar carefully, precum began to ooze out drop by drop from the split tip of his manhood. Startled by this sight, Goyo tried to let go of it.</p>
<p>“You can’t do that.”</p>
<p>Jaeheon placed his palm over the back of her hand and applied gentle pressure. Her fingers curled around the shaft. She could feel the pulsating veins of the heated member.</p>
<p>“Move it. Up and down, like earlier.”</p>
<p>Jaeheon moved his hand along with Goyo’s, sliding up and down. The skin moved and stretched repeatedly within her grasp. The sensation of the twisting muscles beneath the thin skin was almost unnerving. Transparent fluid slowly oozed from the slit at the tip.</p>
<p>“Touch the top too.”</p>
<p>When she rubbed the split head with her fingertip, the sticky fluid stretched into long strings. Pressing the deeply indented urethral opening with her nail caused more precum to bead up and drip out. Jaeheon’s thigh trembled finely.</p>
<p>“Ah, ugh.”</p>
<p>As Jaeheon’s thigh moved, it stimulated Goyo’s private area. The mere sensation of gripping his was already overwhelming, but when her moist vulva rubbed against his firm thigh, her breath caught in her throat.</p>
<p>Her dripping arousal visibly soaked his expensive-looking pants.</p>
<p>“Haa, ugh…”</p>
<p>As Goyo struggled to escape his embrace, he tightened his thigh muscles, lifting her closer. His thigh, wedged between her spread legs, pressed against her vulva as if they were having intercourse. Goyo’s body trembled, and she gasped for breath.</p>
<p>“Now I understand why you don’t leave the entrance.”</p>
<p>Jaeheon lowered his gaze and exhaled deeply. He applied more pressure to the hand overlapping hers.</p>
<p>The sticky sensation in her grasp made Goyo’s whole body tingle, and a pull in her lower abdomen intensified. The mix of a sharp scent and his heavy body odor made her dizzy. The heat between her twitching thighs was unbearable.</p>
<p>Goyo’s eyelashes fluttered as she exhaled sharply.</p>
<p>“Please, please… ugh.”</p>
<p>“This is too stimulating. It feels like we won’t be able to stop all night.”</p>
<p>His breathing grew increasingly ragged.</p>
<p>“Ahh.” He gasped for breath, his breathing becoming erratic. Like a fuse igniting intensely, a fiery heat surged through him. As the stimulation built up, the entire shaft quivered as if a dam had burst in a flood.</p>
<p>In an instant, a whitish liquid burst from the tip and sprayed everywhere, even onto her face. Her hand, still gripping the flesh, was completely smeared with sticky white fluid.</p>
<p>“I think I might get addicted.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon, still excited, closed his eyes and breathed heavily. The humid breath he exhaled could be felt by Goyo.</p>
<p>“Sweetheart, this won’t do. If you want to get out of here, you need to choose.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon was already in a state of lost control, not caring at all about what she chose. Without waiting for Goyo’s answer, he grabbed her and headed for the bedroom.</p>
<p>“W-wait… this is… slow down… hold on, oh, oh, oh!”</p>
<p>Even when arresting a criminal, they wouldn’t drag them this urgently.</p>
<p>One of her shoes came off in the middle of the living room. As she turned to see where the other one had gone, there was a loud bang. Jae-heon had kicked the bedroom door open as he crossed the living room.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>As soon as they entered the bedroom, her body was lifted into the air. Before her scream had even finished, Goyo’s back hit the mattress.</p>
<p>“I can’t remember the last time I was this excited.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon climbed onto the bed and grabbed her thighs, spreading them apart.</p>
<p>“Even if I lose my mind and do something crazy, bear with it. It’s all your fault.”</p>
<p>With this not-quite warning, he buried his head between her spread legs.</p>
<p>His sharp nose brushed through the tuft of hair on the mound, and then his tongue parted the labia that covered her secret place. The soft yet rough sensation swirled below like lightning.</p>
<p>“What… what are you doing…!”</p>
<p>“Since you won’t suck my c*<em>ck, I’ll have to lick your pu</em>*<em>s</em>y.”</p>
