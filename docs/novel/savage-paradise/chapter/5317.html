            <p><strong>Chapter 24.2</strong></p>
<p>He whispered as she stared at the necklace. Only then did Goyo notice that alongside the whiskey, an elegant jewelry case sat on the bar table.</p>
<p>“The staff left it here.”</p>
<p>“…What? W-when?”</p>
<p>“Probably while we were f*cking.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>He meant the staff had come by while they were frantically coupling in the bedroom. They must have heard all their lewd sounds. Even if it was at a king-like customer’s request, they must have been embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Just your moans alone would make any cock stand at attention.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon lifted one of her legs onto his arm and thrust even harder. A high-pitched moan burst from Goyo’s lips.</p>
<p>“Ahh, ah… aahn.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that sound. f*ck, any man with a cock would go crazy.”</p>
<p>Their wet flesh made continuous squelching sounds as they rubbed together.</p>
<p>Goyo felt dizzy. Her neck felt heavy, and her heart ached.</p>
<p>Was this necklace the price for sharing her body?</p>
<p>So this was why Ji Seo-hyun had swallowed her pride and waited in the underground parking lot.</p>
<p>How foolish of her to misunderstand.</p>
<p>She had momentarily forgotten. That she had approached Kwon Jae-heon on her adoptive father’s orders. Even if Kwon Jae-heon treated her kindly, it didn’t change the fact that she was selling her body.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon hadn’t forgotten this fact. That’s why he reminded her of her position by giving her the necklace.</p>
<p>Telling her that she had sold herself to him.</p>
<p>“…Take, take it off.”</p>
<p>Goyo couldn’t find any beauty in the necklace around her neck. It looked like nothing more than proof that she was a high-class prostitute.</p>
<p>Yet she couldn’t bring herself to blame Kwon Jae-heon. It was just her own inferiority complex.</p>
<p>“You don’t like it?”</p>
<p>Clank- clank-. The necklace swayed with their out-of-sync movements as they faced each other. The jewel sparkled alone in the darkness.</p>
<p>“It’s, it’s not mi- ah, ah… haah.”</p>
<p>“It is yours.”</p>
<p>His eyes sparkled like jewels as he looked down at her.</p>
<p>“Ahh, ah… no. Aah!”</p>
<p>If Ji Seo-hyun had entered the bedroom instead of her, she would have been the owner of the jewel. It wasn’t originally meant for her. Neither the necklace nor Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“A gift from oppa to you.”</p>
<p>“Aah, hnngh, such an exp- expensive… ah, no… aah!”</p>
<p>She was naked now. The only thing on her body was the necklace Kwon Jae-heon had won for 1 billion won. Putting such an expensive necklace on a naked woman.</p>
<p>Was this his sexual preference?</p>
<p>Goyo never imagined he would use the necklace he won at auction this way. She wondered if seeing a woman wearing an expensive necklace excited him more.</p>
<p>“If you don’t like it, throw it away.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s thick flesh entered deep inside her once more with a thud.</p>
<p>Let me rephrase with more appropriate language:</p>
<p>“It’s nothing special to me.”</p>
<p>At Jae-heon’s words about it being nothing special, Goyo felt rather disappointed.</p>
<p>Human hearts were fickle. If he had imbued it with meaning, saying it was a gift because he liked her, she might have felt less pitiful about her situation.</p>
<p>Her body swayed with his movements. With each motion, the swinging necklace kept striking her heart.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>It was a time when it was hard to tell if it was late night or early dawn.</p>
<p>Goyo, who had entered the hotel room on Friday evening, could only eat the dinner – or rather late-night meal – that Kwon Jae-heon had ordered when it was nearly midnight. Even that was only possible after their intimate encounter.</p>
<p>After eating, they returned to the bedroom. Their intimacy continued, and they only fell asleep, almost unconscious, after dawn broke.</p>
<p>His warning about not being able to control himself due to it being a while wasn’t a joke at all. She had thought it ridiculous that a man who never lacked female attention couldn’t have been intimate for long, but it wasn’t a lie.</p>
<p>They were together again immediately after waking up. More precisely, she woke up to his advances. He showed no signs of tiring.</p>
<p>When it seemed to end, it would start again, and just when she thought it was really over, it would begin again. Eventually, she just gave up.</p>
<p>‘At least he feeds me.’</p>
<p>Their cycle of intimacy and meals continued until Saturday evening’s twilight, when they fell asleep almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>How long had she slept? Goyo, awakening to an inexplicable anxiety, turned her head to look beside her.</p>
<p>She caught sight of the sharp jawline of the man who had exhausted her. Jae-heon was in deep sleep, apparently tired. Well, any human would be exhausted.</p>
<p>“…Beast.”</p>
<p>When he called himself a bastard, even that had been true.</p>
