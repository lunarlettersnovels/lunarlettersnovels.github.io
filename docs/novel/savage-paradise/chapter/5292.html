            <p><strong>Chapter 37.2</strong></p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon knew that Executive Director Park Jung-hoon meeting Lee Goyo had been orchestrated by Lee Yi-taek. But until Lee Goyo was completely his, he had no choice but to go along with the act.</p>
<p>Bzzz— Bzzz—</p>
<p>What impeccable timing. Just then, her phone rang, cutting off their conversation.</p>
<p>Lee Goyo quickly checked the screen. The caller was Lee Yoon-gun. As she stared blankly at the display, the call ended. Almost immediately, another call came through. Lee Goyo simply pressed the reject button.</p>
<p>A message arrived right after.</p>
<p>Lately, this same situation had been repeating itself.</p>
<p>Bzzz—</p>
<p>Lee Goyo sighed, shaking her head. She could already guess what the message said. But when she glanced at the screen, the content far exceeded her expectations.</p>
<p><strong>[It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts]</strong></p>
<p>Bzzz—</p>
<p><strong>[Where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you where are you]</strong></p>
<p>Bzzz—</p>
<p><strong>[Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo]</strong></p>
<p>“He’s lost it.”</p>
<p>The madness of Lee Yoon-gun filled the entire screen. The messages, eerie like something from a deranged lunatic, made it hard for her to breathe.</p>
<p>“Lee Yoon-gun… if he’s not insane…”</p>
<p>Her hand, gripping the phone, trembled.</p>
<p>He must have hit his head when Kwon Jae-heon punched him. He had never been normal to begin with, but this—this was something else. He had spent his life believing that the only person who could control him was his father. Then he met a man even stronger than himself, one who had humiliated him completely. And now, it seemed, he had finally snapped.</p>
<p><strong>“What did that little punk send you this time?”</strong></p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon snatched her phone. He quickly scrolled through the screen, checking the messages Lee Yoon-gun had sent.</p>
<p>“Oh, this is something else…”</p>
<p>Jae-heon let out a short, incredulous laugh.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while since I’ve seen an idiot who still doesn’t get it even after a beating.”</p>
<p>“D-don’t look at it!”</p>
<p>Goyo gasped for breath, her face turning pale.</p>
<p>“Brothers usually don’t care much about their sisters. Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>“…Th-that’s…”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s because you’re not actually related?”</p>
<p>At Jae-heon’s words, Goyo bit her lip hard. There was no doubt that this was something a real brother would never do—completely unnatural behavior.</p>
<p>What kind of brother becomes obsessed with his sister like that? The only reason this twisted situation was even possible was because their relationship wasn’t real.</p>
<p>“He should either treat you like a person or stop acting like this altogether. I wonder what he’s really after.”</p>
<p>The longer Jae-heon spoke, the more shame Goyo felt.</p>
<p>If Yoon-gun’s feelings were at least a normal kind of affection, she wouldn’t feel so humiliated. But his actions didn’t even make sense. He treated her like nothing, yet still clung to her. How was she supposed to understand this warped sense of possession?</p>
<p>“Well, I guess he still doesn’t get it because you keep putting up with him.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon frowned as he stared at the screen, filled with her name repeated over and over.</p>
<p>“Maybe I should have broken both his hands.”</p>
<p>Since his hand was injured, it seemed like he had just copy-pasted the same word repeatedly. Jae-heon should have broken all ten fingers so he wouldn’t even be able to send this pathetic excuse of a message.</p>
<p>“I keep making mistakes—how unlike me.”</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, Jae-heon’s fingers moved over the screen.</p>
<p>“I blocked him.”</p>
<p>He said it with complete indifference.</p>
<p>“And while I was at it, I sent him a message too.”</p>
<p>“W-what? What did you send?”</p>
<p>Goyo gasped, startled, and reached out for the phone.</p>
<p>In response, Jae-heon casually dropped it to the ground.</p>
<p>Then, with a sharp crack, he crushed it under his heel.</p>
<p>As if the phone were Yoon-gun himself, he stomped on it, again and again.</p>
<p>Crack. Thud. Thud. A few merciless kicks, and the phone was shattered into pieces.</p>
