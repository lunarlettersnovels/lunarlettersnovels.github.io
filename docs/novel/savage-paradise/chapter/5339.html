            <p><strong>Chapter 12.2</strong></p>
<p>Jae-heon wrinkled his brow at the metallic taste of blood. With their lips pressed together, every word he uttered reverberated with a tremor. Goyo, startled, opened her eyes and attempted to justify herself with a flustered expression.</p>
<p>“I… I told you I’m not good at this.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you’d be this bad.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon smirked. “Yoon-gun let this slide easily.”</p>
<p>She lived under the same roof with a perverted lunatic like Yoon-gun, who has an active s*x life like a rabbit. Even if they grew up like siblings, legally, they shouldn’t be involved.</p>
<p>“Did I just snatch away the last treat he saved to devour?”</p>
<p>“No wonder he is going crazy.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon listened to his phone’s persistent vibration with an enigmatic expression. He couldn’t resist his desires, causing an accident and ultimately losing the prized possession. In the end, he fell victim to Yi-taek’s schemes.</p>
<p>“It might be fun to teach you a lesson.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s eyes glimmered with rising satisfaction.</p>
<p>In this war, he had suffered no losses. On the contrary, he had gained plenty.</p>
<p>Thanks to Yoon-gun, he had easily gotten rid of his father’s annoying mistress, Min Jei, and exploited Lee Yi Taek’s weaknesses. Moreover, he even acquired Yoon-gun’s beloved pet. It was a victorious feeling, having won the war without shedding a drop of blood.</p>
<p>Above all, Jae-heon quite liked the spoils nestled in his arms.</p>
<p>“It’s okay if you can’t; I’ll take care of it, baby.”</p>
<p>He was a man true to his instincts.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jae-heon”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to call you President’ even during the act?”</p>
<p>“Since it’s just for one night, does the title really matter?”</p>
<p>“It should be done properly, even if it’s just for one night.”</p>
<p>He subtly lifted the corners of his mouth, offering a smirk to Goyo. That smile was neither warm nor kind. It was simply perceived as a form of coercion, pressuring her.</p>
<p>Goyo tried out the unfamiliar term in her mouth. “…Oppa.”</p>
<p>Oppa. Why were men so fixated on that title?</p>
<p>Calling Yoon-gun “oppa” also made her shudder with distaste. But if she didn’t use that term, she faced consequences. The title “oppa” felt like humiliation or submission to her. It was a term she reluctantly used, feeling it didn’t suit her at all. She had never found any pleasure in it.</p>
<p>“Oh… That title seems a bit dangerous.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon murmured as he stroked her neck. It was a gentle touch, yet it also felt like he could strangle her at any moment.</p>
<p>“What… What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Ha, Yi-taek… He is really something. Politicians’ tricks have always made Jae-heon sick, but the bait Yi-taek threw was quite tempting.</p>
<p>When Jae-heon extended his hand, there were plenty of beauties ready to jump into bed with him. He was no longer in his twenties, and the meaningless flirtations were becoming tiresome.</p>
<p>Moreover, there’s nothing good about getting involved with politicians. They’re like migratory birds risking their lives for power that changes every four or five years.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all that, I want this woman…</p>
<p>His rational concerns were overshadowed by the fleshly mass hanging beneath him, which seemed ready to burst.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter.” Jae-heon chuckled incredulously.</p>
<p>“You are an expensive and dangerous auction item, but I am willing to risk it.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Goyo couldn’t refute Jae-heon’s mocking remark about her being an auction item.</p>
<p>It fits her current situation perfectly. Yi-taek will sell herself to the highest bidder, so there’s no difference from being an auction item.</p>
<p>“Then why do I feel dirty?” Jae-heon narrowed his eyes and frowned.</p>
<p>Her words, “Tonight,” grated on his ears. It sounded like she would ride another bastard after tonight.</p>
