            <p><strong>Chapter 25.1</strong></p>
<p>How could someone engage in intimacy non-stop?</p>
<p>When she muttered to herself, he stirred slightly. Goyo held her breath and closed her mouth. She feared he might wake up and overwhelm her again.</p>
<p>Goyo carefully rose from the bed. The moment her feet touched the floor, an involuntary moan escaped her. Her nipples, ravaged by Jae-heon, were swollen bright red, and the area around her intimate parts was sore from his constant intrusion.</p>
<p>She tiptoed out of the bedroom and turned on the phone Jae-heon had tossed on the home bar.</p>
<p>25th, 11 PM.</p>
<p>She had entered the hotel around 9 PM on Friday the 24th, meaning she had endured Kwon Jae-heon for twenty-six hours. Though she had taken brief moments of rest feigning exhaustion, they had essentially been intimate almost continuously.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>No wonder her body was completely wrecked.</p>
<p>Ding- ding- ding-.</p>
<p>The moment she turned on the power, notifications began flooding in. Lee Yoon-gun had been leaving messages frantically and continued to do so.</p>
<p>[Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo Lee Goyo How dare you ignore me!!!!!!]</p>
<p>“…Whew.”</p>
<p>This was the first time Goyo’s phone had been off for nearly twenty-four hours. That’s why the madman had gone even crazier.</p>
<p>[I’ve sent a car. Driver Kim will wait until you come down.]</p>
<p>[You didn’t want to do that, right? Say that.]</p>
<p>[I got a bit excited. I was angry because you didn’t listen to me. Come today, and I’ll forgive you.]</p>
<p>“Forgiveness? What did I do wrong?”</p>
<p>‘I am here because of someone else. My adoptive father sells me to men, and his son goes crazy about me being with a man.’</p>
<p>‘What do they want me to do?’</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>Goyo was sick of being leashed by Lee Yi-taek and Lee Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>Her biological father, Lee Chul-woo.</p>
<p>He was a vicious criminal who kidnapped children for organ trafficking.</p>
<p>When he died during the children’s rescue operation, criticism initially targeted the police’s excessive suppression. But when the prosecution detailed the circumstances, no one sympathized with his death.</p>
<p>At the time, Lee Yoon-gun was bloody and unconscious during the rescue. Though he underwent emergency surgery, missing the optimal surgical window left him with a permanently uncomfortable leg.</p>
<p>‘Goyo, you can never predict how Yoon-gun might change if he learns the secret of your birth. You just need to listen to me. Do exactly as I say without thinking.’</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek constantly brainwashed Goyo.</p>
<p>He etched into her ears, her mind, her heart that Yoon-gun’s condition was her fault. He emphasized hundreds, thousands of times that she should prostrate herself before her brother as atonement. Believing this was how she would be forgiven for her biological father’s sins, Goyo endured shamefully degrading days, treated less than human.</p>
<p>‘Damn, I should have killed that bastard!’</p>
<p>Every time Lee Yoon-gun went for rehabilitation, he said the kidnapper’s death was what infuriated him most. He ground his teeth, saying he should make someone suffer exactly as he did. He didn’t hesitate to say he should have torn him apart with his own hands.</p>
<p>Would Yoon-gun realize he’s actually getting his revenge now?</p>
<p>By slowly killing the kidnapper’s own daughter, Lee Goyo. Just like this.</p>
<p>Buzz buzz.</p>
<p>The phone’s battery was close to zero. Seeing the red battery warning, she thought both Yoon-gun’s patience and her own life were nearly depleted.</p>
<p>“…I should go.”</p>
<p>If she stayed out again, she couldn’t predict what he might do.</p>
<p>Driver Kim is waiting, so the car Yoon-gun sent should be in the underground parking lot. If they can’t take her, the driver would certainly bear the full brunt of his anger.</p>
<p>No matter the power dynamic, being cursed and beaten by someone young enough to be his son would be an unforgettable wound.</p>
<p>He might even get fired. She remembered he said his second daughter would start elementary school next year.</p>
<p>She would rather bear Yoon-gun’s anger herself. She couldn’t watch a family’s breadwinner be destroyed because of her.</p>
<p>“Whether today or tomorrow…”</p>
<p>Nothing would change.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon and her weren’t even in a relationship where she could choose not to see him.</p>
<p>Unless she completely broke free from Lee Yi-taek, she couldn’t avoid Lee Yoon-gun. Provoking him would only make things worse for her.</p>
<p>As Goyo packed her bag, her gaze fell on the jewelry case on the home bar.</p>
<p>Inside the case, which was open wide, a certificate was inserted into a holder made of top-grade leather. The packaging was luxurious, as if to prove its expensive price.</p>
<p>Goyo stared at the case for a moment, then removed the necklace from her neck. She casually tossed it into the case and turned away.</p>
<p>She was somewhat concerned about Kwon Jae-heon sleeping in the bedroom, but a one-night encounter was just that.</p>
<p>Goyo was more worried about Lee Yoon-gun, whom she had to see every day, than Kwon Jae-heon, whom she could simply ignore.</p>
