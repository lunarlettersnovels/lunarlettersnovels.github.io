            <p><strong>Chapter 1.2</strong></p>
<p>With every thrust of his hips, the hot, hard flesh penetrated her deeply.</p>
<p>“If you want me to stop, then don’t squeeze so tightly.”</p>
<p>It was by the roadside in front of a high-rise residential-commercial building. The heavy rain and the dark tinted windows provided some cover, but there was still a chance that someone outside could see in. The possibility of being seen heightened the s*xual tension.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ah, aah.”</p>
<p>As he thrust deep into her slick, loosened inner walls, Koyo moaned and involuntarily arched her body. Instinctively, she spread her legs as wide as possible, allowing his slick, lubricant-coated manho0d to glide in and out of her easily.</p>
<p>Each time his fully erect flesh plunged deeply into her belly, her reddish inner flesh was drawn out along with it, moving back and forth and wrapping around his with sticky fluid. Her fluids also trickled out of her opening, twitching slightly.</p>
<p>“Haa, ah, ahh, …ugh!”</p>
<p>The ticking sound of the hazard lights rhythmically contrasted with the sound of their bodies slapping together, adding a l*wd soundtrack to their actions. The flashing red lights, momentarily coloring the world in shades of crimson before disappearing, added to the erot!c atmosphere.</p>
<p>He seemed to be reaching his c!imax, breathing heavily as he thrust deeply.</p>
<p>—Breaking news. Unseasonal winter downpour… record rainfall for January…</p>
<p>Goyo thought that their relationship was like this unexpected winter storm, an anomaly.</p>
<p>From their first meeting, nothing had been normal. The subsequent encounters were no different.</p>
<p>“Are you going to do it again?”</p>
<p>She felt him stiffening and swelling once more. After all, he had never finished with just one round.</p>
<p>“So, do you not want it?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon grabbed his and began to tease her entrance with the thick head, brushing and tapping against it. He smeared her cl!toris with the slick head, rubbing against it. Her still-open entrance seemed to want to swallow him whole.</p>
<p>“If you want, we can stop.”</p>
<p>He asked in a deepened, husky voice.</p>
<p>He asks for her consent, knowing she won’t refuse. The scent emanating from him and the musky smell filling the car were too overwhelming for her to think clearly.</p>
<p>The sweet, sultry scent of their lovemaking made her head swim. She was intoxicated by the scent and addicted to the act, making it impossible to refuse.</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>Addiction is generally classified into substance addiction and behavioral addiction.</p>
<p>Since meeting Kwon Jae-heon, Lee Goyo had fallen into relationship addiction due to her excessive dependence on s*x.</p>
<p>“Put it in.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your… c*ck.”</p>
<p>At her words, his glistening manho0d slid into her entrance. Her trembling entrance convulsed as it swallowed his flesh.</p>
<p>“Stir me up.”</p>
<p>So that no other thoughts can enter…</p>
<p>He started thrusting, and simultaneously, their lips pressed together. Their tongues intertwined.</p>
<p>There was never any love in this relationship from the start.</p>
<p>Mixing bodies like mindless beasts, they poured out resentment, longing, regret, hope, and despair. They expressed the emotions they couldn’t voice through this act.</p>
<p>During these moments, he became entirely hers.</p>
<p>“Ah, ugh, ah…!”</p>
<p>Her connection with Kwon Jae-heon dated back two months.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Two months ago,</p>
<p>One day in November.</p>
<p>It was a cloudless, clear day.</p>
<p>The heavenly Cheondo (天島) Han Young Resort famous for its scenic golf course overlooking the sea.</p>
<p>As a world-class resort, the room interiors were luxurious. Smooth marble floors, elegant luxury furniture, and art pieces were placed throughout. The expansive terrace garden and the picturesque scenery of the southern coast visible through the floor-to-ceiling windows made it seem exotic enough to be mistaken for a foreign country.</p>
<p>In November, unexpectedly warm sunlight shone through the large glass windows, gently enveloping her face.</p>
<p>It would have definitely been a romantic afternoon if Goyo hadn’t witnessed the harsh kicks and indiscriminate violence of the men in black suits.</p>
<p><strong>Hello everyone! We bring you another new novel. Hope you enjoy it!</strong></p>
