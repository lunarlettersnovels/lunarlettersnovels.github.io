            <p><strong>Chapter 55.2</strong></p>
<p>“You never even got married yourself—so why are you pressuring me to?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon sneered at Kwon Moo-young, who was trying to force marriage on him after never marrying himself.</p>
<p>“Do you think we’re the same? I didn’t get married because I was too busy trying to survive. And kids—back in my day, there was a birth control policy! If you had too many, you’d be dirt poor. Even two was considered too many. ‘Just one child’—so I only left one!”</p>
<p>Jae-heon let out a bitter chuckle at his father’s words.</p>
<p>“Left only one, huh.”</p>
<p>In the end, it wasn’t wrong—of Kwon Moo-young’s bloodline, only Kwon Jae-heon had survived.</p>
<p>“A father in his old age just wants to enjoy the company of a grandchild, but his own son can’t even give him that. Tsk.”</p>
<p>“Father, Mr. Ahn is about to pass out. Unless you’re going to eat the noodles like udon, please just go.”</p>
<p>“Ugh. This is why sons are no good. A granddaughter would be better. I don’t care who—just bring me one. A girl.”</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young muttered dispassionately.</p>
<p>‘Does he not know Jae-heon had a vasectomy? He’ll never have a grandchild.’</p>
<p>Looking at Kwon Moo-young, Goyo wore a bitter expression. Ever since Kwon Moo-young started talking about Jae-heon getting married, Goyo had felt suffocated.</p>
<p>Even with his son’s woman standing right next to him, Kwon Moo-young casually talked about finding someone for Jae-heon to marry. From the way things were going, Goyo quickly realized her place—she was the “anyone” he mentioned.</p>
<p>The chairman’s words sounded like a clear warning not to even think about marrying Jae-heon, even if she got pregnant and had his child.</p>
<p>Just do your job as Jae-heon’s s<em>men receptacle. You’re nothing more than an accessory. Don’t get greedy, you’re just a s</em>x partner.</p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun’s expression also hardened. She was glamorous and beautiful enough to keep around, but that was it. Kwon Moo-young never introduced her to anyone. From that, Goyo could tell—Ji Seo-hyun was just another accessory.</p>
<p>“Son, do your best and make me a granddaughter tonight, okay? Daddy’s rooting for you!”</p>
<p>“Enough already.”</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young, shoved along by Kwon Jae-heon, reluctantly began making his way toward the banquet hall exit. Moving so slowly he could’ve been invited to befriend a sloth, he took his time shaking hands, offering blessings, and making sure every guest saw him off.</p>
<p>As if that wasn’t enough, he only left after getting Jae-heon’s word that they’d have breakfast together the next morning. A distance that would take less than a minute at a brisk pace took him over thirty minutes to cross.</p>
<p>“Is it really okay to let the elder go like that?”</p>
<p>asked Kim Hyun-woo, Jae-heon’s chief aide, with concern.</p>
<p>“He’ll manage.”</p>
<p>Exhausted to his limit, Jae-heon irritably ran his fingers through his hair.</p>
<p>“If he goes with Ji Seo-hyun, things could get noisy.”</p>
<p>“The old man’s always been like this. It’s nothing new.”</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young left in grand fashion, Ji Seo-hyun tucked at his side. They looked ready to head straight to the Blue House together.</p>
<p>“Should we keep an eye on the media outlets?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for us to act. Mr. Ahn will handle it well enough.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon pressed at his temple firmly. Dealing with his father always gave him headaches that didn’t exist before.</p>
<p>If his father attended a presidential banquet with Ji Seo-hyun, rumors would spread—but that wasn’t Jae-heon’s problem. Ji Seo-hyun would just be added to the long list of his father’s women, and she had her own motives for staying close, so there was no reason for Jae-heon to intervene.</p>
<p>Ahn would take care of it. By tomorrow, not a single media outlet would print a word about Kwon Moo-young.</p>
<p>“More importantly, I need to find the mole. When the hell did he plant them?”</p>
<p>He’d met Lee Ui-taek earlier that day. He hadn’t been secretive about it, so he hadn’t taken any extra precautions. He’d expected his father would find out eventually—but to storm in and confront him by evening?</p>
<p>It meant his father had planted a spy—someone who served as his eyes and ears. Jae-heon had thought he’d cleared out all his father’s people, but clearly, he still had work to do.</p>
<p>“We did hire new staff this year. Maybe one of them slipped in then.”</p>
<p>“I suspect someone from the existing staff.”</p>
<p>If they investigated those who were in debt and struggling to make ends meet, or those needing money for their children’s tuition or overseas education, they’d find the answer.</p>
<p>“I’ll look into it.”</p>
<p>“Make sure to root them out completely.”</p>
<p>Being under his father’s thumb was exhausting. It was time to turn things over for good.</p>
<p>More importantly… where did she go?</p>
<p>Lee Goyo was gone.</p>
<p>He’d only looked away for a moment, and she had vanished from right in front of him.</p>
