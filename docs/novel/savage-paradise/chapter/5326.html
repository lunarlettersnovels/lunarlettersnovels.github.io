            <p><strong>Chapter 20.1</strong></p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“P-please, put it in…”</p>
<p>“Hold your legs steady and lift your hips. That way, it will go in properly.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon guided Goyo’s hand beneath her belly.</p>
<p>Goyo embraced her belly with both hands to keep herself from collapsing. She raised her hips high, fearing any mishap if she lost her strength.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Jae-heon’s lips curled into a smile. He brushed his hair back, ready to proceed with determination.</p>
<p>Gripping her pelvis firmly, Jae-heon began to thrust into her with force.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Thud, thud, thud! The solid column moved within, stirring the Goyo’s sensitive inner walls.</p>
<p>“Ah… ha, ha, ha.”</p>
<p>Her breath came in gasps from deep within her chest. Unfamiliar muscles cried out, and her insides, experiencing this for the first time, were in disarray.</p>
<p>Each movement, pushing through the moist warmth and pulling out, sent flashes through her vision. As her hips moved, soft, familiar sounds echoed, her body trembling as if touched by electricity.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ah, ugh, ah!”</p>
<p>She was pressed down and moved forcefully, feeling overwhelmed by the imposing presence behind her. The sensation of him adjusting his angle sent shivers through her body.</p>
<p>What she thought was extreme pain soon transformed into intense pleasure, surging through her entire being. Lightning seemed to flash before her eyes, and her mind went blank.</p>
<p>“It’s your first time.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon muttered, detecting the metallic scent of blood.</p>
<p>Red streaks mixed with her fluids stained his shaft. Although he had suspected it, seeing the blood confirmed it, evoking a strange feeling.</p>
<p>While many men might prefer a virgin, Jae-heon had never been one to obsess over his partner’s purity. He actually preferred experienced partners, as clumsy actions could ruin the enjoyment.</p>
<p>Usually, he would have dismissed her, finding no fun in inexperience, but this time was different.</p>
<p>Jae-heon held her trembling body tightly and continued his relentless movements. Goyo struggled to breathe, gasping for air.</p>
<p>“That’s why I asked you to be gentle and… ah.”</p>
<p>Her tearful plea echoed in his ears.</p>
<p>“I thought I was being gentle enough.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon felt like a cruel adult, an unfeeling beast.</p>
<p>Well, considering the age difference, he might as well be a thief.</p>
<p>“…Feeling guilty.”</p>
<p>An unfamiliar emotion, never experienced while being with a woman, stirred within Jae-heon.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>Their encounter, which began early in the evening, lasted until late at night. To be precise, it didn’t stop voluntarily; it was Goyo’s inability to continue, passing out from exhaustion, that forced the cessation.</p>
<p>“…Should I be grateful?”</p>
<p>How many are there?</p>
<p>The trash bin filled with used condoms was evidence enough; there were quite a few.</p>
<p>Jae-heon stepped out for a smoke, and during his absence, Goyo emerged from the bedroom. Having left her clothes in the living room, she wrapped herself in a sheet and made her way there, though each step threatened to buckle her weakened legs.</p>
<p>‘Didn’t I leave my clothes by the entrance?’</p>
<p>As soon as she opened the bedroom door, she turned toward the entrance.</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>Her mouth fell open. The first thing she noticed was a lone shoe with its sole facing up, right outside the bedroom door.</p>
<p>‘Why is this here?’</p>
<p>Goyo glanced around for the other shoe.</p>
<p>“…Ah!”</p>
<p>A helpless exclamation escaped her lips. She spotted the other shoe beneath a pair of shredded stockings. Nearby lay her panties and bra, scattered on the floor. By the entrance, her dress lay inside out, next to her bag.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>She let out a mirthless laugh. The stained wall near the entrance vividly reminded her of the intense encounter from a few hours ago.</p>
<p>‘Move it like you did earlier, up and down.’</p>
<p>Traces of her hands gripping him firmly were still fresh in her mind.</p>
<p>A wave of heat flushed Goyo’s face.</p>
<p>Goyo shook her head, trying to dispel the vivid memories playing in her mind. Though she might recall these moments every time she entered the hallway, the consolation was that she wouldn’t have to return here. Fortunately…</p>
<p>Fortunately? Was it really a good thing that she wouldn’t be coming back?</p>
