        <div class="reader-text">
            
            <p><strong>Chapter 60.2</strong></p>
<p>Gyo’s social circle was narrow, so she had no friends to watch movies with. Even going as a group from school was something Lee Yi-taek wouldn’t allow. Besides, she didn’t want to go watch a movie with either Lee Yi-taek or Lee Yoon-geon. Just the thought of it was dreadful.</p>
<p>Since she never really enjoyed movies, there was no genre she particularly liked.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it… there was a movie I enjoyed.”</p>
<p>A fragment of a memory surfaced at the edge of Goyo’s mind. She recalled going to the theater with her dad a long time ago.</p>
<p>“What kind?”</p>
<p>“Uh, a cartoon?”</p>
<p>She suddenly thought of a scene where a princess in a dress was singing and dancing. It was a typical children’s animation that ended with the prince rescuing the princess who was kidnapped by a villain.</p>
<p>“A cartoon? You mean an animation?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>While watching the movie, she had told her dad she would marry a prince someday. In reality, there were nothing but crazy people all around, let alone a prince.</p>
<p>“Heh, a cartoon, huh? No wonder you’re still a kid.”</p>
<p>Jaeheon furrowed his brows and tapped her chin lightly with his finger. Goyo looked at him quietly.</p>
<p>She had thought that if she ever came to the theater, it would be with a boyfriend… That thought made her heart flutter for no good reason.</p>
<p>Just as a ticklish warmth rose around her ears, thankfully, the theater lights went out.</p>
<p>The movie they came to see was “The Savior,” which had been a hot topic since its production. It was also the movie mentioned in a newspaper article Lee Yi-taek had read when he visited her in the hospital.</p>
<p>“On New Year’s Day, the anticipated movie is ‘The Savior.’ Genius pianist Cha Kang-hyun. His long, beautiful fingers quickly turn into murder weapons, and all the invited audience end up as corpses… Tsk tsk. The world’s gone mad. A movie glamorizing a psychopathic murderer is the number one pre-sale hit?”</p>
<p>At the time, Goyo thought Lee Yi-taek was just reading some random eye-catching articles out of habit. It was a bit surprising since his usual interests lay in social and economic sections, not art or movies. That day, he happened to be reading an article about art.</p>
<p>Did Lee Yi-taek know, too? That “The Savior” was a movie invested in by Kwon Jaeheon? Maybe that’s why he seemed more uneasy than usual.</p>
<p>How could Goyo possibly know Lee Yi-taek’s true feelings? She let out a quiet sigh and focused on the screen.</p>
<p>The movie began with the male lead’s monologue.</p>
<p>— “You may call me a cold-hearted murderer, but I am your savior.”</p>
<p>―It’s your fault they died.</p>
<p>―You should look at me, just focus on me. You only need me.</p>
<p>―You’re mine, you belong to me!</p>
<p>As the movie progressed, Goyo’s expression grew increasingly tense. With each line spoken by the murderer, memories of Lee Yoon-geon’s cruel words echoed in her mind, causing the hairs on her body to stand on end.</p>
<p>Was this feeling of déjà vu because of that man?</p>
<p>‘It’s your fault he got hurt. Even if he dies, it’s your fault.’</p>
<p>‘Look at me. Just look at me. Goyo, now you have no one but me.’</p>
<p>‘Goyo, you’re mine. You belong to me, mine!’</p>
<p>“Crazy people all sound the same.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon seemed to have similar thoughts, chuckling softly as he muttered. Goyo couldn’t bring herself to laugh. It didn’t seem like something someone who had put that madman in the hospital twice should say.</p>
<p>In fact, Goyo felt that both Lee Yoon-geon and Kwon Jae-heon were equally binding her.</p>
<p>A madman and an even madder man.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a significant difference between the two.</p>
<p>“Hey, that expression isn’t good. I didn’t kill like that. If that guy had been in charge, Lee Yoon-geon would be lying in a coffin, not a hospital bed.”</p>
<p>“……I didn’t say anything.”</p>
<p>“Your expression said it all.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon said with a nonchalant expression.</p>
<p>“If you’re moved by this movie and change your mind, let me know. But the way they do it there is a no-go for me. I have a weak stomach and prefer things clean.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Who has a weak stomach?</p>
<p>Goyo recalled the first time she saw Kwon Jae-heon. He had been looking down at Lee Yoon-geon, writhing in a pool of blood, with an indifferent expression.</p>
<p>Seeing Goyo’s incredulous look, Jae-heon simply shrugged.</p>
<p>“If you point it out, I’ll make sure anyone behind the screen gets a whiff of the scent.”</p>
<p>“What kind of joke is that? It’s not funny.”</p>
<p>Goyo shuddered.</p>
<p>“Not funny?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon closed his mouth and turned his gaze back to the screen.</p>
