            <p><strong>Chapter 43.2</strong></p>
<p>Silence’s lips parted and a masturbatory moan escaped.</p>
<p>Their bodies moved together, heat spreading between them. Jae-heon’s voice was low, teasing.</p>
<p>“See? I told you it would feel good.”</p>
<p>Goyo clung to him, her fingers pressing against his back, feeling the solid warmth of him.</p>
<p>His movements were deep and deliberate, each motion sending a wave of sensation through her. She gasped as she suddenly remembered something important.</p>
<p>“C-Chief… y-you didn’t… ah… use protection…”</p>
<p>Her body tensed at the realization. At the hotel, they had always been careful, but here—everything had happened so quickly.</p>
<p>Jae-heon didn’t stop. Instead, he spoke with calm certainty.</p>
<p>“There isn’t any in my house.”</p>
<p>She blinked. “W-What?”</p>
<p>“I don’t bring women home.”</p>
<p>Her breath hitched.</p>
<p>Jae-heon let out a small chuckle, his voice dropping lower.</p>
<p>“To clarify—I don’t bring women home for this.”</p>
<p>His words sent a shiver through her. He held her closer, his movements deep and slow, drawing her further into his rhythm. The tension between them grew, pulling her deeper into the moment.</p>
<p>“W-What? Right now… ah…!”</p>
<p>Goyo’s breath hitched as she tried to process his words.</p>
<p>Jae-heon didn’t seem interested in explaining himself further. Instead, he simply tightened his grip on her waist, continuing his slow, deliberate movements. Every shift of his hips sent a wave of heat through her, his teasing rhythm making it impossible to think straight.</p>
<p>He let out a deep breath, his gaze lowering.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry. I took care of it.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s eyes widened. “Took care of… what?”</p>
<p>She glanced down instinctively, her mind struggling to catch up.</p>
<p>Jae-heon met her gaze, his tone as calm as ever. “No need to worry about pregnancy.”</p>
<p>Her breath caught. “W-What do you mean?”</p>
<p>He wasn’t wearing protection, yet he was completely unconcerned. And then it clicked.</p>
<p>“Wait… are you saying—”</p>
<p>Jae-heon gave a small smirk. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>A sudden rush of emotions hit her all at once. Confusion, curiosity, and something else she couldn’t quite name.</p>
<p>Vasectomy? Why would he…?</p>
<p>She had always assumed that was something older men, usually married ones, opted for. But Jae-heon was young, wealthy, and undeniably attractive. It wasn’t hard to imagine women lining up for him.</p>
<p>Did he do it because he didn’t want to take any risks?</p>
<p>A strange feeling settled in her chest. She hadn’t expected him to be the type to settle down, but still… something about it tugged at her.</p>
<p>Jae-heon tilted his head, watching her expression shift. “You’re giving me a look.”</p>
<p>Goyo quickly averted her gaze, but the unspoken questions lingered between them.</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s hips jerked harder, as if he were chastising Silo for thinking him strange.</p>
<p>“Well, I haven’t f*cked you without a condom in a while.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon gyrated Goyo’s tightly clenched ass and slammed into her hole. His balls slapped against her a*s, making an obscene, grinding noise. A grunting sound filled the foyer, and the sensor lights on the front door flickered off and on with their movements.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ah…… ahh!”</p>
<p>A sobbing moan intertwined with the sound of slapping flesh.</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve ever f<em>cked your p</em>ssy raw.”</p>
<p>His low voice, accompanied by hot exhalations, stirred my flesh.</p>
<p>He shook her body as he thrust into her at a rapid pace, his blood-red shaft scraping against her inner walls.</p>
