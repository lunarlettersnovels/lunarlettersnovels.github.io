            <p><strong>Chapter 28.2</strong></p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun’s father, Lee Yi-taek, was a politician aiming for the highest office.</p>
<p>There are many ways to gain public support. But every method requires money. The higher the competition, the higher the stakes—running for president alone officially costs around 50 billion won. If you count the untraceable expenses, the total can easily exceed 100 billion won. That number wasn’t an exaggeration.</p>
<p>That’s why Lee Yi-taek desperately needed the help of Kwon Moo-young, the king of cash and private loans. But because he failed to rein in the reckless womanizing of his only son, Lee Yoon-gun, he now risked making an enemy of Kwon Moo-young. Thanks to his son’s philandering, his grand political ambitions were in jeopardy.</p>
<p>In truth, Kwon Jae-heon felt no particular emotion toward Min Jei or Lee Yoon-gun. A man and a woman sleeping together after falling for each other? Hardly a matter worth his concern.</p>
<p>But when it came to his business or his belongings, greed was something he could never tolerate.</p>
<p>The KJ Museum, which had been given away due to his father’s late-in-life love affair, had originally belonged to Jae-heon. He had always planned to reclaim it eventually, but Min Jei’s stupidity made the process far easier than expected.</p>
<p>CEO Kwon, I’ll do whatever you say, please… Y-you can have the museum. Take it. It’s yours. Just… just spare my life.</p>
<p>“With nerves this weak, how did you even manage to cheat?”</p>
<p>I’ll leave the country and live quietly. I swear I won’t appear in front of you again, just please…</p>
<p>Min Jei had realized too late—unnecessary greed wouldn’t just leave her penniless; it might cost her life as well.</p>
<p>Still, thanks to her foolishness, Jae-heon retrieved the museum with minimal effort. Feeling magnanimous, he showed her great mercy—he let her keep everything else she had received from his father, aside from the museum. Not only that, he even let her leave the country unharmed.</p>
<p>Had Jae-heon not intervened to contain Kwon Moo-young’s fury, she wouldn’t have simply lost her home, car, and bank account—she might have ended up in a watery grave at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>In the end, she lost everything she had gained with her body—because of her body.</p>
<p>A castle built on sand could never last, but she had never imagined it would crumble into nothing in an instant.</p>
<p>Kwon Moo-young, Jae-heon’s father, was that kind of man—ruthless, incapable of tolerating even a single mistake. A man so cold-blooded that he could be merciless even to his own child and the woman who bore him. There was no chance he would forgive a mistress who had betrayed him.</p>
<p>Knowing full well what kind of man Kwon Moo-young was, Lee Yi-taek tried to make amends. He sent Lee Goyo to Jae-heon as a gift. Jae-heon was pleased with the offering, so he intended to let the matter rest without escalating it further.</p>
<p>At least, that was the plan—until he came to this hospital room.</p>
<p>“This is fcking ridiculous.”</p>
<p>No matter how much of a reckless fool Yoon-gun was…</p>
<p>He had dared to lay hands on Jae-heon’s possession without permission. Had he known this would happen, he would have half-killed him back then.</p>
<p>“Goyo, what should I do?”</p>
<p>His smile was icy. The twisted curve of his lips looked as if he might sink his teeth into someone’s throat at any moment.</p>
<p>Jae-heon had worked hard to transform many of Kwon Moo-young’s illegal ventures into legitimate businesses, choosing the most gentlemanly and discreet methods whenever possible.</p>
<p>And yet, even a worthless punk like this dared to look down on him. How laughable.</p>
<p>“Tell me. If my baby wants it…”</p>
<p>His eyebrows arched sharply.</p>
<p>But what truly disgusted him wasn’t Yoon-gun himself—it was the way he looked at Goyo. His eyes, his expression. Jae-heon had sensed it back at the Han-young Resort, but now, it was clearer than ever—this twisted, distorted obsession.</p>
<p>But too bad for him.</p>
<p>Because as of yesterday, Goyo was completely his.</p>
<p>Yoon-gun was nothing to her now.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill the bastard for you.”</p>
<p>His low voice carried the weight of his darkened mood.</p>
<p>“Baby, I asked if taking care of Lee Yoon-gun would make you happy.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s gaze tangled with Jae-heon’s. He was the kind of man who could smile while taking a life—one should never forget that.</p>
<p>“P-president…”</p>
<p>“I told you not to call me that. There are better names, aren’t there? ‘Oppa,’ maybe? ‘Honey’? ‘Darling’? So many options.”</p>
<p>“Kwon Jae-heon.”</p>
<p>More terrifying than Lee Yoon-gun, who resorted to violence and abuse as if it were second nature.</p>
<p>More dangerous than Lee Yi-taek, who wielded power from behind a mask.</p>
<p>A man whose fists were closer than the law.</p>
<p>Whose wealth was mightier than any government.</p>
<p>If she wanted to escape the grasp of the Lee family, she had to take Kwon Jae-heon’s hand.</p>
<p>But would a man like him really go against them… all for the sake of a single woman?</p>
<p>Who was she, to make him do that?</p>
