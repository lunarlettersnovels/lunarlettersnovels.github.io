            <p><strong>Chapter 56.1</strong></p>
<p>Boom—</p>
<p>The champagne popped. Everyone erupted in cheers and applause as the white bubbles soared into the air.</p>
<p>As Kwon Moo-young stepped outside the banquet hall, the party officially began.</p>
<p>This year, KJ Finance recorded the highest growth rate in the industry. Words of congratulations were exchanged, and glasses clinked together. The banquet hall was truly festive.</p>
<p>However, the forehead of Kwon Jae-heon, the main character of this party, was deeply furrowed. This was because he could not see Lee Goyo, with whom he was supposed to share a toast.</p>
<p>“Ms. Goyo went outside the banquet hall before Chairman Han left. It seems like it’s been about 10 minutes.”</p>
<p>Executive Director Park Jung-hoon provided the answer Jae-heon wanted before he could even ask.</p>
<p>“She never listens to a word.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon murmured quietly, almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>Despite warning him not to stray from my sight, he clicked his tongue and walked outside the banquet hall.</p>
<p>Since there was no separate contact from the security team, it seemed that Goyo had not left the building. She was likely somewhere nearby, lost in thought.</p>
<p>After looking around, Jae-heon finally spotted Goyo. She was sitting in a chair in front of a large window at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p>She found a prime spot.</p>
<p>KJ Tower was a state-of-the-art building with 60 floors above ground and 5 below, built with KJ’s immense wealth. Completed earlier this year, it was a new office building equipped with all amenities, but the place where Goyo sat was particularly famous. It even appeared as a related search term when searching for KJ Tower.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the night view visible through the window was worth seeing.</p>
<p>During the day, the Han River; in the evening, a forest of buildings. Regardless of anything else, it was a perfect place to enjoy a drink.</p>
<p>Jae-heon called the floor serving manager. He had a special wine prepared for him to drink with Goyo today. Enjoying wine while looking at the night view seemed like a delightful idea.</p>
<p>He walked leisurely, holding a wine bottle in one hand and two wine glasses nestled between his fingers in the other. The cheerful sound of the glasses clinking together accompanied his every step. It was undeniably a kind and thoughtful gesture, delivering wine personally for his missing partner…</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s that?”</p>
<p>A <em>fly </em>buzzed around Goyo.</p>
<p>Just moments ago, she had been alone, but in the brief time Jae-heon was preparing the wine, a pesky little fly had appeared.</p>
<p>Who would have thought there would be someone bold enough to hit on the partner of Executive Director Kwon Jae-heon at the KJ Finance year-end party?</p>
<p>Irritation surged to the top of Jae-heon’s head looking at the man who have suddenly approached Goyo.</p>
<p>“Annoying.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t tell who the intruder was just by looking at his back.</p>
<p>Jae-heon hurriedly moved forward, furrowing his brow to get a better look at the fly’s face. The cheerful sound of clinking glasses grew increasingly precarious.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>December 31st, 8:00 [p.m.](<a href="https://p.m.)/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://p.m.)</a></p>
<p>While Jae-heon was caught up with Kwon Moo-young, Goyo quietly slipped out of the banquet hall. The suffocating tension and the persistent gazes made it impossible for her to stay inside.</p>
<p>She walked aimlessly down the hallway until she reached a table and chairs in front of a large window. It seemed like a space meant for sitting and resting.</p>
<p>Goyo plopped down into a chair.</p>
<p>The night view outside was beautiful. Perhaps because it was the end of the year, each building was adorned with dazzling lights.</p>
<p>She rested her chin on her hand and stared blankly at the scenery outside. The colorful lights somewhat eased her troubled heart.</p>
<p>Clank clank— The sound of champagne popping echoed from inside the banquet hall, followed by cheers. It seemed the party was starting.</p>
<p>“Happy New Year.”</p>
<p>Goyo whispered a quiet New Year’s greeting to herself, a few hours early, while looking out the window. She felt that if she didn’t do it now, she wouldn’t have a moment to celebrate herself quietly.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a shadow fell over her.</p>
<p>“I’m glad the snow stopped. I thought it would keep falling all day until morning.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“They say it will snow again in the early morning, though.”</p>
<p>It was an unfamiliar voice. She turned her gaze to confirm and found a man she had never seen before.</p>
<p>“Ms. Goyo, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p>“…Do you know me?”</p>
<p>Goyo’s gaze scanned the area behind the unfamiliar man. People were carrying food, and others were on their phones.</p>
<p>If anything dangerous were to happen, she could call for help with a single scream. Perhaps sensing her anxious heart, the man smiled and spoke gently.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to be on guard. I’m on your side, Ms. Goyo.”</p>
