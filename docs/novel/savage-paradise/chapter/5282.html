            <p><strong>Chapter 42.2</strong></p>
<p>Jae-heon suddenly lifted her up, gripping her firmly by the hips. The shift in weight made her body sway dangerously. Startled, Goyo flailed her arms in an attempt to steady herself. In the process, she accidentally struck his head and shoulder.</p>
<p>“Look at you—speaking so casually and even throwing punches now.”</p>
<p>He leaned back slightly to avoid her flailing arms, but the movement caused her to completely lose her balance.</p>
<p>Thud.</p>
<p>Her head hit the shoe cabinet behind them before she slid down the smooth wall, only stopping when her arms instinctively wrapped around her own head to protect herself.</p>
<p>“Ah—Jae-heon, put me down.”</p>
<p>Her voice was as desperate as her situation was precarious.</p>
<p>She was now lying back against the floor, her arms reaching for him, her legs still loosely wrapped around his waist. With her skirt flipped up, she was completely exposed to him, making her breath hitch in embarrassment.</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s voice came out oddly strained.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen you in this position before.”</p>
<p>Like a small creature caught in the gaze of a predator. Or maybe, she thought wryly, more like a bat, left dangling upside down. Blood rushed to her head, making her dizzy.</p>
<p>Her skirt had ridden up, leaving her vulnerable under his sharp gaze. And then came his low murmur, voice thick with something unreadable.</p>
<p>“You’re trembling.”</p>
<p>“W-What do you mean?”</p>
<p>His next words sent a fresh wave of heat rushing through her.</p>
<p>“Even like this, you’re beautiful.”</p>
<p>She squeezed her eyes shut, unable to process the overwhelming situation.</p>
<p>“I like it.”</p>
<p>One of his hands steadied her while the other traced over her exposed skin. The rough glide of his fingers sent a shiver up her spine. But the angle was awkward, the positioning making it difficult for him to move the way he wanted.</p>
<p>“W-Wait… this isn’t—!”</p>
<p>She tensed instinctively, and in that moment, his grip faltered.</p>
<p>A breathless chuckle left his lips.</p>
<p>“You’re really my type.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a compliment or anything pleasant.</p>
<p>“A pervert who’s not picky about location or position… it’s crazy.”</p>
<p>He murmured lowly.</p>
<p>“C-could you help me up… my back… it hurts.”</p>
<p>Since Jae-heon was supporting her by her hips, her back was arched, and her head was touching the floor. She hadn’t used these back muscles much before, so they were strained. She could feel tension in the muscles along her spine. Her legs, still around his waist, were weakening.</p>
<p>“We don’t want you to hurt your back, do we?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s voice, full of amusement, came through. Goyo couldn’t look up, feeling too embarrassed.</p>
<p>He chuckled lightly and lifted her with both arms, supporting her back and hips, helping her stand straight. Finally, with her body upright, Goyo wrapped her arms around his neck and sighed in relief.</p>
<p>“Th-thank you.”</p>
<p>Was she supposed to be grateful for this? Part of her wanted to cry.</p>
<p>“It’s good to see your face.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s smile tilted slightly. It was so charming that Goyo couldn’t help but look at him for a moment, her heart tightening in her chest.</p>
<p>“…I feel the same.”</p>
<p>She said it, though she couldn’t bring herself to look him in the eyes and turned her gaze away. Her heart started racing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Her skirt had risen above her waist, and her legs were still around his waist. The position felt improper.</p>
<p>“C-could you let me down?”</p>
<p>“Not yet.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon gave her a light pat on the hip with his large hand. Goyo jumped, startled, and blurted out something.</p>
<p>“W-well, I… should have dinner, right?”</p>
<p>It was her way of trying to escape the situation.</p>
<p>“It’s not even time for dinner yet. Let’s take care of you first.”</p>
<p>His breath brushed against her ear, sending a shiver down her spine.</p>
<p>“Once we’re done, I’ll make you something delicious.”</p>
<p>“Maybe… just some whiskey…”</p>
<p>She wished for an escape, anywhere but here.</p>
<p>“It’s better to enjoy things with a clear mind.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon didn’t seem to have any intention of leaving, remaining still as ever. His breath, warm and close, felt like a constraint, pulling her deeper into the moment.</p>
