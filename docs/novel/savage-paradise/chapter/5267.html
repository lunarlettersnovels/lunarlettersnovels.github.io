            <p><strong>Chapter 50.1</strong></p>
<p>‘Yoon-gun’s longest relationship didn’t last more than 100 days.’</p>
<p>Like a campfire that burns briefly, or it could spread into a wildfire that engulfs the entire mountain.</p>
<p>If he was no different from Yoon-gun, then Kwon Jae-heon wouldn’t maintain a long-term relationship with any woman either. Right now, he was treating her well because they were in the early stages of something new.</p>
<p>‘I’m kind to my woman.’</p>
<p>That must mean he is kind to his sexual partners. In the past, it was another woman, and now it was her.</p>
<p>She shouldn’t take his words at face value or interpret them however she wanted. The moment she thought she was a special woman, she would fall into the swamp of delusion and ultimately get hurt.</p>
<p>The idea that a bad man changes because of her only happens in novels. Reality is a swamp.</p>
<p>Right now, he might act like he would give her everything, but one can never know what lies within a person.</p>
<p>‘Goyo, get a grip.’</p>
<p>She steadied her wavering heart. She shouldn’t trust Kwon Jae-heon or anyone else. The lesson she had learned most painfully in her short life was that one should not trust people.</p>
<p>Love between men and women can change, even when they act as if they will love each other forever. She couldn’t believe the words spoken in the throes of pleasure during sex.</p>
<p>Beeep—.</p>
<p>[Baby, the snake keeps opening its mouth. Ugh, it’s gross.]</p>
<p>“Snake?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon had said he was going to meet a client for something important. Why was there a snake involved? Did the client have a pet snake?</p>
<p>After all, these days, the upper class was known to keep rare animals instead of just dogs or cats. If they could keep crocodiles, why not snakes?</p>
<p>Beeep—.</p>
<p>[Wow, it has a good appetite. It eats everything.]</p>
<p>[You should calm it down.]</p>
<p>That was all she could say. She didn’t know who he was meeting, but since Jae-heon mentioned it was important, it must not be an ordinary person.</p>
<p>[It doesn’t understand human speech; it needs to be calmed down with words. A hawk is the best for taming wild animals, but I can’t hit it.]</p>
<p>[No violence.]</p>
<p>[Ugh. T_T]</p>
<p>[I’m worried it might bite. If it’s a venomous snake, that would be a big problem.]</p>
<p>[I was going to pull its teeth out if it tried to bite, but it keeps acting friendly. Gross!!!!!!]</p>
<p>“Is the snake being friendly?”</p>
<p>Is it a snake and not a dog? Is it because it’s a snake that’s been raised by humans? Goyo tilted her head as she read Jae-heon’s message.</p>
<p>[Should I just make snake wine? ㅡ_ㅡ? I don’t like it!!]</p>
<p>Where on earth did he learn to use such emoticons? It wasn’t a trend these days.</p>
<p>[Isn’t that a bad idea?]</p>
<p>[It’s a bad idea, that’s why I’m letting it slide!!! If I soak it in alcohol and give it to my father, he’d love it. Haha.]</p>
<p>‘So, the old man enjoys drinking snake wine, huh?’</p>
<p>Goyo shuddered at the thought of a snake in a large bottle of liquor. No matter how good it might be for the body, eating something like that… just the thought made her want to vomit.</p>
<p>Still, he was managing to keep his cool with an important client. If it were Yoon-gun, he would have probably been beaten up already for bringing a snake he didn’t like.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it seemed he didn’t lose his temper when it came to business-related matters.</p>
<p>“Is this a good thing?”</p>
<p>The fact that she felt relieved just because he wasn’t resorting to violence made her realize that she had somehow become accustomed to Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>She had adapted somewhat to his tireless stamina and rough demeanor. However, she didn’t know much about him. Perhaps that was why his kindness felt endlessly unsettling.</p>
<p>She had heard that people like Kwon Jae-heon viewed marriage and dating as separate entities. For them, marriage was a business. Relationships were formed through business dealings without love, calculating profits. As a result, it was common for them to have mistresses even after getting married.</p>
<p>If a relationship formed for the purpose of marriage was precarious, how much more so was her situation as a one-night stand?</p>
<p>She had been lucky enough to extend her life for a few more days, but the moment Kwon Jae-heon grew tired of her, their relationship would end. The duration might vary slightly depending on Jae-heon’s whims, but the fact that it was a relationship with a predetermined end was undeniable.</p>
<p>“…Phew.”</p>
<p>She sighed as she looked at the bodyguards standing around her.</p>
<p>They were people Kwon Jae-heon had forcibly assigned to her. Even when she was hospitalized, there were bodyguards watching over her outside, and today, they followed her on her outing without fail.</p>
