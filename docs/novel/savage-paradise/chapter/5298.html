            <p><strong>Chapter 34.2</strong></p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon chuckled, pushing back the hair that had fallen across his forehead.</p>
<p>“Some people complain that they can’t date because they’re busy taking care of others, but it’s really just because of their own terrible personality.”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon raised his voice, then quickly trailed off, glancing at his sister as if he was afraid of her.</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa, however, didn’t seem to care about her brother’s antics and was savoring the taste of her coffee.</p>
<p>“Park Jung-hoon does tend to cause trouble. He did something big when he came back to Korea, too.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything! What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“You weren’t involved in that drug scandal?”</p>
<p>“Hey! That was a false accusation! It wasn’t me, I swear!”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon jumped up at Kwon Jae-heon’s words.</p>
<p>Among the people Park Jung-hoon knew, there were a few who were normally decent but became dirty when they were with women. They had been caught and disgraced for taking drugs and engaging in group activities with women, but Park Jung-hoon himself was not involved. He was only mentioned because he knew them.</p>
<p>“I’m innocent,” Park Jung-hoon said, his face red with anger, claiming that he was not involved in the scandal, but was only suspected because of his association with the wrong crowd.</p>
<p>“Okay, fine. But wasn’t your divorce due to your promiscuous lifestyle and the end of your marriage? And didn’t President Park try to cover up that article…?”</p>
<p>“That’s not true! My divorce was not because of that… Ah, damn it! I couldn’t even tell anyone the truth without being accused of lying.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere had completely turned in Kwon Jae-heon’s favor. No matter what Park Jung-hoon said, Kwon Jae-heon was not affected at all. On the other hand, Park Jung-hoon was becoming more and more unfavorable.</p>
<p>It was true that he had been involved in a drug scandal and that there were strange rumors about him after his divorce.</p>
<p>“Whatever, it’s none of my business,” Kwon Jae-heon said, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>While he was attacking Park Jung-hoon with his words, Kwon Jae-heon’s gaze was directed at Goyo.</p>
<p>Goyo was completely bewildered. She had not expected this situation to arise when Kwon Jae-heon appeared at the meeting with Park Jung-hoon.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, “You can know the depths of the ocean, but you can’t know the depths of human nature.” Park Jung-hoon’s words and actions in front of her were gentlemanly, but it seemed that behind her back, he was a completely different person.</p>
<p>He was involved with drugs and infidelity, and was not someone she should associate with. This was why you had to experience things for yourself to understand people.</p>
<p>“Director Park,it’s better to just get it over with. Just answer the phone.” Kwon Jae-heon taunted.</p>
<p>“You don’t know anything!”</p>
<p>The winner of this fight was already determined from the start. Including his sister, even his father was on Kwon Jae-heon’s side. Park Jung-hoon had no chance of winning.</p>
<p>“Ugh, what does he want to say now?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon grumbled to himself and pressed the call button.</p>
<p>“Yes, father?”</p>
<p>―You bastard! I know you arbitrarily assigned that article to that spot!!</p>
<p>“Ah, damn it. Did you eat ginseng stir-fry recently? I know, I know, don’t yell at me… You have high blood pressure, so please… Ah, okay, got it!”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon took the phone away from his ear and grumbled, still listening to the loud yelling from the other end of the line.</p>
<p>‘It seems Director Park was raised with love.’</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon’s tone and expression, as he struggled to communicate, were unmistakably those of a reckless and spoiled youngest son of a wealthy family.</p>
<p>He was afraid of his father and was cautious around his sister, but the way he interacted with Lee Yi-taek and Lee Yoon-gun was completely different.</p>
