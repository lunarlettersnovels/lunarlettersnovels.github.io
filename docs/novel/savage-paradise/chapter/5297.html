            <p><strong>Chapter 35.1</strong></p>
<p>‘And he gets along with his sister,’ Goyo thought as she observed the pair.</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa’s expression as she looked at Park Jung-hoon didn’t convey any hatred or anger. It was just a sense of annoyance, like “our troublesome youngest son has caused another problem.”</p>
<p>Unlike Lee Yoon-gun, who would have started yelling and throwing punches, Park Seo-hwa was calmly observing the situation, enjoying the subtle aroma of coffee and the sweetness of the chocolate cake. She didn’t seem to want to intervene in the situation at their table until Kwon Jae-heon had resolved the issue and Park Jung-hoon had left on his own.</p>
<p>Goyo, who had been watching Park Seo-hwa, tilted her head.</p>
<p>Had they met at an event before?</p>
<p>It seemed familiar, but she couldn’t quite place it. It wasn’t a recent memory, but rather a faint one, like an old, damaged black-and-white photo.</p>
<p>As if she had noticed Goyo’s gaze, Park Seo-hwa’s eyes suddenly turned towards her, and she smiled faintly.</p>
<p>A strange sense of longing washed over Goyo, and her eyes pricked with tears. She felt a pang of envy towards the subtle family bond between Park Seo-hwa and Park Jung-hoon, and her father’s face flashed in her mind.</p>
<p>“Hey,” Kwon Jae-heon said, tapping his finger on the table.</p>
<p>“Now, look at me.”</p>
<p>His dark eyes, which seemed to be bottomless, were staring at her. Goyo swallowed hard as she met his gaze.</p>
<p>She had only looked away from him for a moment, distracted by the strange feeling she got from Park Seo-hwa. Before that, her eyes had been fixed on Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>She had taken in every detail of his appearance, from his neatly creased dress pants to his finely crafted leather shoes, and the way he had crossed his long legs and turned his body towards her.</p>
<p>“I think you left the gift I gave you at the hotel.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon casually pulled out the necklace from his jacket pocket. Goyo’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>‘No way, did he just–’</p>
<p>“I gave it to you as a gift, so you should take good care of it.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s eyes shook violently as Kwon Jae-heon pulled out the 1 billion won necklace from his pocket.</p>
<p>“Is that… the one you just pulled out of your pocket?”</p>
<p>“Why? What’s wrong with that?”</p>
<p>Goyo’s voice rose, uncharacteristically. It was because no one in the world would casually carry a 1 billion won necklace in their pocket without a case.</p>
<p>“Is there a rule that says you can’t put a necklace in your pocket?”</p>
<p>“There’s no rule, but… that’s… that’s so expensive…”</p>
<p>Goyo was a commoner at heart, despite being raised under Lee Yi-taek’s care.</p>
<p>Even by upper-class standards, the necklace was not cheap, and yet Kwon Jae-heon was handling it so carelessly. Goyo was at a loss for how to react, but fortunately, Park Jung-hoon intervened.</p>
<p>“You! You… that… that necklace?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon’s eyes widened in shock, and he started yelling at Kwon Jae-heon, forgetting that he was still on the phone with his father. He stuttered and couldn’t even finish his sentence.</p>
<p>“You crazy bastard, how can you… treat it like that?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon, who had grown up as the grandson of the owner of the 100-year-old media conglomerate Sungjo Daily, was shocked to this extent. Goyo realized that her reaction was normal, and it was Kwon Jae-heon who was being abnormal, treating a precious item like a cheap trinket from a street vendor.</p>
<p>“If you handle it carelessly, I’ll handle it carelessly too.”</p>
<p>“Is that my fault?”</p>
<p>Goyo’s eyes trembled.</p>
<p>“If you’re worried, you can take good care of it yourself.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon effortlessly put the diamond necklace around Goyo’s neck. Although she had received the gift again, Goyo’s body involuntarily shrank back.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you again, it’s yours.”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>He was shamelessly saying it was hers, even though he knew she was at the auction.</p>
<p>If Ji Seo-hyun had been with him, would he have said the same thing? It seemed like he would say anything to get what he wanted.</p>
<p>Everyone at the auction, including Goyo, thought the same thing: if the woman who went up to the room hadn’t changed, the owner of the necklace would have been Ji Seo-hyun, not Goyo.</p>
<p>As Goyo’s expression turned bitter, Kwon Jae-heon said firmly:</p>
<p>“I bought it for you.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon had been bothered by Goyo’s gaze since the charity event. He didn’t like how she was receiving attention from the young men around her.</p>
<p>When he saw Park Jung-hoon sitting next to Goyo at the auction, Kwon Jae-heon made up his mind to give her the best gift at the event.</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon seemed to have the same idea, as he participated in the auction, and the price of the necklace skyrocketed. Thanks to that, Kwon Jae-heon was able to give Park Jung-hoon a sense of defeat and put a heavy chain on Goyo.</p>
<p>The value of the necklace was well worth it.</p>
<p>“It’s a gift to win your heart.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon seemed to be saying that he wouldn’t argue about the necklace anymore.</p>
<p>“….A gift to win my heart?”</p>
