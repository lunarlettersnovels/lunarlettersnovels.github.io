            <p><strong>Chapter 36.2</strong></p>
<p>“Isn’t it the third day today?”</p>
<p>“…Three days?”</p>
<p>Was he counting from Friday? Goyo’s cheeks turned bright red.</p>
<p>She couldn’t understand why he was calling her his woman, just because they had slept together once. He wasn’t even taking responsibility for his actions.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed that the guy you cheated with me for is just Director Park. I expected more.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>As Goyo and Kwon Jae-heon continued their conversation, Park Jung-hoon seemed to have finished his phone call with his father. He pouted and tried to pick a fight with Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“I’m a better husband material than you,” Park Jung-hoon said, despite being a divorced man.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon chuckled at Park Jung-hoon’s comment, finding it ridiculous.</p>
<p>“I have a clean record, unlike some people,” Kwon Jae-heon said.</p>
<p>“A clean record doesn’t mean anything if you have a complicated relationship with women,” Park Jung-hoon sneered.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon paused for a moment before speaking, as if he had just remembered something.</p>
<p>“Do you know that my girl likes big ones?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon smiled and looked at Park Jung-hoon’s lower body, his gaze full of mockery. He then whispered to Goyo, “Don’t worry about Park Jung-hoon, I’ll take care of it. He’s small.”</p>
<p>Goyo’s eyes involuntarily turned to Park Jung-hoon’s lower body, and she tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>Do men usually share the size of their private parts with each other?</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon’s face turned bright red as he realized what was happening.</p>
<p>“No, that’s not true! Don’t listen to him, he’s lying!”</p>
<p>Goyo was baffled by Park Jung-hoon’s reaction, unable to understand why he was getting so worked up.</p>
<p>Just because there are big things, it doesn’t mean there can’t be small things. Just like how there are tall people and short people, and big objects and small objects…</p>
<p>What’s the big deal?</p>
<p>“Don’t look, you’ll go blind,” Kwon Jae-heon said, forcing Goyo’s gaze back to him.</p>
<p>“If you taste my d!ck and then try another guy’s, it won’t be satisfying,” he said, his voice low and husky.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon leaned his elbow on the table, supporting his chin with his hand, and looked at Goyo. Goyo couldn’t say anything, so she just swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“Goyo, I’m not the kind of guy who gets jealous of small d!cks,” he said, his expression confident.</p>
<p>“It’s because there’s no one with a bigger d!ck than me, right? So, it’s better to have a big one, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>His words were like a gentle breeze in her ear, and she found herself nodding along.</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon, who was sitting next to them, looked at Kwon Jae-heon with a shocked expression.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you, what have you been eating?” his face seemed to say.</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon had known Kwon Jae-heon for almost 10 years, attending the same school, but he had never seen him talk so much. Even someone who had known him for a long time like Park Jung-hoon couldn’t get used to Kwon Jae-heon’s personality.</p>
<p>“It’s not small, it’s not small! It’s bigger than the average in Korea!” Park Jung-hoon exclaimed, his eyes wide with indignation.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon just smiled, his eyes glinting with amusement.</p>
<p>“I know Park Jung-hoon’s tastes overlap with mine, but it’s getting old,” Kwon Jae-heon said.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?” Park Jung-hoon asked, his face reddening.</p>
<p>“It’s not just a coincidence that every woman I’m interested in, you’re also interested in. It’s like you’re doing it on purpose,” Kwon Jae-heon said, his eyes glinting with amusement.</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon’s face turned beet red with rage.</p>
<p>For a moment, Goyo had forgotten that Kwon Jae-heon was a man who could kill with his words and violence. It was clear that getting entangled with him would only lead to trouble.</p>
<p>“You’re so arrogant, thinking you can just take whatever you want without considering others,” Park Jung-hoon spat.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kwon Jae-heon! Are you still holding a grudge because Kang Gyuri dumped you and married me?” Park Jung-hoon sneered.</p>
<p>It seemed that Park Jung-hoon was still bitter about losing Gyuri to Kwon Jae-heon, and had been waiting for an opportunity to get back at him. The recent assault incident had been the perfect chance, but Kwon Jae-heon had become too powerful to take on.</p>
<p>As a influential politician and a media mogul, Kwon Jae-heon was now a force to be reckoned with. Park Jung-hoon’s pride wouldn’t let him back down, but he was no match for Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>Just then, Park Jung-hoon mentioned a woman’s name, and Goyo’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>“Gyuri chose me, not you. I’m the one who held her hand and walked into the wedding ceremony,” Kwon Jae-heon said, his voice dripping with confidence.</p>
<p>The mention of Gyuri’s name made Goyo feel like her heart had dropped to the floor.</p>
