            <p><strong>Chapter 17.2</strong></p>
<p>The thrusting of his hips, piercing harder, caused a piercing pain in her vag*na. Her legs trembled with convulsions.</p>
<p>“Shh, that’s right. Good girl. More… Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Huh, hmm, s-stop.”</p>
<p>She repeatedly scraped out and slid back in, making lewd noises on the wet, clinging junction.</p>
<p>For Goyo, it felt like a hot flame stirring inside her. Moans kept bursting out in the boiling heat, and tears clouded her vision.</p>
<p>Jae-heon gently lifted his hips and whispered softly in her ear.</p>
<p>“I’ll try to be gentle. So, call me properly.”</p>
<p>At the sound of “oppa” surrendering from Goyo’s lips, Jae-heon embarrassingly felt a thrilling sense of victory. He had never known he had such a depraved taste.</p>
<p>“This is more dangerous than I thought.” It caused the blood in his veins to boil.</p>
<p>Unintentionally, he was deeply buried inside her and became painfully hard, as if it might burst.</p>
<p>“No need for any drugs. I might get addicted.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon muttered under his breath, exhaling deeply.</p>
<p>“Uh, uh, oppa. Slow… too… huh.”</p>
<p>“Slowly? Is that what you want, or do you want it hard?”</p>
<p>“Sl-slow… pl-please.”</p>
<p>The tense spasms from her extreme pain gradually transitioned into a sensation that almost paralyzed her until suddenly igniting into a searing pleasure that engulfed her entire body like a furnace. Just as a skilled artisan melts iron in a forge to create refined metal, Jae-heon’s relentless thrusts made her body burn and whimper uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Tears that had been welling in Goyo’s eyes finally trickled down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Slowly teasing, hard thrusting, I’ll do whatever you want, so spread your pus*y even wider.”</p>
<p>“Don’t… make… those kinds of… sounds… please…”</p>
<p>Her eyes, moistened with sensitivity, had been reddened for a while. Each slow blink caused droplets clinging to her eyelashes to fall gently.</p>
<p>“When you look at me with those eyes, I can’t hold back.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon repeatedly wiped Goyo’s tear-streaked eyes with his fingers, their dance resonated loudly in the room.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Hmph. …Ugh. Ah!”</p>
<p>Goyo gasped for breath, panting heavily. She clenched her teeth but couldn’t suppress the near-screams escaping through her gritted teeth.</p>
<p>A pillar of fire, as if it would tear her body apart, roughly drilled into her with loud thuds. The giant mass of flesh scratched and stirred her inner walls, making her insides twitch incessantly.</p>
<p>The pleasure rising from her stomach heated her entire body through her veins, surged up to her neck, and pounded against her skull. Fireworks began to explode inside Goyo’s head.</p>
<p>“Is it here?”</p>
<p>As she whimpered as if she were about to pass out, a large smile spread across Jae-heon’s lips.</p>
<p>Seemingly pleased to have found the spot that Goyo felt, Jae-heon began to focus his thrusts there. He moved his hips widely, thrusting hard and deep, pushing Goyo to her limits.</p>
<p>Hitting her sensitive spot hard and driving deep to the root, Goyo eventually twisted her waist and began to scream.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah… Oppa, ugh, ah.”</p>
<p>“It’s pretty deep where you feel it. No one but me could reach it.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon thrust himself wildly, matching the tightening of Goyo’s entrance around the flesh.</p>
<p>“Feels good, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Hah, ah, ah.”</p>
<p>Slap, slap. With the sound of flesh hitting flesh, Goyo’s mouth repeatedly let out moans. Her mind went blank, unable to think of anything.</p>
<p>“Goyo, it feels good, right?”</p>
<p>Lee Goyo had completely collapsed.</p>
<p>Her face, covered in tears, contorted as she clung to his neck.</p>
<p>Yet Jae-heon, as if his thirst was not quenched, continued to thrust relentlessly.</p>
<p>Goyo whimpered incoherently. Her waist bent, and her limbs twisted into strange shapes.</p>
<p>“See, I told you it would feel good.”</p>
<p>It seemed like it would be enough, but the sticky sound of flesh colliding didn’t stop easily. Jae-heon, seemingly intent on releasing all his pent-up desire on Goyo, continued to hold back his cl!max, prolonging the thrusts. Goyo was helplessly pushed up and down by the relentless pounding inside her.</p>
<p>“Hah, hah, ahng! Hah.”</p>
<p>With her moans bordering on screams, Jae-heon’s thrusts grew rougher as he dug deeper inside her. Her folds, constantly pierced by his thick member, were already drenched. Whether it was Jae-heon’s fluids or Goyo’s, everything was slippery and wet from the relentless pounding.</p>
<p>“…I’m glad I’m not the only one excited.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon, his voice dropping a notch, placed his hand on Goyo’s chest. He rolled her n!pple between his fingers, gently scratching it with his fingernail, causing the pink bud to perk up.</p>
<p>“So cute, standing up straight.”</p>
<p>He took her other bre*st into his mouth. His hot, wet tongue licked and sucked the flesh inside, nibbling on the erect peak with his firm teeth.</p>
<p>“Ah, huu, ugh…”</p>
<p>One bre*st was squeezed in his hand, while the other was sucked and bitten in his mouth.</p>
<p>Squelch, slurp. The explicit sound of sucking filled the air. Unswallowed saliva dripped from his lips, trailing down her chest and into her cleavage.</p>
