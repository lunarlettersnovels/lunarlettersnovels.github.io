            <p><strong>Chapter 9.2</strong></p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun’s refusal to let him go proves she has long forgotten their agreement and desires his affection. She showed her longing and felt jealous of other women. She should have backed off when he said he would contact her later, but instead, she followed him to the elevator and pestered him.</p>
<p>Goyo understood this type of man well. He disliked being questioned repeatedly, perhaps viewing it as a challenge to his authority, much like her sponsor, Congressman Lee Yi-taek.</p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun probably noticed. That Kwon Jae-heon’s interest in her disappeared in an instant. He has developed an interest in another woman, and if she loses him here, there won’t be another chance.</p>
<p>The same went for Goyo. If she couldn’t capture Kwon Jae-heon’s interest here today, she would be no different from Ji Seo-hyun. She had to do whatever it took to capture Kwon Jae-heon’s attention.</p>
<p>He left Goyo lingering in the lounge and walked towards the bar table. Taking off his jacket and laying it on the table, he grabbed the knot of his tie firmly around his neck and shook it from side to side. Unbuttoning the top button of his shirt, he sat on a stool.</p>
<p>The chair swiveled around, and his gaze landed on Goyo. He smirked as he still stood at the entrance.</p>
<p>“Anyone would think I dragged you here against your will.”</p>
<p>A hint of annoyance flashed across Jae-heon’s lips. He poured a pumpkin-colored liquid from the whiskey bottle into the empty glass.</p>
<p>Drinking before s<em>x was Jae-heon’s habit. He relaxed his nerves and warmed up his body with the whiskey he had prepared in advance before mixing with the woman. S</em>x, to him, was a tool to relieve fatigue and a means to fall asleep. He thrust his hips until his whole body felt sluggish and then collapsed like he was fainting.</p>
<p>“I’ve only ever done s*x with women in hotels.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon looked at Goyo coolly over the glass he raised. She wrapped her arms around herself as if she sent shivers down her spine.</p>
<p>“It’s not too late even now. If you don’t want to do it with me, just open the door and leave.”</p>
<p>With his head tilted slightly, he stared at Goyo. Emotions were still unreadable on her face.</p>
<p>Instead of her response, his phone on the table vibrated. Jae-heon chuckled dryly, then turned to check his phone. It was Ji Seo-hyun.</p>
<p>[Please contact me if you change your mind. I’ll be waiting in the underground parking lot.]</p>
<p>Upon seeing the message, Jae-heon twisted his lips and raised his phone towards Goyo.</p>
<p>“Ji Seo-hyun says she’s waiting for me in the underground parking lot to have some fun.”</p>
<p>At his words, Goyo’s pupils trembled slightly.</p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun hadn’t left yet? There would surely be plenty of men begging to meet her. Well, it’s not every day a man willingly offers a 10 billion won gift for a night.</p>
<p>Yet, he hadn’t even thought she would be waiting in the underground parking lot. Was this man so remarkable that even a top actress would abandon her pride to cling to him? Seeing even Yi-taek, who seemed flawless, openly encouraging him to seduce, it was clear that Jae-heon’s value exceeded what Goyo had imagined.</p>
<p>“She knows I’m with you, but she’s still waiting.”</p>
<p>For Jae-heon, s*x was simply a physical act to satisfy desire. He had never met a woman who emotionally begged him, expecting responsibility for that act. Most encounters ended after spending a few nights for this reason.</p>
<p>That’s why this kind of persuasion and coaxing was a first for him.</p>
<p>“If I leave, are you going to call Ji Seo-hyun?”</p>
<p>At the mention of Ji Seo-hyun waiting in the parking lot, Goyo’s mind went blank. She knew she had to do something to hold onto him, but she had no data in her head about what to do in such situations.</p>
<p>Just by the way Jae-heon’s eyes roamed up and down her body, she knew he wasn’t disinterested in her. Moreover, today, she was dressed by a famous stylist in a s*xy, trendy style from head to toe.</p>
<p>‘What on earth should I do?’</p>
<p>Goyo was ignorant about playing with men. While she managed to get into the hotel room, what to do next was an entirely different issue.</p>
<p>‘It’s because of Lee Yoon-gun.’</p>
<p>He was strict about Goyo’s romantic affairs, even though he himself indulged in all sorts of misconduct. Because he drove away every man besides Goyo, she had never been able to have a proper relationship.</p>
<p>“Hmm, what answer do you want?”</p>
<p>Leaning on his elbow on the table, Jae-heon looked at her with a relaxed expression, almost seeming at ease.</p>
