            <p><strong>Chapter 3.1</strong></p>
<p>“I, I momentarily lost my mind… I, I made a mistake.”</p>
<p>At the mention of killing, Min Jei was taken aback. She trembled at the thought of what he might really do to her. Lee Yoon-gun was the one who was lynched, but Min Jei couldn’t even catch her breath properly.</p>
<p>“Was it a mistake?” The man lazily exhaled smoke as he asked.</p>
<p>Now, she was at least wearing underwear, but when he barged into the room, the two of them were naked and entwined like animals, panting in broad daylight.</p>
<p>“I can understand that, I suppose. You’re young and can go crazy over a young man’s c*ck.”</p>
<p>His voice was soft, but with each word, it became a sharp knife that pierced Minje.</p>
<p>“Hmm, and when you’re fuck!ng, you think you don’t care if you die.”</p>
<p>The man fixed his sharp gaze on Minje, pointing at Lee Yoon-gun with a chin that seemed sculpted by a master craftsman.</p>
<p>“But still, isn’t that going too far?”</p>
<p>The man flicked the ash off his cigarette into the ashtray before pulling out another one from the pack. With a cheerful click, the lid opened, and as the lighter wheel turned, a bright flame emerged, drawing into the cigarette’s tip.</p>
<p>Taking a deep drag and then exhaling a long puff of smoke, the man said, “If you just pick up and eat anything because you’re hungry, you’ll get indigestion.”</p>
<p>The smoke wafted through the air like crashing waves, mingling with the sunlight by the window, casting a subtle blue hue. It was elegant and beautiful, akin to an art performance, if not for the violence witnessed before.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, Lee Yoon-gun burst out yelling as if seized by a fit.</p>
<p>The one most surprised by the outburst was Goyo. The genre of the mental movie playing in his head shifted from an artistic film to a gangster flick.</p>
<p>“Damn it, do you know who I am?! You know who my father is, right!”</p>
<p>He should have just stayed quiet. That hot-headed fool, his temper couldn’t be controlled even with a slap.</p>
<p>Unable to bear being compared to someone or looked down upon, Lee Yoon-gun couldn’t control his temper and worsened the situation. Goyo opened her mouth with a wishful plea.</p>
<p>“Yoon-gun oppa, please stop…”</p>
<p>Her voice was too soft, her earnest plea didn’t seem to reach Lee Yoon-gun at all.</p>
<p>“Nuna, you love me! She was with me before you.”</p>
<p>“Enough.” Goyo’s faint voice was drowned out by Lee Yoon-gun’s desperate outburst. Without giving her a chance to intervene, Lee Yoon-gun dragged the situation to a breaking point.</p>
<p>“I… I met her first. You two met later. Y-yes… That’s right… But I didn’t know! I didn’t do anything wrong!”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun’s shameless self-justification made Goyo feel dizzy.</p>
<p>Even if she begged the man for forgiveness, would it be enough now? No matter how much she lived her life without caring about others’ opinions, she still had to behave considering the other person.</p>
<p>That man isn’t someone to be trifled with by the power of Yi’s family. That’s why he probably left Lee Yoon-gun beaten up like that. And above all, if that man were easy to deal with, Yi-taek wouldn’t have rushed to send Goyo away.</p>
<p>“You think I’m funny.”</p>
<p>The man’s muffled bass voice rose as he tossed his cigarette at his feet.</p>
<p>‘Yoon-gun, why did you do that.’</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun obviously couldn’t read the atmosphere. It was obvious that the man was barely containing his anger while smoking his cigarette. Yet, Lee Yoon-gun dared to provoke him fearlessly.</p>
<p>As the man kicked the ash with his foot and took a step forward, the men surrounding Lee Yoon-gun stopped the violence and stepped aside.</p>
<p>Thud, thud.</p>
<p>Goyo’s ears perceived the sound of the man’s boots as the footsteps of the Grim Reaper heralding death.</p>
<p>The man’s shadow swept across the smooth marble floor like a snake, looming over Lee Yoon-gun’s head. As the polished tip of his shoe gleamed under the light and reached Lee Yoon-gun’s face, one of the rugged men lifted him up and forced him to kneel.</p>
<p>The man leaned his sharp jaw eerily and lowered his upper body.</p>
<p>“Care to say that again?”</p>
<p>The man furrowed his brow, lifting the corners of his mouth sharply.</p>
<p>“I-I’m not… not the… the one who… uh.”</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying I was the one who had an affair?”</p>
<p>The man’s gaze turned icy cold.</p>
<p>“She said she didn’t have a boyfriend… If anything else, she cheated on me! I didn’t wrong you!”</p>
<p>It was one of Lee Yoon-gun’s habits—to stubbornly insist that he was right no matter what. He would persist recklessly, without considering the consequences, until his lies eventually turned into truths.</p>
<p>“Getting treated like a second option must be amusing.”He didn’t look amused at all The man’s voice, flowing through his twisted lips, sent shivers down the spine.</p>
<p>“I-I’m innocent… Aaagh!”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun’s desperate scream erupted from his mouth despite his claims of innocence.</p>
