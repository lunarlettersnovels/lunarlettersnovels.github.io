            <p><strong>Chapter 30.1</strong></p>
<p>Wouldn’t failing to stop violence also be a sin?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It was hard to tell if it was a monologue or a question. After a moment of silence, his impatient prodding came crashing down.</p>
<p>“Goyo, your father is asking you something.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Goyo looked at Lee Yi-taek and answered calmly. After all, any answer that went against his will didn’t even exist as an option.</p>
<p>“You also know what you did wrong, don’t you.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He was criticizing her for not stopping Kwon Jae-heon from assaulting Lee Yoon-gun. Completely disregarding the fact that Lee Yoon-gun had beaten her. She was a victim, not an accomplice, but that’s not how Lee Yi-taek saw it.</p>
<p>“Do you know what I’m asking when you answer?”</p>
<p>“That violence is bad, right?”</p>
<p>Perhaps because of Kwon Jae-heon’s assault on Lee Yoon-gun last night, all the articles he read were about violence. A month ago, he’d let it slide because it was Lee Yoon-gun’s fault, but this time, Lee Yi-taek saw it as senseless violence.</p>
<p>“It seems CEO Kwon took a liking to you. Seeing as he had you hospitalized for just a brief fainting spell.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>His face was full of displeasure.</p>
<p>To hear even a single word of praise from Lee Yi-taek, Lee Goyo had sold her body to Kwon Jae-heon. But he didn’t offer her even a small compliment, let alone comfort, while she lay in the hospital.</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>“Can’t even take care of one pretty face.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>This</em> face is what your son did to me. He threw a fit, saying he’d die if I didn’t come to the hospital, and then his hand just flew up.</p>
<p>If Kwon Jae-heon hadn’t stepped in to stop him, she wouldn’t have woken up so nicely, if at all.</p>
<p>‘It was the same four years ago.’</p>
<p>A male classmate had walked her home. Lee Yoon-gun saw them and went ballistic, brutally beating both Goyo and the classmate. Goyo was seriously injured and hospitalized for a long time. The hospital she was admitted to back then was also Han-young Hospital.</p>
<p>“Both of my children are causing trouble and ending up in the hospital.”</p>
<p>“Is oppa okay?”</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He’d taken the full brunt of Kwon Jae-heon’s anger, so there was no way he was okay. Kicked, stomped, and burned with cigarettes.</p>
<p>“You can’t hide your lowly origins.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek had received a call directly from the hospital director in the early morning. When he arrived at the hospital, Lee Yoon-gun was in emergency surgery.</p>
<p>Yoon-gun’s condition was serious. He had more than ten fractures in his wrists, the backs of his hands, and his ribs, and especially severe second-degree burns all over the backs of his hands. Compared to what happened a month ago at Han-young Resort, where Kwon Jae-heon had basically let Lee Yoon-gun go, the extent of his injuries this time was severe.</p>
<p>His wrist was crushed, requiring surgery and a cast, and the backs of his hands, burned with cigarettes, were swollen and wrapped in bandages after burn treatment. There were bruises all over his body from being kicked.</p>
<p>The police had arrived late after someone reported it, but no one was willing to talk about the perpetrator.</p>
<p>“… Acting like a gangster, what else is new.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek couldn’t hide his displeasure.</p>
<p>‘Looks like he’ll get away with it again this time.’</p>
<p>Seeing him just huff and puff like that, it was clear Lee Yi-taek wouldn’t sue Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“Can’t even meet my own daughter as I please.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean…”</p>
<p>“Those guys in front of the room. Who do they think they are, daring to block me?”</p>
<p>Goyo didn’t know anything about it.</p>
<p>It seemed Kwon Jae-heon had placed his own people outside the hospital room without asking. Since it was the same hospital as Lee Yoon-gun, he must have put them there in case he came barging in again.</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun was capable of anything. However, there was no reason for Kwon Jae-heon to be so kind to her.</p>
<p>‘I’m kind to my women.’</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s words suddenly popped into her head.</p>
<p>No way. Did Kwon Jae-heon have feelings for her? Not just a one-night stand?</p>
<p>“That young punk is getting too cocky.”</p>
<p><em>Vibrate, vibrate.</em></p>
<p>The phone’s vibration made Goyo turn her head. Her phone was on the metal drawer next to the bed, plugged into the charger.</p>
<p>‘Ah, the phone was dead.’</p>
<p>Did Kwon Jae-heon charge it too? He’s more thoughtful than she thought.</p>
<p>She reached out and picked up the phone. But there was a small note underneath it. Goyo grabbed the paper along with the phone, trying not to let Lee Yi-taek notice.</p>
<p>[Make sure you answer the call!]</p>
<p>A short and simple message. Even as she read it, the phone kept ringing.</p>
<p><em>Vibrate – vibrate.</em></p>
<p>It was an unregistered number, but her gut told her. It was Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
