            <p><strong>Chapter 41.1</strong></p>
<p>“You want me to go down on you…”</p>
<p>His blunt words made her cheeks flush.</p>
<p>Was it because he was disappointed I hadn’t done it last time? If I were to perform a clumsy attempt now, perhaps he’d decide never to ask again. After all, I would only be doing it half-heartedly…</p>
<p>Goyo lowered her eyes hesitantly, and she could clearly see the matter at hand.</p>
<p>“If you expect too much, you’ll be disappointed.”</p>
<p>The size was so imposing that even a resigned sigh escaped her. Looking at the enormous silhouette boldly displayed over the navy fabric—a shape no thin cloth could ever conceal—a sudden fear gripped her heart.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’ll work…” she murmured, even though her sentence was left unfinished, her answer coming back curtly.</p>
<p>“Everything’s set.”</p>
<p>“Set?”</p>
<p>How many women must have gone down on him for him to be so confident? Jae-heon smiled smugly at Goyo’s incredulous look, as if it were nothing.</p>
<p>“I understand—my size is indeed rather considerable.”</p>
<p>“Not just a little, but quite a lot!”</p>
<p>Goyo’s eyes widened sharply. She had never openly admitted to ever being overwhelmed by a man’s size. If she were to try and take it in recklessly, it would surely be too much for her jaw. Even if she managed to accommodate it with care, the consequences were something she didn’t even want to imagine.</p>
<p>“Could it cause a tear?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon ran his long finger along her lips. The slightly sticky, moist touch made her skin prickle.</p>
<p>“Probably,” she sighed and weakly nodded.</p>
<p>Every space in the world has its limits. Her mouth isn’t made of rubber that can stretch indefinitely, and trying to take that in would surely lead to trouble.</p>
<p>“I’m not really fond of performing such acts when there’s any sign of injury,” he remarked matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>Jae-heon, too, seemed to be weighing his options. Possessing something quite extraordinary, he knew he had to be cautious when requesting actions that defied ordinary limits.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Don’t just say you absolutely can’t—show me that you’re really trying,” he said, his glance urging her to be more proactive.</p>
<p>Goyo hadn’t wished to be pushed into making an extra effort. She gently bit her lip.</p>
<p>“Once you try, you’ll get used to it.”</p>
<p>“…Well, I suppose so,” she replied hesitantly.</p>
<p>Is it really necessary to strain so much for something like this?</p>
<p>Goyo struggled to hold back the surge of emotion rising in her throat.</p>
<p>“I’ll let it be inserted, so try to appreciate it.”</p>
<p>“N-now?” she stammered.</p>
<p>“Yes, now.”</p>
<p>“The option of not doing it…”</p>
<p>“There is no such option.”</p>
<p>Before she could protest further, Jae-heon placed his hands on her shoulders and gently but firmly pressed her down. Overwhelmed by his insistence, Goyo had no choice but to bend her knees and lower herself between his long, outstretched legs.</p>
<p>A prominent, unmistakable presence came into view, and seeing it so clearly only doubled her apprehension. Her eyes widened in uncertainty.</p>
<p>“Honey, don’t just stand there—get moving,” he said, tapping the buckle of his pants with his finger.</p>
<p>“Let’s start by unfastening the buckle,” he instructed.</p>
<p>She cast a sidelong glance at the buckle, a mix of reluctance and defiance in her eyes. With a soft chuckle, he gently pulled her hand closer, guiding her fingertips to the buckle.</p>
<p>She swallowed hard, her dry throat betraying her tension.</p>
<p>Goyo fumbled with her fingers as she managed to unfasten the buckle and open the front flap.</p>
<p>“Go ahead—slide your hand in and feel it. Yes, just like that,” Jae‐heon instructed. Following his directions, she carefully slipped her hand into his dark underwear. There, she felt a firm, partially erect shaft. With a few more subtle movements, the tip emerged slightly from the fabric, already moist from a clear sign of arousal. At the sight of its confident display, her mouth fell open.</p>
<p>“Goodness, even a light touch seems to have such an effect,” he remarked.</p>
<p>Unable to contain his growing desire, Jae‐heon pulled his underwear down enough to reveal his lower half. His impressive organ now lay exposed, its robust, rod-like form moving with a surreal rhythm.</p>
<p>“Remember, I showed you how to hold and move it last time?” he said, his voice a mix of gentle instruction and desire. As he spoke, he cradled his pulsating organ tenderly, its network of veins visible—a sight that left her breathless, both by its length and its impressive girth.</p>
<p>“Now, try touching it,” he urged.</p>
