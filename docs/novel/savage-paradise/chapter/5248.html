            <p><strong>Chapter 60.1</strong></p>
<p>“It’s snowing.”</p>
<p>Just as the fireworks were coming to an end, snow began to drift outside the window.</p>
<p>It had stopped snowing earlier that evening, but now the flakes had returned. Goyo pressed close to the glass and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>“So pretty.”</p>
<p>What began as a few delicate flakes quickly turned into a flurry so thick she couldn’t see more than a step ahead. It felt as if she were standing inside the clouds themselves. Snow seemed to spill at her feet like a soft white cascade.</p>
<p>“It’s really beautiful,” she whispered.</p>
<p>Her breath fogged the glass, and she wiped it with her hand, making a gentle squeaking sound.</p>
<p>It was hard to believe the city outside was Seoul. Covered in snow, the streets looked like a foreign land. Her mind, which had been spinning, now felt calm and clear.</p>
<p>Her encounter with Kwon Moo-young, Jae-heon’s father, and Prosecutor Ma Soo-jin hadn’t felt like a coincidence.</p>
<p>There had been a flicker of concern in Kwon Moo-young’s eyes when he looked at her—and now, Ma Soo-jin’s phone number sat quietly in her bag, as if waiting.</p>
<p>This peaceful moment might just be the calm before the storm. And when it passed, she might find herself swept into something far beyond her control.</p>
<p>But for now, the beauty outside made it all feel distant.</p>
<p>“She really is… something else.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon was lounging on the sofa, tilted at an angle. He sighed, watching Goyo pressed up against the window, not budging an inch.</p>
<p>“To think I’d lose to a fireworks show…”</p>
<p>They’d been together when it started—still wrapped up in each other. But as soon as the fireworks lit up the sky, Goyo had pushed herself up and rushed to the window, entranced.</p>
<p>Being cast aside mid-moment was one thing.</p>
<p>But now it was snowing.</p>
<p>Watching her gaze at the snow, completely forgetting he was even there, Jae-heon gave a dry, amused smile.</p>
<p>A faint, airy laugh escaped him.</p>
<p>He stretched out his arms along the back of the sofa and tilted his head back.</p>
<p>“…Haah.”</p>
<p>Only one thing could understand Jae-heon’s feelings: his stubborn, unyielding erection. His cock was bobbing its head, acting up.</p>
<p>“So pretty, really pretty. Wow!”</p>
<p>Goyo paid no mind to Jae-heon’s conflicted mood, completely absorbed in the window and letting out endless admiring sounds.</p>
<p>Who could blame her? She was the one who had coaxed him here to see the night view.</p>
<p>One entire wall was a floor-to-ceiling window.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, Jae-heon’s office always boasted an incredible nightscape. It was a view he saw every day, but with fireworks and snowflakes falling, even he—usually indifferent to such things—found it unexpectedly beautiful. So of course, the young lover was utterly captivated.</p>
<p>“Jae-heon, come look. It’s so pretty.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>Just hearing his name made her smile shyly. What was that about?</p>
<p>Well, can’t be helped today.</p>
<p>‘At least she hadn’t suggested going outside for a snowball fight.’</p>
<p>‘Wait, be careful what you say—words have power. Better keep quiet. But what if she suggests building a snowman?’</p>
<p>‘Ha… I want a cigarette.’</p>
<p>The New Year’s morning dawned.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jae-heon got up late and began getting ready to go out. Goyo assumed he was going to visit his father. The day before, Kwon Moo-young had told him to come eat at the banquet hall, and Jae-heon had at least nodded absentmindedly.</p>
<p>Naturally, she expected him to go to the family home, but instead, he took her somewhere unexpected—a multiplex cinema in Samseong-dong, not far from his place.</p>
<p>They were led by an employee into the premium screening room. It was a VIP theater with private spaces, all recliner seats. Seeing that no one else was there, it seemed they had rented out the entire theater.</p>
<p>Watching staff place tea and snacks on the table, Goyo quietly asked him,</p>
<p>“Weren’t you going to your family home?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you hate movies?”</p>
<p>“Not really. But your phone keeps ringing.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s phone had been buzzing nonstop, but he deliberately ignored it. It looked like Kwon Moo-young was calling, wondering why he wasn’t coming.</p>
<p>“Is that your father? Don’t you want to answer?”</p>
<p>“Want to go to my dad’s place?” When he heard her guess, Jae-heon rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m talking about you, not me.”</p>
<p>Would she want to go to that uncomfortable, awkward place? Goyo shook her head.</p>
<p>Buzz.</p>
<p>Seeing the message on the screen, Jae-heon’s brow furrowed tightly. Muttering something like,</p>
<p>“Old man, there’ll be plenty of guests without me, so why bother calling?” he shut the phone off completely.</p>
<p>“I’m working. He’ll have to understand.”</p>
<p>“You know you’re at the cinema…”</p>
<p>“Goyo, I’m not here to have fun.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon emphasized every word with force. No matter how much she protested, he wasn’t going to turn a work trip into a pleasure trip. Goyo narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t believe me? I’m here as the investor’s rep. This is work nd this is one h*ll of an expensive movie.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon crossed his long legs, leaned back, and drummed his fingers on the armrest, grumbling. How much did he actually invest for Jae-heon to complain about the price?</p>
<p>“You don’t like movies, Jae-heon?”</p>
<p>“This kind of genre, not really.”</p>
<p>Resting one arm on the armrest and propping his chin with the other hand, Jae-heon looked indifferent. If he was here as an investor, it probably meant he couldn’t just relax and enjoy the film like a regular audience member. Especially if it wasn’t his taste, it might be a real drag.</p>
<p>“What kind of movies do you like?”</p>
<p>“Well, something simple and brainless like a hero flick. I like stories where the hero comes out and kicks the bad guy’s ass. I hate using my brain while watching movies. Why the look?”</p>
<p>“Just thought you’d like gangster films.”</p>
<p>“Gangsters actually don’t watch gangster films. It’s boring if you know it too well.”</p>
<p>He grinned mischievously and chuckled.</p>
<p>“So then, what kind of movies do you like?”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>‘What do I like?’</p>
<p>Goyo couldn’t answer right away. She hadn’t watched many movies, and above all, this was her first time coming to a movie theater.</p>
