            <p><strong>Chapter 10.1</strong></p>
<p>“So you’re saying… she’s still here?”</p>
<p>Goyo was still standing motionless at the entrance.</p>
<p>“Why? Should I call Ji Seo-hyun for you?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s voice, tinged with a smirk, was anything but kind. His broad, angular shoulders and long legs made him look like he had stepped out of a fashion magazine, but the aura he exuded was dangerously intense.</p>
<p>“You have quite a bold taste. A threes*me is your thing?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Goyo’s eyes widened at the unfamiliar word.</p>
<p>“It’s not my preference, but if you want the three of us to roll around in bed, I’ll give it a shot.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon tapped the corner of the table with his phone. He seemed ready to call Ji Seo-hyun the moment Goyo said the word.</p>
<p>“Oh, no, you misunderstand. I don’t have that kind of preference.”</p>
<p>With this man, it might not be a joke. Goyo’s hunched shoulders shrank even more.</p>
<p>Jae-heon smiled as he watched her frozen face. “I don’t think… that’s a good idea.”</p>
<p>Goyo muttered, avoiding his eyes.</p>
<p>She felt sorry for Ji Seo-hyun, but she couldn’t imagine doing anything with the three of them. The thought alone made her shudder.</p>
<p>With a clink, Jae-heon picked up his whiskey glass and slowly swirled it, looking at Goyo. The sound of the ice clinking in the glass filled the silence between them.</p>
<p>“Playing with you is difficult.”</p>
<p>The swirling glass met the man’s lips. The glass tilted, and the liquid sloshed, flowing between his lips. His prominent Adam’s apple bobbed up and down as he swallowed. The sharp taste of the whiskey made his eyes briefly wince as he looked at Goyo.</p>
<p>‘A child.’</p>
<p>Goyo silently lowered her head.</p>
<p>Her wavy hair, with thick curls, cascaded down to her waist. The ruby-colored long dress, with a high slit up to her thigh, accentuated her curves, revealing her slender legs with each step in her stiletto heels.</p>
<p>Despite her mature appearance, she couldn’t hide her inner innocence from him.</p>
<p>“I follow a fixed schedule.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon, despite his rough environment, was relatively straightforward when it came to s*x. He didn’t enjoy seeing multiple women at once or engaging in wild activities. He occasionally used women to satisfy his desires, and they were well compensated for it.</p>
<p>As long as they didn’t expect love, Kwon Jae-heon was quite a decent s*x partner.</p>
<p>“Hmm, so when something unexpected happens, it makes me angry.”</p>
<p>This year’s Christmas Eve charity event was held at the Taehan Hotel. With no plans for the next day, he had booked a suite to rest. He intended to make a brief appearance at the event and then spend the night with his partner in the suite.</p>
<p>Not much had changed, except that his partner was Lee Goyo instead of Ji Seo-hyun.</p>
<p>“If everything had gone according to schedule, I’d be deep inside by now.”</p>
<p>If he were with Ji Seo-hyun, they would have gone straight to the bedroom as soon as they entered the suite. He wouldn’t be sitting here drinking alone, trying to get a young woman to decide.</p>
<p>Propping his chin on his hand, he continued nonchalantly. Perhaps out of spite, his words came out harsh.</p>
<p>“Ji Seo-hyun gives an amazing head and is tight.”</p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun was not only stunningly beautiful but also exceptionally skilled in bed. On days when he gave her expensive gifts, her service was particularly excellent. Having spent a lot of money, tonight would have been quite satisfying. If only he hadn’t met Lee Goyo.</p>
<p>“I even went out of my way to kindly explain, which isn’t like me.”</p>
<p>Of course, there were things he didn’t explain. Like why he had changed his partner to Lee Goyo.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because he felt any special sympathy or pity for her difficult childhood. Kwon Jae-heon did not act for noble or beautiful reasons.</p>
<p>Rather, it was more about wanting to spite Lee Yi-taek, who tried to manipulate him using Lee Goyo, or Park Jung-hoon, who, despite being divorced, had the audacity to approach Lee Goyo.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it time to make a choice?”</p>
<p>By now, she should have understood what he was saying. Yet, her expression remained inscrutable. Whether she was innocent or cunning, he would find out by the end of the night.</p>
<p>“Undress or leave?”</p>
<p>He asked again.</p>
<p>Despite asking her to make a choice, it was Kwon Jae-heon who was anxious about what she might do. Although he told her to choose, he had no intention of letting her leave quietly.</p>
<p>Forcing her would be beneath him, so he waited for her to undress voluntarily. It was baffling to him that he was talking so much while being in a hotel room with a woman.</p>
