            <p><strong>Chapter 6.2</strong></p>
<p>While Lee Yoon-gun was with other women, he still kept a possessive watch over Goyo, monitoring and restricting her every move.</p>
<p>Just like now…</p>
<p>Bzzz. Her phone vibrated softly. Of course, it was Lee Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>Goyo checked her phone screen while still resting her chin on her hand.</p>
<p>[Where are you!]</p>
<p>Bzzz. Bzzz. More messages arrived before she could even reply.</p>
<p>[Are you ignoring my calls? Do you want to die, Lee Goyo??]</p>
<p>[Who are you with that you’re ignoring me?]</p>
<p>Reading his messages, which reflected his arrogant personality, made her stomach churn. They were the kind of messages you’d expect to see sent to a cheating girlfriend.</p>
<p>[I’m with the congressman. I’ll contact you later.]</p>
<p>Hoping this would keep Lee Yoon-gun off her back for a few hours, she sent the reply.</p>
<p>The only person Lee Yoon-gun truly feared was his father. Since she was there on his orders, saying she was with Lee Yi-taek wasn’t entirely a lie.</p>
<p>It worked. The barrage of messages stopped, silenced by the mention of the congressman.</p>
<p>“…A white gold chain with 400 brilliant-cut diamonds and a 0.53-carat oval-cut diamond as the center stone. This diamond necklace, totaling over 15 carats, starts at 250 million won.”</p>
<p>While checking Lee Yoon-gun’s messages, a truly extravagant item had come up for auction. What kind of woman wore something like that around her neck?</p>
<p>Goyo felt out of place and shrank into her seat. Just then, Ji Seo-hyun leaned in and whispered something into Kwon Jae-heon’s ear. Without hesitation, he bid 300 million won.</p>
<p>“As expected…”</p>
<p>A man of his caliber naturally attracted a woman like Ji Seo-hyun.</p>
<p>But was she really just a one-night stand?</p>
<p>Goyo had assumed Ji Seo-hyun was just a casual fling for Kwon Jae-heon. She had heard he changed women as easily as Lee Yoon-gun did.</p>
<p>But maybe it wasn’t just a one-night stand. It was rare for a man to give such expensive gifts to a casual fling. If they were indeed a couple, she had even less of a chance to come between them.</p>
<p>“She’s pretty.”</p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun’s bright smile, with her eyes curling up, was endearing. Goyo knew she could never make such an expression, no matter how hard she tried.</p>
<p>“Do you want that?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Are you interested in that item?”</p>
<p>She heard a man’s voice next to her but didn’t realize he was talking to her. It wasn’t until he asked again that she turned to the man sitting beside her.</p>
<p>“Now you finally look at me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She had been so focused on Kwon Jae-heon sitting in front of her that she hadn’t paid any attention to the person next to her. A handsome man was staring intently at her.</p>
<p>Who is he? He looked familiar, but she couldn’t place him.</p>
<p>“I was curious about what you were so interested in.”</p>
<p>Only then did Goyo realize she might have been staring too openly at Kwon Jae-heon. Not participating in the auction and only staring at the back of Kwon Jae-heon’s head certainly could seem odd. It might have looked suspicious.</p>
<p>“What you’re staring at… doesn’t seem to be of much interest to me.”</p>
<p>The man alternated his gaze between the necklace and Kwon Jae-heon, trying to determine what Goyo truly desired.</p>
<p>“I can’t understand why everyone is so crazy about that item.”</p>
<p>“Because it’s expensive.”</p>
<p>Both the multi-million won diamond necklace and Kwon Jae-heon with the beautiful actress by his side appeared flawless on the surface.</p>
<p>If everyone could have it, it wouldn’t be a luxury. That’s why Lee Yi-taek also coveted that man.</p>
<p>“It’s a trivial reason.”</p>
<p>There was no need to reveal her true thoughts to a stranger. Whether it was a multi-million-won necklace or a man who already had a girlfriend, she didn’t want to appear materialistic or like someone reaching beyond her means.</p>
<p>Goyo kept quiet and watched as the bids for the necklace climbed higher.</p>
<p>3.5 billion won.</p>
<p>4 billion won…</p>
<p>“The expected price was around 5 billion won, but it seems like it will go higher,” the man beside her muttered indifferently.</p>
<p>The price kept rising simply because Ji Seo-hyun wanted the necklace. No matter how much others raised the bid, Kwon Jae-heon always offered a higher amount.</p>
<p>Watching this, Goyo felt even less confident about succeeding in the task Lee Yi-taek had assigned her. This was impossible from the start.</p>
<p>“5 billion.”</p>
<p>The man who had been casually talking to Goyo suddenly joined the auction. Goyo turned her gaze to him.</p>
<p>He said he wasn’t interested in the necklace, so why?</p>
