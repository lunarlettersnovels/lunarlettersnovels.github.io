            <p><strong>Chapter 28.1</strong></p>
<p><em>“Aaargh! You f</em>cking bastard! I’ll kill you!”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun crashed onto the floor, his knee giving out beneath him. Clutching his hand in pain, he screamed at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p><em>“Tch. Even after getting his ass beat, the brat still doesn’t get it.”</em></p>
<p>Jae-heon’s gaze was ice-cold as he looked down at him.</p>
<p><em>“How many chances do I have to give you?”</em></p>
<p>His voice, detached and eerily calm, carried an unspoken warning: <em>Maybe you’ll finally learn when you’re dead.</em></p>
<p>Without hesitation, Jae-heon drove his foot into Yoon-gun’s side.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>The impact echoed sharply through the hospital room. The sound was so jarring that Goyo flinched in fear.</p>
<p><em>“Gah! Agh… ugh!”</em></p>
<p>Yoon-gun curled in on himself, gripping his ribs. His face twisted in agony, his breathing labored, his complexion turning an unnatural shade of blue. But even that seemed to irritate Jae-heon.</p>
<p><em>Thud. Thump!</em></p>
<p><em>“Keep it down. You do realize you’re disturbing the whole hospital, don’t you?”</em></p>
<p>With each dull <em>thud</em> of Jae-heon’s foot landing, Yoon-gun’s body spasmed.</p>
<p><em>“Aaagh! F-f</em>ck—” He choked and coughed violently, his voice breaking into gasps and sobs.</p>
<p><em>“Is keeping your mouth shut really that hard?”</em></p>
<p><em>Thud. Crack!</em></p>
<p>A final, brutal kick struck home. Yoon-gun coughed, his body convulsing as bright red blood spattered onto the floor.</p>
<p><em>“f</em>ck… if it were you, c-could you stay quiet—AARGH! AAAH!”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun’s cursing barely stopped between his screams.</p>
<p><em>“Why do you keep making me repeat myself?”</em></p>
<p>Jae-heon ground his boot into Yoon-gun’s wrist.</p>
<p><em>Crunch.</em></p>
<p>The sickening sound of bones shattering filled the room. Blood and saliva foamed at the corners of Yoon-gun’s mouth as his screams grew hoarse.</p>
<p><em>“Annoying.”</em></p>
<p>Jae-heon, expression unreadable, flicked the remaining length of his cigarette into the gap between his boot and Yoon-gun’s crushed hand. Then, without hesitation, he pressed down harder.</p>
<p><em>“AAAAAGH! AAGH!”</em></p>
<p>His screams tore through the air, his throat raw with agony.</p>
<p>The acrid scent of burning flesh quickly spread as Jae-heon ground the smoldering cigarette into Yoon-gun’s mangled hand. His expression remained eerily calm—unmoved by the suffering beneath him.</p>
<p>The pain was too much. Yoon-gun’s eyes rolled back, his body convulsed violently, then went limp. His muscles twitched sporadically, like a broken puppet.</p>
<p><em>“Finally, some peace and quiet.”</em></p>
<p>Jae-heon looked down at the unconscious man, foaming at the mouth, as if he were nothing more than an insect.</p>
<p>A month ago, he hadn’t gone this far.</p>
<p>Back then, Yoon-gun had been tangled up with Min Jei—a woman who had caught the eye of Kwon Moo-young in his later years. A former VIP hostess from a high-end salon in Cheongdam, she had the height and figure to match.</p>
<p>That old man hadn’t just lost his mind over her; he had set up an entire household for her, utterly obsessed. A woman with no real intellect, yet overflowing with greed.</p>
<p>She started by laundering her academic background.</p>
<p>After just six months of studying abroad, she somehow obtained a degree in Art History from a university in the U.S. It was suspicious, to say the least. But regardless of whether the diploma was real or not, Kwon Moo-young, utterly infatuated with Min Jei, handed her KJ Museum.</p>
<p>KJ Museum was primarily used for money laundering and tax evasion. The fact that his mistress wanted it and he gave it away without hesitation was a problem in itself, but more than anything, Min Jei was completely incapable of managing a museum.</p>
<p>Sitting in a position far beyond her abilities, it was only a matter of time before she became the subject of ridicule. Even having the nation’s top experts at her disposal was useless—one needs to have some knowledge to manage competent people properly. But the only skill she had was using her body to seduce men.</p>
<p>More than anything, she overstepped her place and meddled in Kwon Jae-heon’s affairs. Though it wasn’t enough to cause him any real damage, it was an irritation.</p>
<p>Even if she had chosen an old man for his wealth, how long could a woman with an insatiable s*x drive endure? He had merely watched, knowing the answer. Sure enough, less than a year passed before everything fell apart.</p>
<p>“Drag those bastards in here right now!”</p>
<p>When the old man found out his mistress had gone on a romantic getaway with a man younger than his own son, he completely lost it. He was so furious that it seemed as if a blood vessel might burst.</p>
<p>He had given her everything—his liver, his gallbladder—and in return, she had betrayed him.</p>
<p>Swinging a golf club in a rage, he threatened to go after them himself if no one acted fast. In the end, Jae-heon had to drop everything, including a contract that only needed his signature, and rush down to Cheongdo.</p>
<p>The moment he saw the two rolling around on the living room floor—not even in the bedroom—his temper flared. Delaying a hundred-billion-won deal for scum like this? It was infuriating.</p>
<p>So, Jae-heon decided to beat the hell out of Lee Yoon-gun for the crime of pissing him off. It didn’t matter if the man was a law student or the son of a National Assembly member.</p>
