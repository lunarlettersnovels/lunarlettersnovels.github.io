            <p><strong>Chapter 11.2</strong></p>
<p>Goyo didn’t want to end up as just a one-night stand.</p>
<p>She expected too much from a man who could easily discard a lover who gave him expensive gifts. She had chased after him with a purpose, yet she had calculated so much in such a short time.</p>
<p>Spending just one night with Kwon Jae-heon would give her something to report to Lee Yi-taek, but she had overthought it. If he gave her another task afterward… she would think about that then.</p>
<p>“In the end, it will be a meaningless night.”</p>
<p>Goyo had led the situation to this point. Yet, the reason Jae-heon’s remark about it being just a one-night stand stung was probably because this night was her first. She had hoped that her first experience, if not with love, would at least be with someone she liked.</p>
<p>In truth, Goyo had always known it would end up like this.</p>
<p>Her first time was simply a gift that Lee Yi-taek was sending to someone. Lee Yi-taek’s gift to Kwon Jae-heon was just a bribe, nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>“Playtime with you is over.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s tone indicated that he wouldn’t tolerate any more games as he reached out towards her. As Jae-heon raised his arm, Goyo squeezed her eyes shut. Her neck shrank back, and her fingers trembled as she gripped her arms.</p>
<p>When a large male hand approached her, Goyo’s body instinctively reacted. The violence inflicted on her since childhood was etched into her body and mind.</p>
<p>Her heart pounded wildly, and her vision went white. Her face and even her neck turned red, and her breathing became rough.</p>
<p>She braced herself, teeth clenched, for the blow that was about to come, but no impact followed. Instead, a light chuckle fell over her head.</p>
<p>Goyo struggled to lift her eyelids as if they were weighed down by a thousand-pound rock, to see what was happening.</p>
<p>Jae-heon had stretched his long arm to grasp the doorknob behind her. He looked at her, huddled and pale, with an expression of disbelief.</p>
<p>“Are you scared of me?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon let go of the doorknob and let out a dry laugh.</p>
<p>Goyo could barely breathe as she looked at him. The fear that had wrapped around her hadn’t completely dissipated, and her eyelashes trembled uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Jae-heon shook his head and bent down to meet Goyo’s eyes.</p>
<p>“You provoked me, yet you’re scared?”</p>
<p>“That’s not it.”</p>
<p>Goyo avoided Jae-heon’s gaze and lowered her head. She wetted her parched lips and swallowed repeatedly, trying to catch her breath.</p>
<p>The memory of Kwon Jae-heon beating the delinquent Lee Yoon-gun within an inch of his life was still vivid in her mind, but the fear she felt now wasn’t entirely due to that memory.</p>
<p>That didn’t mean she underestimated this man. He might even be scarier than Lee Yi-taek.</p>
<p>“If I had told you to leave, would you have gone?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Could she really have turned back? Even if she ran from Kwon Jae-heon, she would only return to a world ruled by Lee Yi-taek and Lee Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>She said it, but suddenly, Goyo thought that maybe dying here would be better.</p>
<p>“Lying will get you punished.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon grasped her chin with his long fingers and lifted it. Their eyes met. His eyes gleamed sharply, like a predator that had found its prey. Her whole body tingled as if electricity were coursing through her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, President Kwon.”</p>
<p>“You were playing with me.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s languid voice wrapped around her ears. His slow, drawling tone sounded strangely decadent and sensual. The sudden change in his demeanor sent shivers down her spine.</p>
<p>“What? Oh, is that your brother calling you?”</p>
<p>Goyo’s expression, which had been like a mask, cracked. She looked at Jae-heon in a daze, not sensing her cellphone’s persistent vibration.</p>
<p>Seeing her bewildered face, Jae-heon’s lips curled up into a smile.</p>
<p>He found it amusing. He didn’t want to hear “President Kwon” even in the bedroom. And besides…</p>
<p>“I don’t like reusing my things.”</p>
<p>His low voice, coupled with hot breath, whispered into her ear, sending shivers down her spine.</p>
<p>“…You’re quite a nuisance.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Jae-heon’s gaze shifted to her hand. The persistent vibration coming from the bag she clutched as if her life depended on it was grating on his nerves.</p>
