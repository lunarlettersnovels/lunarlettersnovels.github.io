            <p><strong>Chapter 20.2</strong></p>
<p>They say the memory of a first experience lingers long. Perhaps, when the marks of desire etched on her body and the lingering pain faded, she could forget.</p>
<p>Bzzz-bzzz.</p>
<p>A bittersweet expression crossed Goyo’s face.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>The vibrating phone yanked her back to reality. The presence of Yoon-gun, momentarily forgotten in the aftermath of her first encounter, now poured cold water over her heated body.</p>
<p>Unlike Jae-heon, whom she could avoid, Yoon-gun…</p>
<p>“…I hate this.”</p>
<p>Why was he acting like a jealous husband?</p>
<p>Bzzz-bzzz.</p>
<p>Surely, he hadn’t been calling non-stop for hours?</p>
<p>“No way…”</p>
<p>Goyo crouched by the entrance, rummaging through her bag for her phone.</p>
<p>“Oh, wow.”</p>
<p>Seeing the screen, she couldn’t help but laugh incredulously.</p>
<p>Yoon-gun, 99 missed calls.</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes with the back of her hand, but the number on the screen remained unchanged. Even a husband confronting an unfaithful wife wouldn’t go this far.</p>
<p>Buzz, buzz.</p>
<p>If she didn’t answer, messages would arrive relentlessly. Goyo felt suffocated by Yoon-gun’s unyielding persistence. She couldn’t understand why he was so obsessed with her.</p>
<p>It’s not like he doesn’t have a girlfriend. Why doesn’t he focus on her?</p>
<p>[Goyo, you need to answer the phone. Goyo, what are you doing not answering? Lee Goyo, I won’t be mad, just pick up. Lee Goyo!!]</p>
<p>[Lee Goyo, answer the phone. I said I wouldn’t be mad. Answer the phone!!!]</p>
<p>[Are you ignoring me? Do you want to die, Lee Goyo?? Do you need a beating to come to your senses!!!!]</p>
<p>Someone must have told Yoon-gun that she went up to a hotel with another man. Otherwise, there was no explaining his frantic attempts to reach her. Although he often called and messaged repeatedly if he couldn’t reach her, this was unprecedented.</p>
<p>[You b!tch, answer the phone if you don’t want to die! Answer!!!!!]</p>
<p>He resorted to vulgar insults without hesitation.</p>
<p>Even if he liked her, his behavior was enough to drive anyone away, especially given their strained relationship.</p>
<p>Buzz, buzz.</p>
<p>While reading the messages, her phone buzzed again.</p>
<p>Of course, it was Yoon-gun. She was sick of it.</p>
<p>The brief peace she’d found with Jae-heon was shattered. Though her body was exhausted, it was preferable to the psychological torment she was now enduring.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Goyo held her phone tightly, biting her lower lip. Ignoring him might be better, but it could cause more trouble later. She couldn’t avoid him indefinitely, especially since they were bound to run into each other soon.</p>
<p>She exhaled softly and pressed the call button.</p>
<p>“Damn it. Lee Goyo! Where are you?”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun’s voice, filled with rage, came through the phone the moment the call connected. His immediate outburst made Goyo wince, pulling the phone away from her ear.</p>
<p>“You deliberately didn’t answer my calls, did you? Damn it, say something!”</p>
<p>Even without holding the phone to her ear, Yoon-gun’s loud voice came through clearly from the tiny speaker.</p>
<p>“It’s cold.”</p>
<p>Goyo sighed as she stared at her phone.</p>
<p>The chill from the marble floor seeped into her bare feet. It hadn’t felt this cold when she was with Jae-heon. She pulled the sheet tighter around her and shivered.</p>
<p>‘At least during s*x…’</p>
<p>While with Jae-heon, Yoon-gun never crossed her mind. Yoon-gun’s constant badgering was unbearable, but the intensity of her time with Jae-heon had pushed all thoughts of Yoon-gun away.</p>
<p>“Hey, you… Damn it.”</p>
<p>Yoon-gun’s ranting was best ignored for her sanity.</p>
<p>Goyo placed her phone on the floor. Still crouching, she covered her ears with her hands like a child, blocking out the noise.</p>
<p>‘I can’t hear anything. I can’t hear a thing.’</p>
<p>She gazed at the ceiling through half-closed eyes, waiting for Yoon-gun’s tirade to end.</p>
<p>“He sounds like a whining child.”</p>
<p>A soft voice came from the direction of the living room. Startled, Goyo quickly turned her head toward the voice.</p>
