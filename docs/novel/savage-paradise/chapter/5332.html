            <p>Jae-heon muttered while rolling her protruding clitoris with the tip of his tongue. Each word he spoke sent hot breath against her delicate flesh, stimulating her further.</p>
<p>Jae-heon moved his tongue to lick up the entrance, then sucked on the erect clitoris. Every time his wet tongue rubbed against her, a tingling sensation spread from her head to her toes.</p>
<p>“Aah.”</p>
<p>Fluid flowed from the split opening. Jae-heon pressed his lips close to the hole and sucked hard enough to make a slurping sound. The stimulated opening released more fluid.</p>
<p>“You’re sensitive. Just my tongue touching it, and your pus<em>y is dripping. Imagine what will happen when my c</em>ck goes in, right?”</p>
<p>“Don’t… say things like that… ah, oh…”</p>
<p>The intense stimulation was overwhelming, making Goyo twist her waist, but he continued to suck greedily. The lewd sounds of her never-before-touched pus*y being sucked echoed in her ears.</p>
<p>“Mm, uh… ah.”</p>
<p>“So sweet. Why are you so sweet?”</p>
<p>He rolled his tongue into a point and thrust it deep inside her. His nose buried in the soft hairs, and he continuously probed the hole with his tongue.</p>
<p>“Aah, aaah… uh, ah.”</p>
<p>Goyo arched her back like a fish caught on a spear. Jae-heon held her down firmly, sucking on her clitoris and labia. It felt as though he was about to pull her flesh into his mouth. The overwhelming sensations from her lower body made her unable to hold back her cries.</p>
<p>“Ha, haa. Stop, please… ah.”</p>
<p>Finally, his tongue moved to her back hole. His wet tongue relentlessly licked the soft folds of her perineum. The tingling sensation rising from her toes made Goyo cry out and twist her body in spasms.</p>
<p>“W-wait, uh, it’s dir… oh, ah.”</p>
<p>He slowly rubbed the perineum with his fingertips, then pressed down hard. The tight interior resisted, barely allowing a finger to penetrate. Meanwhile, his tongue didn’t stop moving. His finger was in her anus, and his tongue was exploring her.</p>
<p>“P-please, uh, stop… uh.”</p>
<p>Goyo clutched the sheets, tears welling up. The unfamiliar stimulation overwhelmed her senses. The tingling made her toes curl and her back arch. The intense sensations brought tears to her eyes.</p>
<p>“…Damn, I’m going crazy.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon lifted his head, licking his lips. Seeing her pus*y convulsing and leaking juices, he couldn’t hold back any longer. He had reached his limit.</p>
<p>He tore open the condom packet with his teeth and unrolled it over his swollen, veiny manhood. The transparent rubber stretched taut over his engorged member.</p>
<p>“W-wait a moment.”</p>
<p>Seeing the massive erection, Goyo instinctively shook her head and tried to back away. It was too large. The idea of such a huge object entering her body seemed like torture. It didn’t even seem possible for it to fit inside her small opening.</p>
<p>“I-it won’t fit…”</p>
<p>“Where do you think you’re going?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon pulled her flailing legs back and positioned himself between them. He spread her thighs with his knees and aimed his erection at her delicate entrance. The tip of his glasses pressed firmly against her opening.</p>
<p>“Haa, it won’t go in… ah!”</p>
<p>“Yes, it will.”</p>
<p>Despite thinking she was sufficiently lubricated, the narrowness of her inner walls made it difficult to penetrate in one go. Only the large head managed to push in before being forced out by the tightness. Jae-heon’s c*ck was ruthlessly large, and her insides were too tight to accommodate his massive size.</p>
<p>“Too… tight.”</p>
<p>“No, please, ah, uh…”</p>
<p>Goyo clung to the sheets, shaking her head repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Damn it.”</p>
<p>Frustrated by the resistance, Jae-heon cursed under his breath and applied more force. After several attempts, the glans finally breached her labia properly.</p>
<p>The pain from the thick tip forcefully pushing in was beyond imagination. The intense pain felt like her body was being split in two, causing Goyo’s mouth to open involuntarily. The agony was so severe that she couldn’t even scream; her vision went white, and her breath caught in her throat.</p>
<p>Her face turned pale, and cold sweat trickled down her skin.</p>
<p>“Goyo?”</p>
<p>“…Gasp, uh.”</p>
<p>“Goyo, stay with me.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon gently tapped her cheek as Goyo gasped for air with her mouth open.</p>
<p>“Breathe and look at me.”</p>
<p>“…Gasp, gasp.”</p>
<p>Her eyes, wide open, were filled with pain. Her eyelashes trembled as tears welled up and rolled down her cheeks. The flesh shaft buried inside her tightened vag*na twitched, oblivious to the situation.</p>
<p>“…Ha, ugh.”</p>
<p>“Goyo, calm down and follow me. Inhale, exhale.”</p>
<p>Despite the rough circumstances below, Jae-heon started to soothe Goyo gently.</p>
<p>“Hoo, gasp, gasp.”</p>
<p>“Good girl. That’s it… you’re doing well.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon was in a dilemma. Not only was he unable to thrust properly, but he hadn’t even fully inserted his, and she was already gasping for breath. He had only pushed the head in, yet her body had tensed up so much that further penetration seemed nearly impossible.</p>
<p>“Hah, I didn’t think I’d have to teach you how to breathe.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon sighed deeply, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he lowered his eyes. Despite his slow, deliberate speech, the situation below was growing increasingly dire. The half-inserted shaft was swelling, causing the point of connection to stretch painfully tight.</p>
<p>Realizing this couldn’t go on, Jae-heon leaned down and pressed his lips to Goyo’s. He kissed her gently while gradually pushing himself further in.</p>
<p>“Ah, ahh.”</p>
<p>“It’s almost in. Just hang on a little longer, okay?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, uh…”</p>
<p>The thickness and length seemed endless, making it feel like the pain would never cease. As the sensation of tearing flesh persisted, Goyo struggled and squirmed.</p>
<p>“Ugh, please, stop… ah…”</p>
<p>Goyo bit her lip and trembled, tears streaming down her cheeks and soaking her face.</p>
<p>“No one’s stopping now.”</p>
<p>“It hurts…”</p>
<p>“Try to relax, okay?”</p>
<p>Jae-heon met her eyes gently, trying to soothe her pain. But even in his voice, the strain was evident, his patience wearing thin.</p>
