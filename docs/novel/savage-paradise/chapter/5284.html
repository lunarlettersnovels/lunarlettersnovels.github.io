            <p><strong>Chapter 41.2</strong></p>
<p>Goyo cautiously cupped the striking form with her hand. She moistened her palm with the sticky fluid that had escaped from the opening, massaging its tip in a deliberate, measured way. She could feel its steady, robust pulsation beneath her palm.</p>
<p>“Now, stick out your tongue,” he whispered seductively, his eyes lowered suggestively.</p>
<p>“Begin by gently licking around the sensitive area,” he added.</p>
<p>Following his instruction, Goyo extended her tongue and tentatively licked along his scrotal area, slowly moving upward along his length. Though her movements were a bit awkward, his engorged organ responded with a slight, approving twitch. Carefully, she pressed her tongue against the opening, tasting the slightly tangy, subtly salty fluid that coated it, and her mouth began to water.</p>
<p>A soft exhalation escaped him as his organ twitched with renewed vigor and then stiffened.</p>
<p>“That’s it… just like that,” he murmured with a light moan. Thick, dark veins became visible along his engorged shaft.</p>
<p>“Now, please, use your lips,” he urged gently.</p>
<p>Seeing his member growing larger before they’d even really begun made her jaw feel strained. It was so big that it nearly overwhelmed her mouth. Tentatively, she extended her tongue to gently touch its tip and, summoning her courage, took it in. Unsure if she was being too rough, she stole a quick glance at Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“That’s it… good job,” he murmured.</p>
<p>Between each breath, Goyo opened her mouth wider, slowly taking him in bit by bit. The soft flesh brushed against her teeth as it entered, and even though she hadn’t taken much at once, her jaw began to feel overstrained.</p>
<p>“Just… a little more, please,” she gasped.</p>
<p>The tip slipped past her soft palate, sliding deeper into her throat.</p>
<p>Struggling to breathe, Goyo’s throat contracted around him as his presence filled the narrow space, setting off her gag reflex. Her body shuddered, and each involuntary heave brought soft, physiological tears that trickled down her cheeks while her face grew increasingly pale.</p>
<p>Between labored breaths—“Ah, ah… mm, mmm”—her eyes reddened and saliva kept escaping her lips.</p>
<p>She couldn’t think straight. Overwhelmed by the firm, filling sensation in her throat, she could only alternate between gentle sucking and swallowing the accumulating saliva.</p>
<p>“…Haa,” she panted.</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s hand slid around to the back of her head, lightly gripping her hair. Before she could even register the pull, he gave her head a slight shake. The engorged length that filled her mouth then began to move deeper, beyond her soft palate.</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh,” he murmured.</p>
<p>Even as she continued to struggle, he did not relent. Pushing deeper, then retracting slightly, his member brushed against her teeth. She could feel the subtle pulsation along its surface as it slid between them.</p>
<p>“Damn, this is driving me crazy. Ha…”</p>
<p>Jae-heon let out a strained curse, his breath heavy with tension.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Saliva mixed with a faintly briny taste continuously trickled down her throat.</p>
<p>Goyo, trying to clear her airway, bit down—not harshly, but firmly.</p>
<p>“Hah… ugh.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon trembled, letting out a pained sound. Only then did Goyo, sensing something unusual, lift her gaze to look at him.</p>
<p>“C-Chief…?”</p>
<p>She blinked, her teeth still clamped tightly around his throbbing length, veins visibly strained.</p>
<p>“Hah… no matter how good it is… biting isn’t…”</p>
<p>Through his fingers pressed against his forehead, Jae-heon’s distorted expression peeked through.</p>
<p>As Goyo lifted her head, he slid free from her mouth, revealing deep red bite marks along his skin.</p>
<p>“…When I said to be gentle, I didn’t mean to take a piece off.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon’s low, cool voice struck Goyo’s ear. It must have stung, as she bit down on her lower lip and let out a slow breath.</p>
<p>“…You can’t return something just because it’s damaged. You’re the one who broke it.”</p>
<p>“Is it not working?”</p>
<p>Goyo mumbled as she tried to sit up, but Jae-heon pressed down firmly on her head, keeping her in place.</p>
<p>“That’s what you’re worried about?”</p>
<p>A low chuckle, laced with amusement, escaped him.</p>
<p>“Well, the bite marks are clear… but it’s not a problem.”</p>
<p>His grip on her head tightened.</p>
<p>“A little dent doesn’t mean it’s useless. I’ll take it out and show you.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon pressed himself against her lips, parting them as he pushed forward. A deep, masculine scent filled her senses.</p>
