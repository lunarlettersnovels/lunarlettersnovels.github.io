            <p><strong>Chapter 49.1</strong></p>
<p>“What can’t a man do when he’s head over heels for a woman?”</p>
<p>“My daughter is not just a one-night stand, is she?”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek’s expression was shamelessly calm, as if he were a sly fox.</p>
<p>He had sent her all dressed up to his taste from head to toe. Lee Yi-taek must have anticipated from the very beginning that Jae-heon would take Goyo into his arms.</p>
<p>“You knew what you were doing, didn’t you?” Jae-heon looked at Lee Yi-taek intently in the eye.</p>
<p>“That’s troublesome.”</p>
<p>“Who knows? I might just grant you what you desire, Congressman.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon stared intently at the framed picture hanging on the wall of Lee Yi-taek’s office.</p>
<p>[天下我足下, 我獨尊]</p>
<p>“The world is beneath my feet; I alone am respected.”</p>
<p>To say he would place the world beneath his feet was an incredibly arrogant statement.</p>
<p>Even a single frame hanging on the wall revealed his ambition to become the highest ruler of this country. Whether he would achieve that desire or be ruined by it remained to be seen.</p>
<p>Having gone through the position of deputy prosecutor to become a three-term congressman, Lee Yi-taek viewed Kwon Jae-heon merely as an unwelcome thug. If he set his mind to it, he could use Goyo as bait to turn Park Jeong-hoon of Seongjo Daily into his pawn, or he could pull Han Yoon-woo, the son of the current Speaker of the National Assembly and a freshman congressman, to his side.</p>
<p>However, Lee Yi-taek was a man who prioritized profit over personal feelings.</p>
<p>“Please tell me what you want, Congressman.”</p>
<p>“What does Director Kwon have to be so confident about?”</p>
<p>While saying that, Lee Yi-taek was inwardly contemplating what he could gain. He was the type of person who, when given one thing, would not be satisfied and would ask for more.</p>
<p>He was a wicked man reminiscent of a snake.</p>
<p>Beeep—Beeep—.</p>
<p>As serious discussions were taking place between Lee Yi-taek and Jae-heon, Jae-heon’s phone rang. He looked at the screen to check the caller ID.</p>
<p>‘Do I still have business to attend to?’</p>
<p>It was Park Seo-hwa from Seongjo Daily.</p>
<p>Beeep—Beeep—.</p>
<p>The expression on Kwon Jae-heon’s face subtly hardened as he stared at the ringing phone.</p>
<p>He had no personal relationship with Park Seo-hwa to exchange calls. If it was about the article from a few days ago, the matter should have already been settled. Jae-heon tilted his head slightly and pressed the call button.</p>
<p>Seeing Jae-heon attempt to take the call without seeking his consent, Lee Yi-taek was taken aback.</p>
<p>“Are you joking with me, Director Kwon? Right now…”</p>
<p>“Just a moment, Congressman.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon spread his palm to interrupt Lee Yi-taek’s words.</p>
<p>He believed it was polite to ask for the other party’s consent when receiving a call during a conversation. However, Jae-heon had no intention of being courteous to Lee Yi-taek from the start.</p>
<p>It was Lee Yi-taek who was at a disadvantage, not him.</p>
<p>“Hello…? Huh? What…? Oh no.”</p>
<p>Jae-heon furrowed his brows as he looked at the call that had ended without him saying a word.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>December 31st, 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Cheongdam J.</p>
<p>[I’m in a meeting now. Have you arrived?]</p>
<p>When Goyo arrived at the famous beauty salon Cheongdam J for her makeup and hair, Kwon Jae-heon’s message arrived as if he had been waiting.</p>
<p>[Yes, I just arrived.]</p>
<p>As she sent her reply, Goyo sat down on the sofa in the waiting room.</p>
<p>[I told Director Jeong to pay special attention to you, but I wonder if you’ll like it.]</p>
<p>“…There’s no way I won’t like it.”</p>
<p>In fact, it was a bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>Cheongdam J was a beauty salon frequented only by the upper class and top stars. It operated on a membership basis and was rumored to provide the best service suitable for the top 1%.</p>
<p>In particular, Director Jeong of Cheongdam J was famous for refusing clients who did not meet his standards. If it weren’t for Kwon Jae-heon, Goyo would never have set foot in this place.</p>
<p>Although she was sitting in the waiting room with time left before her appointment, the luxurious interior kept her from getting bored as she admired her surroundings.</p>
<p>[I’ll finish quickly and come over.]</p>
<p>[I’ll take longer than expected. You can take your time.]</p>
<p>[I just like being with you more. I’ll wrap things up quickly.]</p>
<p>Women’s preparation time takes much longer than men can imagine. Arriving early and waiting can be quite a trial.</p>
<p>[It’s snowing, so take your time coming.] She replied back.</p>
<p>[Are you worried about me right now? How sweet.]</p>
<p>“Am I worried?”</p>
<p>When she left Jae-heon’s house, the sky had seemed overcast, but soon, a few snowflakes began to flutter down. By the time she arrived at Cheongdam J, the snow had turned into larger flakes swirling around. Even though Jae-heon’s house was also in Cheongdam, it wasn’t far, yet it still took a while to get there.</p>
<p>[It’s only natural to worry.]</p>
<p>[That’s nice. It’s good to have someone who worries about me. ^^♡]</p>
<p>“Ha, a heart? …Was he this kind of person?”</p>
