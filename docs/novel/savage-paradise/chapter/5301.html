            <p><strong>Chapter 33.1</strong></p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon, are you threatening Lee Goyo right now?”</p>
<p>The situation was becoming strange, so Park Jung-hoon intervened. The woman had come to see him, and he was having a hard time because of this unexpected guest.</p>
<p>“You may be a thug, but you don’t touch women and children.”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon glared at Kwon Jae-heon with a shocked and scolding gaze.</p>
<p>“Did you… did you hit Lee Goyo? Is that why her face is bruised?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon didn’t seem to think it was worth responding to, so he didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>It was clear that Park Jung-hoon was trying to scold him, but it sounded more like he was trying to calm him down. It wasn’t a threat, but rather a warning.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t the CEO,” Goyo said.</p>
<p>Since Park Jung-hoon hadn’t looked at her face strangely until now, she thought he hadn’t noticed the bruises. But it seemed he had been pretending not to know.</p>
<p>Goyo quickly explained, not wanting him to misunderstand.</p>
<p>“Then who did it?”</p>
<p>“Door,” she replied.</p>
<p>“Door? The one that opens and closes?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon looked at her with a questioning expression, and Goyo let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“I’m a bit clumsy, so I bumped into a door.”</p>
<p>“What kind of door do you bump into to get a face like that?</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon was bothered by Goyo’s bruises. It were mostly covered with makeup, but the swelling couldn’t be completely hidden.</p>
<p>Her face had been fine until Friday evening. The last person she was with that day was Kwon Jae-heon. There were rumors about young men who roughly handled women at night, but he hadn’t heard anything like that about Kwon Jae-heon, which made him curious.</p>
<p>It turned out that there were rumors about Lee Yoon-gun’s bad temper. Park Jung-hoon narrowed his eyes and asked.</p>
<p>“Is it Lee Yoon-gun?”</p>
<p>As soon as Lee Yoon-gun’s name was mentioned, the color drained from Goyo’s face. It was clear that the bruises on her face were related to him, even without asking further questions.</p>
<p>“So, the Han-young Hospital assault incident… was it about this?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon looked at Kwon Jae-heon with an incredulous expression.</p>
<p>So, Kwon Jae-heon had beaten Lee Yoon-gun?</p>
<p>There had been a tip about an assault at Han-young Hospital, and surprisingly, the main characters were Kwon Jae-heon and Lee Yoon-gun.</p>
<p>It was hard to understand why the two men, who didn’t seem to have any connection, would fight, but if Goyo was involved, it made sense.</p>
<p>“A few punches, what’s the big deal?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon seemed to think that way.</p>
<p>He had hit the guy to make him come to his senses. His temper was bad, so he broke his wrist and burned him with a cigarette. He had also stepped on his naked body, leaving bruises all over.</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon had shown unexpected leniency. The wrist wasn’t severed, so a few months of casting would allow him to return to his daily life without issues.</p>
<p>Although his body was covered in bruises, aside from the rib fracture, they wouldn’t be noticeable outside, and he could still engage in external activities.</p>
<p>“What do you mean a few punches? You almost killed him. If Congressman Lee presses charges, you’ll be arrested right away.”</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to being arrested, is that what you’re trying to say?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon shouted in a voice mixed with irritation.</p>
<p>Until now, the women who had a one-night stand with Kwon Jae-heon had always been treated like leftovers. He thought Goyo would be no different.</p>
<p>He had planned to comfort Goyo, whom he assumed would be hurt, and appeal to her with his charm. That’s why he had carefully arranged this meeting to cater to Lee Yi-taek’s whims.</p>
<p>But then Kwon Jae-heon appeared. He must have come to interfere, thinking Park Jung-hoon was trying to steal Goyo away.</p>
<p>Anyway, Kwon Jae-heon was a nuisance in many ways. He was a thug who did loan sharking, and he kept getting in the way.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who blew this out of proportion, Park Jung-hoon.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t do anything!”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon’s mocking tone always made Park Jung-hoon angry. He had always been a troublesome guy, from the past to the present.</p>
<p>“You’re not asking because you don’t know, are you?”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon showed a nonchalant expression, as if Park Jung-hoon’s anger was no big deal.</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon seemed unaware that Lee Yi-taek didn’t care about Lee Yoon-gun’s condition. He was a great man who wouldn’t bat an eye even if his own child died, as long as it was for his own benefit.</p>
<p>Instead, this incident had given Lee Yi-taek an excuse to make unreasonable demands on Kwon Jae-heon. Of course, Kwon Jae-heon had done it willingly, but as a result, it was a welcome development for Lee Yi-taek. He could now get even more from Kwon Jae-heon.</p>
<p>“Sungjo Daily’s social news headline. It’s your work, isn’t it, Director Park?”</p>
