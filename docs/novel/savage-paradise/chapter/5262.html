            <p><strong>Chapter 52.2</strong></p>
<p>The political funds politicians could use legally were just the tip of the iceberg compared to what was actually spent. Lee Yi-taek had even put Goyo up as collateral, so the amount of money he planned to wring out of Jae-heon was likely beyond imagination.</p>
<p>This is why he had tried to avoid getting involved with politicians.</p>
<p>“Young people are great to do business with. We speak the same language.”</p>
<p>Lee Yi-taek wiped the unpleasant expression from his face and smiled faintly in an instant, looking like an actor in a Chinese opera.</p>
<p>December 31st, 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Cheongdam J.</p>
<p>“Kwon, clingy men aren’t attractive.”</p>
<p>Goyo and Park Seo-hwa were sitting side by side getting their makeup done when Kwon Jae-heon suddenly showed up. Seeing him, Park Seo-hwa curled her lips into a mocking smile.</p>
<p>“No need to worry—I have no reason to cling to you, Ms. Park.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, I’m not into younger men anyway.”</p>
<p>Just imagining it seemed repulsive to Park Seo-hwa, as she furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>“Goyo, have you heard of a magazine called Women’s Life?”</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, Park Seo-hwa looked at Goyo’s reflection in the large mirror and asked. Goyo shook her head silently.</p>
<p>“It’s out of print now, so a pretty young thing like you might not know it. It was a monthly magazine we published at Seongjo. Anyway, my point is—I’ve interviewed so many women and heard all kinds of stories, and I can tell you, when men are like that from the start of a relationship, they develop morbid jealousy later on.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yup. One hundred percent. So let me give you some advice: both Jung-hoon and Mr. Kwon here are bad news. Goyo, just come to me. I’ll treat you like a queen.”</p>
<p>Park Seo-hwa winked and whispered.</p>
<p>“Ms. Park!”</p>
<p>Whether he heard her or not, Kwon Jae-heon growled from behind.</p>
<p>“Mr. Kwon, stop butting into girl talk and go hit a sauna or something. This will take at least two more hours, so don’t get in the way. Oh my! Did you just frown at me? Careful, you’ll get wrinkles. You already have quite the age gap with Goyo—I heard it’s significant. Add wrinkles to that, and who’ll think you’re lovers? You’ll look like father and daughter. Ho ho.”</p>
<p>Goyo found Park Seo-hwa’s boldness refreshing. Who else would dare talk to Kwon Jae-heon like that? It was impressive.</p>
<p>But Kwon Jae-heon didn’t back down either. He dragged a chair over and sat right behind them. Park Seo-hwa shot him a sharp glare through narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“Please, do continue, Ms. Park.”</p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon shrugged, crossed his arms and legs, and sat there watching them.</p>
<p>For the entire two hours.</p>
<p>His reflection remained clearly visible in the large mirror on the wall. Goyo felt increasingly uneasy with him looming like a statue behind her. Even Park Seo-hwa—who claimed she couldn’t stand even having bodyguards around—was clearly fed up.</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>Eventually, Park Seo-hwa clicked her tongue.</p>
<p>“Goyo, seriously reconsider this relationship. Kwon’s the type to smother people to death. Honestly, Park Jung-hoon is better. He’s not this intense. Yeah, actually, date my younger brother. A guy with flowers in his head is better than a guy with pathological jealousy.”</p>
<p>…she whispered like a ventriloquist, leaning toward Goyo.</p>
<p>“You know, I say this because you’re like a daughter to me. If I hadn’t messed up my first love, I might’ve had a daughter like you.”</p>
<p>“Huh? How old are you, if you don’t mind me asking…?”</p>
<p>She looked barely in her early thirties. At most, maybe mid-thirties, being Park Jung-hoon’s older sister. But to have had a daughter Goyo’s age?</p>
<p>“Me? I’m twenty years older than you.”</p>
<p>“No way…”</p>
<p>Goyo gaped in shock. No wonder Park Jung-hoon seemed so intimidated by her—their age gap must be significant.</p>
<p>“So treat me like an aunt, if not your mom. Feel free to reach out if anything happens. I can protect you up to a point—from both Jung-hoon and that crazy… I mean, Mr. Kwon.”</p>
<p>Since they were whispering quietly so Kwon Jae-heon couldn’t hear them, he frowned and stared at their reflection in the mirror. He probably thought they were badmouthing him.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Goyo meant it from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>There was no malice in Park Seo-hwa’s gaze. It wasn’t the look of someone seeing a parasite clinging to Yi-taek for survival or a gold digger trying to seduce rich men for a life upgrade.</p>
<p>She was genuinely concerned for Goyo. It was the first time Goyo had ever received such warm attention from anyone, and the entire conversation left her with a strange, lingering feeling.</p>
