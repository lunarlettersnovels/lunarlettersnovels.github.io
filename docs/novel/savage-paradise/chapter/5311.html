            <p><strong>Chapter 27.2</strong></p>
<p>Goyo envied the nameless woman who had vanished without a trace. After all, the person who most wanted to escape this situation was her.</p>
<p><em>“f</em>ck, why the hell are you here?!”</p>
<p>Lee Yoon-gun’s furious roar made Goyo feel like her eardrums would burst. Kwon Jae-heon also frowned, seemingly annoyed by the noise, but that was all.</p>
<p><em>“If you’re asking why I’m here.”</em></p>
<p>Kwon Jae-heon lazily spoke as he pulled out a cigarette from its pack.</p>
<p><em>“Let’s just say I’m here to visit a patient.”</em></p>
<p>Was this what they called giving the poison and the cure? Jae-heon acted as if he had no idea who was responsible for Lee Yoon-gun being hospitalized in the first place.</p>
<p><em>“Y-you! Do you even know where you are?!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Not exactly a restricted area.”</em></p>
<p>Jae-heon placed the cigarette between his lips.</p>
<p>A metallic <em>clink</em> sounded as he flicked open his lighter. He tilted his head slightly, and the flame caught, lighting the tip of his cigarette.</p>
<p>Clearly, basic rules like indoor smoking bans in public buildings meant nothing to him. Come to think of it, he had smoked just as casually in resorts and hotel rooms before.</p>
<p><em>“Terrible hospitality. And in front of your grown little sister, no less—your outfit is far too… casual.”</em></p>
<p>What truly irritated him wasn’t anything else—it was Yoon-gun’s naked body. His still-erect cock, unsatisfied and stiff, made the whole scene even more revolting.</p>
<p>Getting hard while hitting your own sister? What kind of animal…?</p>
<p><em>“Who the hell said you were a guest?!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Trust me, I didn’t want to come either.”</em></p>
<p>Jae-heon glanced behind him before stepping into the hospital room, pulling the door shut behind him. <em>Thud.</em> The heavy door closed with a dull sound.</p>
<p><em>“Wouldn’t have had to if someone hadn’t run away while I was asleep.”</em></p>
<p>His gaze landed on Goyo.</p>
<p>Her hair, tangled from Yoon-gun’s grip, was a mess. Her cheek was swollen and red, with a dark bruise forming beneath the surface. It was a stark contrast from the last image Jae-heon had of her—just hours ago, she’d been the woman he’d kissed and held all night. Now, she was barely recognizable.</p>
<p><em>“It was you, wasn’t it?! Kwon Jae-heon, you’re the bastard who f</em>cked Goyo?!”</p>
<p><em>Click.</em></p>
<p>Jae-heon sucked in a deep drag from his cigarette, then exhaled slowly.</p>
<p><em>“f</em>ck! Say something! Did you sleep with her or not?!”</p>
<p><em>“Watch your mouth.”</em></p>
<p>The smoke curled from his lips as his brows knitted together in irritation. His voice remained languid, but his expression was far from relaxed.</p>
<p><em>“You bastard! Perfect timing!”</em></p>
<p>Yoon-gun’s face twisted with rage, veins bulging at his temples. He had spent a month practically imprisoned in the hospital because of Kwon Jae-heon, and now, seeing him here, the fury boiled over.</p>
<p>He had always justified his humiliating defeat at the resort by claiming that Jae-heon had only won because he had numbers on his side. If it had been one-on-one, he had told Goyo, Jae-heon was nothing but a weak little shit.</p>
<p>Seeing Kwon Jae-heon standing there alone, Lee Yoon-gun grew even more agitated, his breath coming in ragged pants. He released Goyo’s hair and turned his full attention to Jae-heon. The sudden loss of grip sent Goyo stumbling, her body colliding with the hospital room wall.</p>
<p>Yoon-gun clenched his fists as if ready to take revenge for what had happened a month ago. Without hesitation, he strode toward Jae-heon and swung his arm at the taller man.</p>
<p>But the sound of flesh meeting flesh never came.</p>
<p>The moment Yoon-gun attacked, he was effortlessly restrained.</p>
<p><em>“Ah—f</em>ck! Son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>A curse burst from Yoon-gun’s mouth as Jae-heon twisted his arm back.</p>
<p><em>“Not only are you rude, but you’re also clueless.”</em></p>
<p>Jae-heon muttered as he tightened his grip on Yoon-gun’s wrist.</p>
<p>“<em>When someone lets you off easy, you should know when to stay down.”</em></p>
<p>His lips curled into a slow smirk, followed by a quiet scoff—almost as if regretting ever going easy on him in the first place.</p>
<p><em>“Ah—Agh! Let go, you bastard! Hot—f</em>ck, it’s hot!”</p>
<p>With a cigarette still between his fingers, Jae-heon pressed down on Yoon-gun’s arm, the smoldering tip hovering dangerously close to his bare skin.</p>
<p><em>“If you’re going to put up a fight, at least pick your opponent wisely.”</em></p>
<p>He applied more pressure, bending Yoon-gun’s wrist at an unnatural angle. Yoon-gun let out a strangled scream, writhing to free himself. Each desperate movement brought the burning ember closer to his flesh.</p>
<p><em>“F-f</em>ck… what kind of… bullshit are you spouting…?!”</p>
<p>“<em>You really don’t get it, do you? Annoying.”</em></p>
<p>Irritation laced Jae-heon’s voice as he suddenly lifted his foot and slammed it into the back of Yoon-gun’s knee.</p>
