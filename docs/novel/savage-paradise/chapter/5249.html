            <p><strong>Chapter 59</strong></p>
<p>While Goyo’s mind spiraled with worry, Jae-heon remained calm.</p>
<p>“This is my home turf. What, someone’s going to report me? Let them. I’ll pay the fine—it’s only five million won.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point… it’s humiliating… such a public—oh…”</p>
<p>“It’s not like it’s murder. Just a minor charge. God, Goyo, can you tighten your p*ssy a little bit more?”</p>
<p>He lowered his gaze, breathing hard through his nose.</p>
<p>“P-please, don’t talk like that…”</p>
<p>“What else should I call it?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to call it anything—ah…”</p>
<p>Despite her protests, her body responded. Reflexively tightening around him, she trembled, unable to resist. The sensation of his pulse throbbed vividly.</p>
<p>“I told you to tighten, not crush me,” he muttered, cursing under his breath.</p>
<p>Jae-heon exhaled sharply, his Adam’s apple bobbing. His large hands squeezed her hips firmly, as if anchoring himself. Her body contracted again, clenching tightly, drawing another shuddering breath from him.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes briefly, lost in the overwhelming sensation.</p>
<p>“Goyo… if you keep doing this… I can’t hold back. Babe, we really shouldn’t—like this…”</p>
<p>His voice, thick with desire, brushed against her ear, and Goyo’s vision blurred. The sounds of their bodies, his scent overwhelming her senses—it was all too much. She couldn’t think clearly. Somewhere along the way, her body began moving on its own, matching his rhythm.</p>
<p>Each time she sat back on his thighs and lifted slightly, his body moved within hers again, slick and heated. The feeling of him withdrawing, then returning with force, made her lose any grip on thought.</p>
<p>Jae-heon let out a low breath, one hand stroking her back as he tilted his head to kiss her. His lips pressed against hers—firm, unrelenting. The moment her lips parted from the stinging ache, his tongue slipped inside.</p>
<p>Above, their breaths mixed in a mess of heat and want. Below, he moved deeper, his pace increasing. Her body rocked with each movement, soft whimpers escaping her lips.</p>
<p>“Hah… ah… mmm…”</p>
<p>Goyo bit down on her lower lip, trying to stifle her moans. But his hips moved insistently, and the rhythm of skin meeting skin, the messy sounds of it, only grew louder.</p>
<p>Her body felt like it was floating, her mind going white. All the thoughts that had plagued her—every doubt, every question—vanished in the motion.</p>
<p>The truth behind the kidnapping… Ma soon-jin’s intentions…</p>
<p>What Kwon Moo-young really thought of her…</p>
<p>How long she could keep up this relationship with Jae-heon…</p>
<p>It all felt pointless now. In this moment, it didn’t matter if it was reckless. She could die doing something this mad and still feel like it was worth it.</p>
<p>‘I like it…so much I might just die from it.’</p>
<p>“Aah—ha… ngh, ah…”</p>
<p>Her voice broke free at last, no longer muffled, rising in a cry that filled the room.</p>
<p>“Yes, just like that. Breathe…”</p>
<p>“Ha… ngh…”</p>
<p>So this is how you forget the things that hurt. Not by trying, not by forcing it—but by surrendering to instinct, to someone who could pull you away from it all.</p>
<p>In Yi-taek’s house, it felt like she was withering away a little more each day. She couldn’t even remember the last time she fell asleep with a calm mind. She had to fight not to fall into despair. To protect herself, she’d worn masks, shielded her heart.</p>
<p>But those defenses meant nothing with Jae-heon.</p>
<p>The mask cracked. The shield broke. She laughed, she cried, she let herself be vulnerable.</p>
<p>With Yi-taek, she had to hide how she felt. Any emotion he hadn’t sanctioned came with punishment. But with Jae-heon, she could express anything. That freedom alone made her feel like she could breathe again.</p>
<p>I feel alive.</p>
<p>A bitter laugh escaped her.</p>
<p>“Ha… ha… ha…”</p>
<p>Was she laughing, or was she crying?</p>
<p>Goyo wrapped her arms around his neck, her breaths ragged, somewhere between pleasure and relief. She cried and laughed all at once.</p>
<p>She had to be losing her mind. Just like Jae-heon. But if she went mad with him, maybe that would be okay.</p>
<p>He exhaled slowly, eyes fluttering closed. His throat moved with each breath.</p>
<p>The rhythm picked up again—short, fast, rough movements. Their bodies collided, the sounds mixing with the creak of the chair legs struggling to hold them up.</p>
<p>The chair scraped backward with each thrust, the room filled with soft gasps and low groans, the air thick with the sharp scent of sweat and longing.</p>
<p>And still, their movements didn’t stop. As if nothing else in the world existed, they stayed entangled for a long time after.</p>
<p>They never made it back to the banquet hall.</p>
<p>Jae-heon pulled Goyo up to his office. He claimed it was to watch the fireworks set to begin at midnight, but that was just an excuse. His real intent was to be alone with her.</p>
<p>They welcomed the new year on that luxury sofa he’d once boasted about—how soft it was, yet how quickly it bounced back. In a haze of passion, time slipped away.</p>
<p>The sudden crack of fireworks drew Goyo’s gaze to the window.</p>
<p>Boom, boom. The sky burst into a cascade of dazzling colors. Tiny sparks streaked across the dark canvas, scattering radiant light. They painted brilliant shapes that slowly faded into the night.</p>
<p>Exploding in the shadows, the fireworks scattered like drifting flower petals, sprinkling the world in light and signaling the arrival of a new year.</p>
<p>Just as Jae-heon had said, the view from his office was stunning.</p>
<p>Pop. Crackle. Bursts of fire bloomed across the black sky in a hundred vivid shades.</p>
<p>But inside the office, another kind of heat filled the room. The soft thuds of skin meeting skin echoed rhythmically.</p>
<p>“Ah… Haa… Mmm…”</p>
<p>“You’re beautiful.”</p>
<p>Drunk on desire, Jae-heon’s hazy eyes lingered on Goyo’s bare form. His hands gripped her waist tightly, guiding her body against his. With every motion, taut muscles rippled under strain.</p>
<p>“Ah… You… you’re so beautiful.”</p>
<p>Breathing heavily, Goyo listened to the muffled sound of fireworks through the window.</p>
<p>Boom. Bang. Big and small bursts flared in turn, cascading like rain from the sky.</p>
<p>Goyo found herself mesmerized—by the fireworks, his scent, and the dizzying rush between them.</p>
<p>“No, I meant you,” he murmured.</p>
<p>His low voice was heavy with warmth. Reaching out to caress her face, Jae-heon whispered. His gentle words settled against her ear like falling sparks.</p>
<p>“Happy New Year, Lee Goyo.”</p>
<p>“…You too, Jae-heon. Happy New Year.”</p>
<p>May this serenity, born of madness, never be broken.</p>
