            <p><strong>Chapter 9.1</strong></p>
<p>Puzzlement filled the silent eyes. But that was all it was. There was not the slightest hint of fondness or affection that countless women had shown him in the past.</p>
<p>“Jae-heon, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Ji Seohyun raised her voice. She had come to play the role of a demure girlfriend, and now her man was about to go to a room with another woman right in front of her, making her furious.</p>
<p>“Kwon Jae-heon, what the hell are you doing? You’re doing this on purpose because of me!”</p>
<p>Park Jung-hoon also confronted Jae-heon with a face full of anger.</p>
<p>‘Yes, this is the typical reaction.’</p>
<p>To Kwon Jae-heon, Lee Goyo was different from ordinary people.</p>
<p>Even Ji Seohyun, whose job was acting, couldn’t hide her emotions and raised her voice. Park Jung-hoon, the heir to a media conglomerate who knew well how terrifying public scrutiny could be, couldn’t contain his anger and spat out harsh words. Unlike someone who only showed her surprise by slightly widening her large eyes or nervously chewing her small lips.</p>
<p>A month ago, her expression at the resort differed greatly from now. She might have widened her eyes a bit at the sight of the bloodied Lee Yoon-gun, and when he roughly clung to her, her lower lip might have slightly creased inward.</p>
<p>Even with blood, even with dirt, her face hardly changed.</p>
<p>‘How intriguing.’</p>
<p>And so, Kwon Jae-heon became curious. What expression would she make when she was under him?</p>
<p>Until just now, getting involved with a political figure like her was out of the question. Despite the rumors, he had no intention of making a mess. He had intended to relieve the stress that had built up over time by holding Ji Seohyun, who was not only charming but also discreet. But the sweet scent of her body, the alluring curves of her chest, suddenly felt mundane.</p>
<p>It was because of the gaze of this woman, looking up at him. Curious about how she would react when he had her in his possession, thoughts of anything else simply didn’t occur to him.</p>
<p>“I need an answer.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>People seemed to understand why they called Goyo a doll. There was something about her that didn’t feel human.</p>
<p>The auction had come to a halt unnoticed. All attention was focused on them, making it impossible to proceed.</p>
<p>The confession of Park Jung-hoon, the heir to Sungjo Daily. The dash of KJ Financial’s CEO, Kwon Jae-heon. All thanks to the actress Ji Seohyun, on the brink of being abandoned.</p>
<p>A melodramatic drama, akin to what you might see on morning broadcasts, unfolded before them.</p>
<p>A morning broadcast-style melodrama was unfolding before them.</p>
<p>Regardless of the process, Goyo ultimately accepted Kwon Jae-heon’s proposal. In truth, it was a choice not worth pondering. Park Jung-hoon, unaware of the circumstances, was shocked.</p>
<p>Ji Seo-hyun couldn’t believe that Kwon Jae-heon had chosen another woman over her. She followed the two as they left the auction hall and grabbed onto his arm.</p>
<p>“Jae-heon, you can’t do this to me.”</p>
<p>Her voice was urgent, almost strangled. It cracked and even sounded metallic.</p>
<p>“I cleared my schedule for today because of you.”</p>
<p>“I’ll contact you later.”</p>
<p>“When? It’s been a year since we last met.”</p>
<p>The three halted in front of the elevator leading to the room. Clearly uncomfortable with the situation, Kwon Jae-heon lowered his gaze.</p>
<p>“A threesome isn’t my cup of tea.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere grew even more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sound of the door closing rang out unusually loud.</p>
<p>It was a luxurious hotel suite. If she hadn’t intervened, it would have been the place where Kwon Jae-heon and Ji Seo-hyun had s*x.</p>
<p>Because of the desperate situation where Ji Seo-hyun clung to Kwon Jae-heon until the elevator door opened, Goyo was not at ease.</p>
<p>‘What do you mean by sloppy? That’s not it… How long have I been waiting for today? Me, you, Jae-heon tonight…’</p>
<p>‘Stop.’</p>
<p>‘Is it because of that woman? Am I more important than that woman…?’</p>
<p>‘I can’t listen to you.’</p>
<p>When he showed his discomfort, Ji Seo-hyun glared at Goyo with fierce eyes and closed her mouth. Her expression was full of unspoken words.</p>
<p>But no more conversation followed. Kwon Jae-heon and Goyo entered the elevator.</p>
<p>Since they met, one thing has been clear between Kwon Jae-heon and Ji Seo-hyun—they will never be more than s*x partners. The nature of Jae-heon’s job isn’t conducive to a serious relationship, which he sees as a weak link he can’t afford.</p>
