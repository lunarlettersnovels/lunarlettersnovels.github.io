            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 72 – In the Same Bed (2)</strong></p>
<p>Not only did Amelia fall asleep, she also slept so soundly and dreamlessly that she felt like a newborn baby.</p>
<p>Sunlight filtered in through the windows on the side, waking Amelia to consciousness. She stirred on her sleep with eyes fluttering lazily and she was instantly greeted by a mass of honey-toned skin.</p>
<p>The thin quilt was draped over the elf’s waist, revealing his upper torso— particularly his naked chest. His body was toned and curves of muscle covered every inch of his skin.</p>
<p>It was a mouth-watering sight.</p>
<p>Amelia’s eyes followed the contours of his flesh, eyes trailing upwards until it reached his face, which was staring dazedly at the ceiling. Feeling her gaze on him, he craned his neck and a smirk slowly crept to his face. “Drooling over me, aren’t you?” He teased.</p>
<p>“You wish!”</p>
<p>Still addled with sleep, Amelia rubbed her eyes and said groggily, “Stop with that nonsense. I never drool.”</p>
<p>The flatness of her tone left no room for argument. Alfonso surprisingly felt annoyed and relieved at the same time, seeing that she was back to her usual self.</p>
<p>Amelia went to the bathroom and leaned over the sink, washing her face with cold water when she was yet again reminded of the elf’s identity, the carelessness of her words making her pause for a second.</p>
<p><em>Forget it. There are more things to worry about.</em></p>
<p>She wiped the water off her face, yawning as she stretched her arms on top of her head.</p>
<p>Worrying about it was pointless anyway, since she would still be dead once Alfonso recovers his memories.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The Light cult used most of their manpower and resources to hunt the divination witch, Bella that they didn’t notice the black book gone. And even when Amelia placed it back quietly, the Light cult was too engrossed looking for the escapee to spare it any glance.</p>
<p>There were people who tried to read the book to no avail, unable to pry it open and only a few people were able to, but even when they did manage to open it, the only thing they’re greeted with were blanks of pages.</p>
<p>Among thousands of religious believers and nearly 10,000 ordinary civilians, Amelia was the only one who could see what’s written inside.</p>
<p>Amelia didn’t disclose the fact to anyone, however. She showed a confused expression— matching everyone’s, when she opened the book and went on pretending she couldn’t see anything and thankfully, everyone believed her.</p>
<p>Since all of them were unable to figure out what to do with the book, Debra proposed to surrender it to the Pope instead, and have him decide what to do with it.</p>
<p>Amelia nearly forgot about the witch who had been confined in the dungeons. She hastily went to grab her and led her back to the Church.</p>
<p>A day before they departed the city, Amelia tasked Alfonso to go pack her luggage while she went out with Rita to enjoy herself.</p>
<p>“Lazy ass.” The elf gritted through his teeth, standing close to the bedroom window as he watched the woman running out like a distracted child.</p>
<p>Tentacles sprawled from behind him and enveloped the entire room with a thick, black mist. It looked absolutely forbidding, the tentacles appeared like it had human remains grasped on its’ multiple holds.</p>
<p>But when one looked closely, the tentacles were actually clutching onto Amelia’s clothes— which was far from human remains. They were studiously attending to the task at hand; some were washing the clothes and drying them on hangers, some were folding and packing the luggage. It only took them an hour at most to set everything in place.</p>
<p>The tentacles whimpered, like they couldn’t believe they’ve been reduced to being a mere household help under the strict orders they’ve been given.</p>
<p>Amelia on the other hand, ran into a mobile slave market as soon as she stepped out of the dining hall.</p>
<p>It was referred to as such since largely built iron cages were hung on a carriage. Creatures of various shapes and sizes curled up inside: Some were hairy, thin, and others looked odd in appearance.</p>
<p>The crowd gathered around to watch, pointing fingers at the creatures that got their attention. There were times when aristocrats wearing expensive-looking garbs came barging in, trying to set a deal with the slave owners until both parties agreed on a price.</p>
<p>“This is quite interesting. The merchants are actually good at this. Look, they even caught a white elf.” Rita said as she nudged Amelia’s arm.</p>
<p>Amelia’s ears pricked up at the mention of the word ‘elf’. Her eyes scanned the cages until it landed on a white elf caged on the side.</p>
<p>This elf was completely the opposite of Alfonso. His skin was white, whereas the latter was dark. He had jade-like skin, and golden hair was tossed above his head. His silver eyes were calm and collected, looking at the crowd with a cold yet expressionless gaze.</p>
<p>Even when he’s dressed in ragged clothes, his beauty still stood out and it was utterly mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Amelia blinked, realizing that he was probably the most beautiful creature to ever exist— next to Alfonso.</p>
