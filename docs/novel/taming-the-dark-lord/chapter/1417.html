            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 7 – A Sudden Fury (2)</strong></p>
<p>As if doused in cold water, Amelia was suddenly snapped out of her senses. She internally palmed herself for having forgotten that this was not an ordinary human baby. It was a dark elf, and it hated the religion of light with a burning passion.</p>
<p>Since she used magic a while ago, there might have been some Light particles scattered around the air, and some of it was caught by the elf.</p>
<p>Amelia felt something was off. She pulled the elf’s chin and looked at him closely. “I thought you don’t remember anything?”</p>
<p>The unwarranted physical contact angered the elf once again, and he swiped at her quickly with his claws wide open.</p>
<p>With fast reflex, Amelia was able to pull her arm out of the way, the elf’s claw only grazing her skin at the surface. A red, small scratch was marked on her skin.</p>
<p>Amelia then took a few steps back, keeping a sizable distance between the elf and herself.</p>
<p>Looking at the dark creature from a distance, his scarred body tied on the bed looked like a wild beast that got beaten up by its’ handler; in a futile attempt to discipline the untamed animal.</p>
<p>Amelia placed her hands on her hips. She was so angry that she could beat the elf up with her bare hands. “Look at the bandages on your body. I was the one who wrapped them up for you, you ungrateful bastard! I saved your life for nothing!” She shouted, pointing at the elf’s direction.</p>
<p>Following Amelia’s finger, the elf glanced down on his body that was shrouded with bandages.</p>
<p>The white bandages stood out from his dark skin, which was smeared with mud and dried up blood. He could see the crusts of dirt lining up the bandages, soiling the white wraps around his body. The plaster contrasted greatly with his dark skin, like a small white flower in the middle of the swamp.</p>
<p>Just like the woman he’s in front of.</p>
<p>The elf lifted his head. He really did not remember anything, nor did he remember where he came from. Everything was pretty much a blank slate.</p>
<p>Despite completely incognizant, the elf still had the innate thought of hating everything that is related to the cult of Light.</p>
<p>If he could move, he would surely enjoy crushing this woman into smithereens and throw her into a deep abyss where she would undoubtedly die.</p>
<p>The dark elf’s eyes fired once again. But this time, he did not move at all, only looking at Amelia with eyes that were simmering like boiling water.</p>
<p>He refused to surrender. He was memorizing Amelia’s features, imprinting the way she looked right into his brain, wondering when he could get his revenge. He wanted to bite her skin with his sharp teeth.</p>
<p>With the elf looking at her with eyes full of murderous intent, Amelia no longer held the fondness she initially had for the tiny elf. This dark creature was nothing but a menace.</p>
<p>Silence filled the basement as they stared at each other down, one not pleased with the other’s presence. Even in his laid position, the elf still glared at Amelia with no intention of stopping.</p>
<p>His soft, white hair was tossed messily above his face, and Amelia thought that if those tresses covered his eyes, the elf would’ve been much pleasant to look at.</p>
<p>Amelia then packed her stuff, not paying the shackled elf any attention as she turned and left the basement.</p>
<p>She was not in the mood for more confrontation, especially when the elf is being cold and aggressive towards her despite everything she’s done for him. She knew that she would lose it if she stayed in the room with the ungrateful elf, so she decided to leave him alone for the meantime.</p>
<p>Amelia made sure to close the door with a brute force, the jamb shaking from the impact.</p>
<p>This is where the saints reside, the paradise and the core center of the religion of Light. Although no one would dare enter her palace without her consent, she still needs to take precautionary measures to keep the elf hidden. If someone founds out about this, not only would the elf be killed mercilessly, there would also be severe consequences for her as well.</p>
<p>Now when Amelia thought about it, she has no one to blame but herself. Her impulsiveness brought her here, and now she has to take care of it.</p>
<p>Other than the elf inside her room, she also had another problem to worry about. <em>Debra.</em></p>
