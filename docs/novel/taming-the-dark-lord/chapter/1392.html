            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 32 – Sulking</strong></p>
<p>All her memories were laid out in front him: from the events that transpired today, to losing the chief position over a week ago, down to all her experiences that she went through after reigning as a saint.</p>
<p>“Tsk.” Alfonso frowned in evident disgust as his eyes caught sight of an unsightly memory. He quickly pushed it out of his view and continued to dig through Debra’s memories.</p>
<p>Memories were an integral part of the human soul. So when he was reading Debra’s memories, he was actually looking straight to her soul, the depths of her core.</p>
<p>A snapping sound echoed in their surroundings. Debra’s beautiful face contorted into a hideous sight. Her soul could not bear the pressure it was currently going through, producing a faint creaking sound as the elf went through her memories.</p>
<p>However effective this method of reading memories may be, it was also rough to an extent, and one wrong move could potentially damage the soul. Since Debra had strong and powerful magic lying inside her depths, she managed to persist for quite a long time. Ordinary people would’ve probably been broken the second their souls were touched.</p>
<p>Even with how strong Debra was, she was still human after all, and she was already nearing her limit.</p>
<p>If this went on further, her soul would definitely collapse.</p>
<p>The elf seethed. The flipping of Debra’s memories did not cease, only going faster and faster. He wanted to find the person on the other side of the chain before Debra’s soul was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Alfonso didn’t mind that someone got hurt by what he’s doing, nor did he care whether it had anything to do with Amelia, the annoying lackey.</p>
<p>He only did this for the sole purpose of finding the person behind this mess. The person he was getting the blame for.</p>
<p>Recalling the way he’s accused earlier, Alfonso’s eyes became even more colder than it already was.</p>
<p>“Uh!” Debra croaked as she spat a mouthful of blood. Her body slackened on the tentacles’ chokehold as her neck lolled to the side.</p>
<p>The bright red splatters of blood contrasted greatly with the snow-white floor. It was just like a bandage that had blood seeping through its cloth— just like the one Amelia had wrapped for him before.</p>
<p>The elf’s trembling hand suddenly stopped as he was reminded of the woman’s eyes. If this person died because of him, Amelia would surely nag his ears off.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it was enough to make his blood boil.</p>
<p>Alfonso guessed that he should probably resort to other methods, one that didn’t include this person’s death. Anything was better than listening to Amelia mouthing him off.</p>
<p>He retracted his hand, and let the connection fall back into the void. The tentacle gripping Debra loosened its hold, making her body fall to the ground with a loud thud.</p>
<p>Alfonso didn’t bother transforming back to his small, elf appearance. He maintained his original size, and sauntered back to Amelia’s place.</p>
<p>He got his strength back tenfold, and no one would be able to trace him. He fixed his black robe in place, and walked around in the middle of the night like a lone, lost soul.</p>
<p>The fat tentacles were playing around at his feet, occasionally eating small animals that happened to pass by.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, he finally saw the familiar palace from afar, and saw that the place had its lights turned on brightly. Alfonso pushed the door open and walked inside. As soon as his foot touched the floor, a figure instantly stood in front of him, and blocked his entrance.</p>
<p>“Where have you been?!” Amelia screeched. It was clear that she was angry. Her face was fuming and she had her arms akimbo. “So you are now bold enough to sneak out at night, right?”</p>
<p>“I told you that you can’t let other people see you! Are my words falling into deaf ears? Didn’t I make myself clear enough? You… Hey!”</p>
<p>Alfonso passed by silently, as if he didn’t hear her at all. Using his strength for quite a long time had him extremely exhausted. Although he didn’t show it, his brows were scrunched together in agitation.</p>
<p>His contour was deep, which accentuated his cheekbones. And when he frowned, his appearance looked especially fierce than usual, like he was infuriated with everything and everyone.</p>
<p>Amelia stepped back as her eyes followed Alfonso’s tall and slender form walking to the basement. The man can be really scary at times. Upon looking at his retreating form, she saw his pair of ears all swollen and red hidden behind his silver hair.</p>
<p>It seemed like she went overboard when she pinched him earlier.</p>
<p>Amelia closed the door. She realized that she had overreacted, and decided to apologize to him first thing tomorrow.</p>
<p>The following morning, Amelia made breakfast, and knocked on the basement door a couple of times. “Alfonso?” She called softly, “It’s already morning. Are you awake yet? Want to have breakfast?”</p>
<p>There seemed to be no movement inside the basement, but Amelia was sure that the elf heard her.</p>
<p>She knocked a few more times, knocking a little more forcefully. “Alfonso, listen to me. I was wrong about yesterday. Even if you did pull quite a stunt, I never should’ve pulled your ears like that. It’s my fault—“</p>
<p>“Bang!”</p>
<p>Amelia was cut short by a certain item colliding against the door. It seemed like the elf threw the candlestick on the table in retaliation. She took a deep breath, and smacked the door repeatedly. “You better stop. I have already apologized. Stop throwing a fit!”</p>
<p>No response from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>She called him for a long time, banging her fists on the door as the elf continually ignored her. ‘<em>This elf had gone wild. He had gone completely, frustratingly, disobedient.’</em></p>
<p>This couldn’t go on. Amelia won’t allow it. If she didn’t reprimand him now, it would certainly be more a lot harder for her in the future.</p>
<p>She paced back and forth in front of the door, thinking of a way to coax him out of the basement and forgive her. After pondering for a while, she turned her heels and left quietly.</p>
<p>After a short while, she came back and knocked on the door once more. “Alfonso? I have a book regarding dark elves. Do you want to read it? Didn’t you want to know more about your background?”</p>
<p>The elf opened his eyes, his scarlet pupils glinting in the dark.</p>
<p>“Do you want it or not?” Amelia egged, “If you want it, come out and get it.”</p>
<p>The closed door opened slowly, making the hinge squeak as the elf came out at a brisk speed. He abruptly took the book from Amelia’s hand before banging the door close, again.</p>
