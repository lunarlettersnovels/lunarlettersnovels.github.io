            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 10 – Spitting Venom (2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Here it goes.</em></p>
<p>Amelia’s heart felt like it’s going to burst out of her chest. She clenched her fists at her sides, and fixed her eyes on the door at the right side of the room. She was ready to barrel out of class if Debra ever says anything incriminating.</p>
<p>Maybe she should go for it right this instant. But Amelia somehow hoped she didn’t need to resort to this, wishing for things to work in her favor at the last minute. She had a pretty comfortable life right now, and she didn’t want to make use of her days by constantly running away.</p>
<p>Amelia could hear the thrashing of her heart, and Debra’s light chuckles seem to grow louder by the second. Debra opened her mouth, the sight prompting Amelia to slowly rise from her seat, ready to get away as fast as possible when—</p>
<p>“Rita.”</p>
<p><em>What.</em></p>
<p>A blonde seated on the front row raised her head and glanced at Debra. “Oh?”</p>
<p>Debra stared at the blonde and crossed her arms. Not bothering to make small talk, Debra went straight into it as she divulged. “Your identity is forged, isn’t it? You’re not an orphan, but an illegitimate daughter. Am I correct?”</p>
<p>Everybody glanced at Rita, who looked completely caught off guard. She gulped as she forced a blank face. “How dare you accuse me of such? This is outright slander! Do you even have proof?” Rita screeched.</p>
<p>Debra smiled. “As a matter of fact, I have.” She turned around and took a sealed document from the table, putting it upright for everyone to see.</p>
<p>With Amelia still halfway up from her seat, the instructor pushed her back down. “No skipping of classes.”</p>
<p>Amelia bit her lips as she nodded.</p>
<p>Did she overanalyze everything?</p>
<p>Amelia was astounded. Although she felt relieved for not needing to run off anymore, she was quite disappointed for having been so worked up on something that is entirely unrelated to her.</p>
<p>She thought too much of herself. Debra wasn’t referring to her at all.</p>
<p>While she’s having these thoughts, the two Saints who got the highest approval ratings were at each other’s neck, continuing on with their heated discussion as everyone stared silently.</p>
<p>The document Debra showed was Rita’s birth certificate, which stated the name of her mother only. The name of her father was unknown.</p>
<p>Debra continued. “Not only you are an illegitimate daughter, your mother was a prostitute as well.”</p>
<p>Rita’s face went pale, her mouth slightly agape.</p>
<p>Upon Debra’s statement, the Saints inside the classroom stared sharply at Rita, pointing fingers while they expressed her disbelief. They called Rita a disappointment and an embarrassment to the Saints. The combination of hurtful words and blatant gesturing made Rita weak on her spot, her heart aching tremendously it might as well split into two.</p>
<p>From the people’s perspective, an illegitimate child was nothing but a disgrace to the society. An abomination.</p>
<p>The God of light dominates the whole continent, and governs hundred of countries, whether it is big or small. There were many strict requirements to follow in order to be selected as a Saint.</p>
<p>With such dishonorable background, Rita should’ve been removed from the selections from the very start, and she shouldn’t have been a Saint.</p>
<p>Raucous words were thrown at Rita’s direction, like a clown in a circus where people pointed and ridiculed her.</p>
<p>Feeling frightened, Rita’s voice grew hoarse as she tried to fend for herself. “You must’ve forged this.”</p>
<p>Debra smiled menacingly, her grin reaching her eyes. “How about we go to the Pope’s crown to have this checked? Let him see if this document is forged or not.”</p>
<p>Rita looked absolutely terrified. Her hands trembled, cold sweat running down her back.</p>
<p>Debra’s companion uttered. “Do you still dare compete with Debra for the chief position? Do you still have any dignity left in you?”</p>
<p>“You’re a prostitute’s daughter. You’re not worthy of the position.” Someone from the back called out.</p>
<p>“So disgusting. I can’t believe I talked to her.” Rita’s seatmate sniggered.</p>
<p>All the Saints in the room murmured loudly, and Rita heard them all.</p>
<p>“So.” Debra said, giving the document another look, her eyes reading it line by line as she smiled ruefully. “Are you going there by yourself? Or do you want me to go with you?”</p>
<p>Rita closed her eyes, feeling bile rise up her throat.</p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>The door of the Church flew open. The intricately designed door made of gold and jade inlays smashed against the adjacent wall, the echo ringing loudly in everyone’s ears. The Saints turned around, and saw a tall figure entering the room.</p>
<p>With the scepter on one hand, the Pope swiftly brought himself inside, his nose protruding highly from his face, and his deep-set eyes looked intimidating as ever.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to tell me. I hear you loud and clear.”</p>
