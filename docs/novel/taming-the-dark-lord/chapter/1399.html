            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 25 – The Dark God (2)</strong></p>
<p>Those words seemed to be engraved deep into his soul. Even if he lost his memories and couldn’t remember anything, those words appeared to be the only thing he knows surely of.</p>
<p><em>He’s not a God, is he?</em></p>
<p>Under the order of the Light theocracy, all books that contained information about the Dark God were destroyed, and burned into ashes. Even uttering words related to the Him would lead to one’s arrest, and it is considered as sacrilegious.</p>
<p>So Amelia knew nothing about the Dark God.</p>
<p>However, she still had a few ideas in mind based on the telltales she managed to hear. “Dark God. I think I’ve read about him before.” Amelia seemed to be thinking deeply, “He is also called Lord of Darkness. From what I heard, he had four arms and eight legs, and his face looked like a bat. There’s no gap between his two eyes, and his whole body was covered with thick, black hair. I reckon that he is unpleasant to look at.”</p>
<p>The dark elf conjured the image of the Dark God based on Amelia’s description.</p>
<p>It’s absolutely hideous. He was beyond mortified, clearly displeased with how the Dark God looked like. He crossed the thought out of his mind.</p>
<p>“Why the sudden question?” Amelia said as she leafed through her book.</p>
<p>He couldn’t tell her the truth so he snarled ruthlessly. “It’s none of your business.”</p>
<p>Amelia rolled her eyes in response and resumed reading.</p>
<p>As the night went on, the darkness outside grew deeper and deeper. The texts Amelia was reading jumbled with one another as her eyes drifted close, her exhaustion lulling her to sleep. With the book tucked beneath her pillow, Amelia’s eyes snapped shut as a low voice sounded behind her.</p>
<p>“Alfonso. My name is Alfonso.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When she got up the next morning, Amelia, who was still dazed with sleep, almost stepped on the elf’s back from where he was lying face down on the ground.</p>
<p>“Oh, I didn’t let you go last night?” She asked in a hoarse voice, stretched her arms above her head and rubbed the sleep from her eyes. “Go back to the bed in the basement. I won’t take you out today.” She said as she freed the elf from her magic.</p>
<p>He stood up. He clenched his fists at his sides, and glowered at Amelia’s direction. He was upset for having spent the whole night paralyzed. “Lackey, what else do you want from me? Or do you want to leave me to someone else?”</p>
<p>With the little time that she had, Amelia hastily dressed up using her magic. She went straight to her books and rummaged through the pile. “You haven’t slept all night. You can go if you want, and no one will stop you.”</p>
<p>Amelia was too preoccupied to pay the elf any mind. After searching for the book for a long time, she turned around and felt her pocket sink.</p>
<p>She lowered her head and saw a little figure was curled up inside it. Alfonso put out his head and looked up at her warily, before covering himself with the piece of cloth her pocket had.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Amelia placed her palm against her chest. He found his action endearing, despite being quite a handful most of the time.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The Saints have a small torture chamber. And in that chamber, there were several dark creatures lined up on one corner, which are readily available all year round. It was where the Saints took creatures out; using them to practice their magic on.</p>
<p>Amelia left her palace a little late. When she got to the torture chamber, most of the Saints were already divided into groups, every one of them engrossed in conversation.</p>
<p>This was the first time she had presided over a large-scale event as Pope, and many people were already anticipating seeing her performance up close. The crowd stood around with Debra at the center, and the Saints nudged each other upon seeing Amelia’s arrival. They spared her glances every now and then, and they didn’t even bother making their gazes inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Amelia’s lip curled slightly.</p>
<p>It seemed like people still chose Debra to preside over the Ceremony, and she was entirely pleased to see that since she bore the same sentiment as them.</p>
<p>Amelia smiled. She took the key out of her pocket, and opened the door to the torture chamber.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the creatures from getting out, no windows were placed inside the room, and magic was also casted to fend off escapees. The room was fixed with a solid metal everywhere, blocking each and every gap you could find, So when the door was opened, the room was pitch-black, and one wouldn’t be able to see clearly from the outside.</p>
<p>As the Saints filtered in, the magical light placed on the walls shone brightly as it revealed two trembling girls, which are hung unceremoniously from the shelf.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s the newly captured witch at the inquisition. And they provided two, no less. And finally it’s a big one.” The Saint behind Amelia said.</p>
<p>Amelia’s fingers jittered shakily. She took a deep breath and plastered a smile on her face as the Saints poured inside the chamber.</p>
<p>“Do you have any books with you? I should have brought the witch’s mallet with me.”</p>
<p>“Of course not. I thought they would only provide us with small animals, which is why I didn’t bring my books. And I don’t really remember much about it. Do you still remember?”</p>
<p>Debra smiled at the other Saints, her face gentle and assuring. “You don’t have to worry. I’ve memorized it all in my head. Just ask me if you have any questions.”</p>
<p>“Debra’s amazing.”</p>
<p>“No wonder she’s the most outstanding Saint there is. She even memorized the whole book!”</p>
<p>The Saints exclaimed in pure excitement as they huddled around Debra, asking her question after question. They seemed to have forgotten who the real Pope was.</p>
<p>Debra chuckled as Amelia passed the corner of her eye. This is what real power looked like. Having people’s full devotion despite having no crown perched above her head. Debra smiled, fully satisfied with herself.</p>
