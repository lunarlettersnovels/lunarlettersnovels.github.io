            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 63 – No Ordinary Elf (3)</strong></p>
<p>When Debra was out of their sight, she spread her palms out where a few poisonous fruits were perched. The hard shell reflected the moonlight and it gleamed brightly under the night sky, as if mocking her for being so soft hearted.</p>
<p>She had the chance to poison Amelia right there and then, but she backed out at the last minute. Debra gazed at the faint bonfire at the distance, looking at Amelia’s silhouette and thinking that this will be the last time she’ll let her go unharmed.</p>
<p>Next time, Amelia won’t be as lucky.</p>
<p>Amelia stood there for a while and picked up the few sour fruits that had fallen from the trees, and discreetly stuffed one inside her pocket. She turned her head and met the witch’s gaze, stretching her hand out and offered her one. “Hey, do you want some?”</p>
<p>The witch shook her head.</p>
<p>The forest was quiet, and the only sound around them were the fires crackling up in the air as it lit up their resting place like fireflies.</p>
<p>While Debra was elsewhere, Amelia crouched beside the witch and whispered, “Do you know anything about the dark spells, which can make people lose their minds and go crazy?” She asked quietly, her eyes automatically shifting to the purse that was attached on her waist.</p>
<p>Since she took the elf with her, her purse could no longer hold any coins nor any of her stuff. Amelia couldn’t see the elf’s expression clearly through the thick fabric, but she knew him well enough that he’s probably rolling his eyes again, or mockingly making faces towards her direction.</p>
<p>His five senses were always on high alert so his ears would automatically perk up, and he always eavesdropped every chance he got.</p>
<p>It was a bad habit of his, and as Amelia thought about his pointed ears, she was suddenly reminded of the smooth feeling when she touched them before.</p>
<p>Despite his dark skin, his skin was actually in excellent condition; all smooth and honey-toned and when you touched his pointed ears, his flesh would instantly redden upon contact. It was soft and cold to the touch, and Amelia was really fond of it.</p>
<p>It’s a pity that the elf doesn’t want his ears to be touched, but she managed to grasp it several times when she charged towards him before.</p>
<p>Amelia was still thinking about the elf when the witch answered, “There is a lot, actually.”</p>
<p>“A lot?” Amelia remembered the necromancer’s words and thought it over, “But what happened after you left? You seem not quite yourself when you came back.”</p>
<p>Of course, what Amelia said was an understatement. The witch had completely lost it that day and it was really an alarming sight.</p>
<p>The witch closed her eyes, and her wrinkles were made more prominent as shadows danced on her face, making it seem like she was several years older than she was.</p>
<p>She didn’t say anything for a long time, and Amelia thought that maybe it was insensitive of her to ask such a personal matter. She didn’t want to make the witch uncomfortable, and she was about to change the subject when the witch spoke silently,</p>
<p>“I ran into a devil that day…” The witch said hesitatingly, as if she was afraid of being chased down by someone Amelia doesn’t know of.</p>
<p>The witch couldn’t put the image out of her head, and if it weren’t for Amelia’s kindness towards her, the witch wouldn’t have said anything and rather keep it to herself.</p>
<p>“Devil?” Amelia repeated, not really sure what the witch meant by that.</p>
<p>Angels and Demons used to exist in this continent, along with several gods but that was already a long time ago. And those words were not normally uttered anymore, and gods had not resurfaced for such a long time.</p>
<p>Even during the Sacred Ceremonies the Light Cult holds every thousand of years, the Light God would only descend then— and uninterestedly at that, too.</p>
<p>The gods seemed to be more withdrawn from the human world as the years went by.</p>
<p>The witch went stiff, her jaw set so firmly Amelia could hear the faint sound of her teeth chattering. “When I passed through the forest, the devil instantly caught me. He threatened me and took away my sanity and my soul. He even tried to take other people’s lives using my body.”</p>
<p>Amelia nodded, paying attention to the witch’s words. “What did he look like?”</p>
<p>“Dark skin, long, white hair and a face that was full of golden knife wounds. He looked as if he was cut several times, all the way to his body…”</p>
<p>Amelia thought how odd the man looked based on the witch’s description. But the more she listened to the witch’s words, the more familiar this demon got.</p>
<p>“Was the devil a man?” Amelia asked, making sure that her guess was right.</p>
<p>The witch closed her eyes. “Demons have no gender. He only uses a shell to walk freely here on earth. Don’t be deceived by such illusions and don’t get lured into his trap because you will surely lose your soul when you do..”</p>
<p>So it was a man, Amelia concluded.</p>
<p>She stood up, smiled at the witch who was looking at her and told her, “Sorry, there’s something I need to do. Can you please wait here for a bit? I’ll be back before you know it.”</p>
