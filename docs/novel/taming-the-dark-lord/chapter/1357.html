            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 67 – The Prophecy (1)</strong></p>
<p>“There’s no reason to fear, I am not a bad person.” Bella smiled, her pitch-black eyes lightening until it turned translucent like glass. “I’m just here to deliver this.” Her pupils disappeared from view, leaving only a white void in its place. From the way she was staring blankly at the space before them, it appeared like she couldn’t see anything at all.</p>
<p>Before any of this happened, Bella had always had her head bent down on her chest, her unruly black hair covered most of her face and she walked so ordinarily that no one suspected that she was in fact, blind.</p>
<p>“Deliver?” Debra repeated. “Deliver what? Your life?” Her face paled in anger, her fists clenching so hard that her nails marked her palms. “How bold of you to deliver something, here at the Church too of all places. You have quite the nerve, huh? How dare you look down on us.”</p>
<p>A team of fully-equipped knights rushed in, encircling the black-haired girl and trapped her in the middle with their swords drawn out. They kept their distance away from the fiery black and reds that still loomed around her.</p>
<p>Bella raised her head and faced the knights head on, smiling slightly and unbothered at the swords threatening to pierce her. “I know you could feel it too. I am here for you, and this book is very important. You must read it carefully.”</p>
<p>Her eyes were empty and unseeing, looking at nothing in particular. No one knew who exactly she was talking to, and she didn’t bother to explain as she continued, “I’ve waited for you for quite a long time, more than a hundred years. I am so thrilled that you finally came. In the near future though, you will be facing a crisis so great that it may cost you your life.”</p>
<p>Bella’s voice toned down, a hint of sadness in her words. “I’m here to deliver this book and I hope it will lend you a helping hand. I don’t know what the future holds, but I will try my best to help you however way I can.”</p>
<p>The book that was flipping its pages violently flew up into the air, giving out a dazzling bright light that everyone in the room covered their eyes with their forearms, the brilliance too blinding and encompassing, casting no shadows around them.</p>
<p>“I hope to see you in the future.”</p>
<p>Bella’s voice faded all at once, like a color that was wiped off completely. They heard a loud thud fall to the floor and the gleaming light vanished as soon as it had come. They peeked at their surroundings and saw no one standing before them, as if Bella wasn’t there at all, like she was nothing but a figment of their imagination. The black book lying on the floor was the only indication that all of what happened was real, and far from being a dream.</p>
<p>It all happened so fast.</p>
<p>The Church was broken into by the witch just like that, and she even managed to escape just as easily.</p>
<p>It was a clear message. The witch waged a war by provoking the Light cult with her presence, going in and out of the Church as if she owned the place. The rashness of her actions was like a slap in the face.</p>
<p>The Church members were fuming with anger, and the Bishop immediately displaced all the soldiers to chase down the witch as fast as they could, leaving no stone unturned as they vowed to make her pay for what she did.</p>
<p>They were in an absolute chaos; soldiers rummaging about, the Bishop shouting in anger and others were fretting in panic.</p>
<p>Amelia was standing at the corner of the room, paying no heed to the commotion around her as her eyes zeroed in on the book lying on the ground, making out a few texts scribbled in gold on the black cover. It was an unfamiliar sight, one that she had never seen before. It looked like a mess of tangled tree branches looped with one another, wildly incoherent to her skimming eyes.</p>
<p>She was oddly fascinated by it, curiosity getting the better of her.</p>
<p>“She’s the divination witch.” The skinny woman suddenly voiced out, “I’ve heard of her before, and she has lived for a long time. She uses witchcraft to prophesize the future. She is powerful and difficult to win against, but even with her grim nature, I have never heard of her killing anyone.”</p>
<p>Amelia remained unhearing. The latter’s words went in one ear and out the other. The book wholly had her attention like it was prodding her to come closer, to go open it and read its contents. The temptation grasped her insides, thinking that she’d know everything once she had it in her hands.</p>
<p>As if pulled by an unknown force, Amelia walked towards the book mindlessly and passed through the troubled crowd step after step. The toes of her feet made contact with the icy spine of the book, noting that it was cold and soft— just like a corpse’s flesh.</p>
<p>She gazed down, and the three golden letters trembled in its place like spiders crawling in black mud. The thin branches slithered to the sides and it slowly opened the book in front of her—</p>
<p>The pages flashed once again and she could read the texts clearly<em>:</em></p>
<p><em>The Dark God is one of the most ancient and powerful Gods to ever exist. He is unmerciful, abusive and loves to kill anyone who dares cross his path. His appearance was almost human in form, resembling an adult male.</em></p>
<p>Her eyes haphazardly scanned the texts, wanting to read more before a pat on her shoulder disrupted her concentration. She turned her head and saw Rita close to her, her scent engulfing her nostrils. “What are you looking at?”</p>
<p>Amelia blinked and was snapped out of her senses. She sharply looked at the book, and saw it shut closed like it didn’t open at all. The text on the cover was still and unmoving, so unlike what she saw a few seconds ago.</p>
<p><em>What happened? Was I hallucinating?</em></p>
<p>Amelia parted her lips and closed them again, getting her bearings together as she shook her head. “Huh? N-nothing.” She stammered quickly.</p>
