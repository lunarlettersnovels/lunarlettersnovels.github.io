            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 45 – Harvey The Devourer (2)</strong></p>
<p>Amelia didn’t know what transpired between Debra and Rita, but they unanimously decided to go to the forest together, and whoever caught the witch first would take the credit for it. Amelia had no reason to object, and she could also use that opportunity to check whether the elf had left the premises or not.</p>
<p>They divided the knights into teams, and they even made sure they were sufficiently armed with weapons. Some of the guards were also stationed at the Church to patrol the premises. They made sure to spread out the knights as equally as possible to carry out the mission efficiently.</p>
<p>The forest was unnamed, and it was heavily shrouded in gray fog no matter what season it was. Ferocious beasts would appear every now and then, eating people they managed to come across with. With the forest’s daunting reputation, people in that small town avoided the forest at all costs, and overgrown weeds were strewn messily everywhere.</p>
<p>As soon as the group set foot on the forest, they immediately saw a mountain of corpses lying on the ground. The corpses were both from animals and humans alike, and white, brittle bones were scattered around like it had been there for years.</p>
<p>“I wonder how big this monster was.” Rita said, picking up a bone of an unidentified animal with a huge bite mark on it, which was much bigger than a human skull.</p>
<p>“Everyone stay alert. Fall back when you sense something unusual, okay? Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.” Debra said, clenching her wand tightly as she led the group. Bones cracked under their soles as they marched forward deep into the forest.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Harvey the devourer just had the most embarrassing day of his life. Donning two heads, one laying on top of his body, the other, on his chest, he was every bit a monster.</p>
<p>He was someone that could be described as a subtle devourer. He caught people once in a while and eats his meals quietly, not making a mess in the outside world, always leading a happy life in his own little world.</p>
<p>Until an intruder broke into his territory, that is.</p>
<p>Harvey the devourer thought it was unfair. Why did the intruder have to stay on his territory? Why not someone else’s? Not only that, the intruder who was far taller and beautiful than he could ever be, beat him to pulp.</p>
<p>Even though Harvey thought it was unfair, he did not fight back. Luckily, the intruder became indifferent to his pitiful presence and Harvey got away.</p>
<p>Harvey could only clutch his broken limbs to hunt at a much further place.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he ran into a fat and tender kid after walking a few, short steps. Harvey chuckled at the timeliness of it all, and grabbed the crying little boy and ran.</p>
<p>His joy was short-lived, however. After running a few meters with the fat kid on his grasp, he ran into a bunch of people, cornering him as he ceased to a halt. “Stop! Put the kid down!” The woman in front called out.</p>
<p><em>She’s very beautiful</em>, Harvey thought. He hastily pushed the kid away, making the kid fall to the ground as he scrambled away crying. Harvey looked at the woman, licking his lips with a scarlet tongue. “Okay then. You can take the kid’s place. Your meat looks so tender. This is the first time I see such tender-looking meat, and I heard that this is best eaten raw. I will not waste any of it, don’t you worry. I will eat you down to your bones that none of you will be left.”</p>
<p>Saliva dripped from the corner of Harvey’s mouth. Kicking his muscular hind legs, he jumped to the air and rushed towards the girl with a remarkable speed.</p>
<p><em>Nothing like fresh meat mixed with fear. So delicious I could almost taste it.</em></p>
<p>Harvey the devourer grinned, almost salivating at the thought of the fulfilling meal he was about to have.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Still up in the air, Harvey blinked as a long, green strip caught his eyes in a flash. A sound of a heavy object fell to the ground with a loud crash.</p>
<p>It was only then did he realize that it was one of his two heads which fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Holy sh*t! The woman just chopped his head off!</p>
<p>Shocked, Harvey jumped as the huge head bounced on the ground like a ball, and greenish blood oozed out from where he was decapitated.</p>
<p>Instincts kicked in, and Harvey ran maniacally, not bothering to get retrieve his other head lying on the side. He dashed towards the forest in an attempt to escape, but even in his hasty departure, light footsteps still caught up with it as the woman followed close.</p>
<p>Harvey curled his mouth agitatedly in fear. He then maneuvered his direction and ran towards where the intruder, the one who broke into his territory, was located.</p>
<p>What he planned to do was to have both parties kill each other to death. What a brilliant plan!</p>
<p>As he neared close though, his hair was grabbed tight by the woman, and pressed down harshly on the ground. His face was smashed against the soil and dirt, muffling his protests.</p>
<p><em>Come on out, come on out. Weren’t your ears very sensitive when you hit me before? </em>Harvey chanted in his head, wishing for the silver-haired intruder to come out and attack the woman just like what he did to him before.</p>
<p>Harvey tried to crane his head away from the earth and saw a pair of familiar soles from his peripheral vision. <em>It is him!</em></p>
<p>The soles crushed the leaves underneath them, and the honey-colored skin looked dark against the shrubbery.</p>
<p><em>It’s the silver-haired man! He’s here! He and the woman would surely fight each other to death, then it would be a lot easier for me to eat their flesh. How wonderful!</em></p>
<p>Harvey’s eyes widened in sheer excitement.</p>
<p>The hand that was pressing on his head loosened its hold and stood up, walking over to man.</p>
<p>Harvey spat a few times to cleanse his mouth that was full of soil. He slowly crawled towards the shadows, making sure not to draw any attention to himself as he secretly peeped at the two forms.</p>
<p>The woman frowned, walking towards the man with a fierce look etched on her features. The man harbored the same expression too, already meeting the woman halfway as he took step after step. Their difference in height and build was heaven and earth, the woman looked little and weak compared to him.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t look intimidated at all.</p>
<p>Harvey grinned menacingly, revealing a set of pointed teeth where bits of flesh were still stuck inside, enthusiastically waiting for the chaos that was about to unfold.</p>
<p>Only inches away from each other, the woman brutally slapped the man’s head and grabbed him by the ears, pulling him towards her and asked, “Why are you still here?”</p>
<p><em>What? </em>Harvey’s mouth fell open.</p>
