            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 29 – Causing Trouble (2)</strong></p>
<p>The elf looked up in surprise at the sudden intrusion. Amelia’s knuckles went past his cheeks as she fished for the pair of long pointed ears. She gently pinched the soft flesh with her thumb and index finger, and pulled it upwards, making the elf screech.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?!” The elf screamed as he cupped his swollen ears with his palms. His ears felt like it was pulled out of the sides of his head, throbbing in pain.</p>
<p>The sound of crackling flames engulfed his screaming, and only Amelia, who was close to him, was able to hear it.</p>
<p>“Stop pretending. Didn’t you do this? There are no other dark creatures here besides you!” Amelia whispered harshly.</p>
<p>A strong scent of dark magic was up in the air, and he was the lone dark creature inside the room. Who else could be behind this if not him? Could it be that some other dark creature got in?</p>
<p>But this was the place of Light. This place was not a commonplace like that of a market, where anyone can just pass through easily.</p>
<p>She told him to not cause any trouble, and yet here he was, making a mess so big it’s almost impossible to clean up. How infuriating.</p>
<p>The more Amelia thought about it, the angrier she got. The fingers that were clutching on the elf’s sensitive ears twisted brutally. “You better stay down. Cause trouble again, and I will surely teach you a lesson. You’ll see how vicious I am.” Amelia gritted.</p>
<p>Alfonso wanted to bite her fingers off so badly it made him exasperatingly frustrated.</p>
<p>He sat quietly inside Amelia’s pocket. He couldn’t believe that this stupid woman was putting the blame on him all of the sudden!</p>
<p>She was usually quite clever, but the way she’s being dumb right now was so unlike her.</p>
<p>He could only seethed in silence. He couldn’t bear his anger to a minimum as he stood up, wanting to tell Amelia about it when the opening was pulled closed, trapping him inside. He could hear the woman’s fierce voice reverberating from the outside.</p>
<p>Did she really dare teach him a lesson? The elf was so angry he let out a sarcastic laugh. Once he finds out the person behind this, he will crush him to bits and pieces, and throw whatever was left of him right in front of this stupid woman. He’ll make her see how foolish she was.</p>
<p>The fire was growing wilder.</p>
<p>Sweat dripped from everyone’s forehead, and the droplets slid down from the tip of their noses down to their shirts. They were drenched in their own sweat, the heat stinging their skins.</p>
<p>This won’t work. They have to go out right this second. Amelia was about to open her mouth before a flash of fire passed in front of her eyes.</p>
<p>Something huge had fallen!</p>
<p>Before she could think about it, she quickly stretched out her palm, gathering her magic in a swift, claw-like shape, and averted her power towards the burning metal away from the crowd.</p>
<p>“Boom!” A loud noise echoed around them.</p>
<p>Everyone covered their heads in response. They looked at the place where the sound came from, only to find out that a large piece of metal had fallen near above their heads, almost knocking them.</p>
<p>At their feet was a large piece of iron plate, already molten at its sides. It was big enough to crush half of their bodies in a grueling bloodbath.</p>
<p>They were lucky that their lives had been saved. And it was all thanks to…</p>
<p>The saints, who still had fear etched onto their faces, looked at the chief who was hiding at the back.</p>
<p>Amelia saw they were looking at her with a bewildered expression. She gazed at the ceiling, and saw the wood supports almost burnt black. The metal was dangling loosely from the roof, about to fall off any second now.</p>
<p>“There’s no time to waste! Go!” Amelia said sharply, her face stern and full of determination.</p>
<p>“Amelia can you please stop causing trouble at this time! What if someone gets hurt? Would you be held responsible for it?” Debra said angrily.</p>
<p>Amelia stared at Debra fiercely. “Of course.”</p>
<p>She did not bother arguing with Debra. Instead, she focused on the situation at hand, and directed her magic towards the sea of flames as she stretched her hands out, forming a pathway in the middle of the black fire. ”Go!”</p>
<p>Her face was keen, and it was even made more intimidating with the fire burning behind her, casting her features a domineering glow. The crowd hastily followed suit, abiding Amelia’s order and walked out of the burning room.</p>
<p>Debra gritted her teeth, irritated to see how the saints followed Amelia willingly, and left the room after them.</p>
<p>The saints sighed in relief as fresh air hit their faces. Even though they were finally outside, many of them were still in a trance. “What happened? Was it really Amelia that saved us? From what I heard, I thought she’s weak and incapable? Who spread this rumor about her?”</p>
<p>“Her grades are really poor though…” Someone said in a small voice.</p>
<p>“But her magical abilities are exceptionally strong. The pope said so himself. I now understand why she is the chief saint.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes looked at Amelia’s petite and slender form. She had her back facing them, and the blazing fire in front of her. She looked tall and daunting at that very moment, no ounce of fear could be seen in her features.</p>
<p>Amelia went back to see if anyone was still inside. After deeming the place void of people, she breathed a deep sigh, her shoulders drooping down as relief washed over her.</p>
<p>Originally, the little flames would not hurt the saints at all, and it could easily be extinguished. However, with the meddling of someone, who Amelia presumed was none other than Alfonso, the flames grew bolder, which led to the situation they were in right now.</p>
<p><em>‘Great! The church was almost burned to the ground, and people were nearly hurt.’</em></p>
<p>Amelia shook her head disappointedly. She turned her back, about to ask if anyone was hurt when she was met with eyes staring back at her. They were looking at her with eyes full of surprise and reverence. Her heart raced at the sight.</p>
<p>Oh no, did she just expose herself.</p>
