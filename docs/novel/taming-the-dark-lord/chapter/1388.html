            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 36 – The Escapee (1)</strong></p>
<p>“So, where should we start our investigation?”</p>
<p>The three were sitting at the table. Rita sat next to Amelia, and Debra was across them. A plate full of fruits was placed at the center of the table, and Amelia stretched her hand out to pluck a bunch of grapes, eating one after the other.</p>
<p>Debra groaned from her seat. “A bishop named Clemens is stationed here. He is an expert when it comes to courts dealing with heresies, and he’s very efficient at it too. I think it would be best if we ask him, since we are not familiar with this place.”</p>
<p>Amelia nodded, her mouth full of grapes. “That makes sense.”</p>
<p>Rita, on the other hand, hated to see Debra being right. “Can he even help us? Did you forget that the heresy court has always been at odds with the pope? They never see eye to eye. He might be even anticipating seeing us fail this mission.” Rita said.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Everyone is a member of the cult, how could the bishop just sit by and let the witches run away without doing anything?” Debra asked.</p>
<p>Rita crossed her arms, and rolled her eyes exaggeratedly. “Or it might be that he already caught the witches and kept them to himself.”</p>
<p>Debra slammed the table with her palms, already fed up with Rita’s baseless insinuations. “How can you say that! You—“</p>
<p>“Okay, okay calm down.” Amelia suddenly spoke, wanting to diffuse the tense atmosphere between the two. “How about we just go, and find out for ourselves? Then we’ll decide whether to ask for the bishop’s help or not, okay?”</p>
<p>The two had always been at each other’s necks, and it intensified even more when Debra made Rita’s past public— the one that Rita spent most of her life hiding. Since then, the two have become sworn enemies, making each other feel inferior every chance they get.</p>
<p>They even fight about the most mundane matters, never letting one another breathe without a snide or two. Debra’s usual holy and gentle expression was long gone, replaced by a seething front in its place.</p>
<p>Rita snorted in response. She raised her proud yet beautiful face, and glanced at Debra spitefully. “I’d rather listen to our chief, not to someone who is far from being one, and yet acting like she’s the one in charge.” Rita said as she cocked her head to the side, and added mockingly. “It’s funny how you think so highly of yourself.”</p>
<p>Debra’s jaw tightened, and closed her fists so hard her nails marked her palms. Amelia, who was sitting between the two, quickly pulled Rita away, and prevented her from saying more.</p>
<p>They arrived in front of the local branch mounted on a carriage. The town was barren, void of any life but for the religious buildings that stood luxuriously. The roads were inlaid with white jade, the windows bright and squeaky clean, and all of its grandeur was prominent amidst the dullness of its surroundings.</p>
<p>The carriage halted in front of the Church.</p>
<p>Amelia gripped the handrail as she walked down the steps, her eyes looking around in sheer amazement. “Wow, it’s so grand.”</p>
<p>In front of the doors stood a few people who came to pay their respects and worship. They were dressed in ragged clothes, and a few patches were stitched to cover the holes. As they knelt on the opulent white jade floor, the contrast between the wealthy and the poor were emphasized greatly, overwhelmingly different from one another.</p>
<p>Rita followed Amelia’s line of sight and agreed. “It really is beautiful. Let’s tell our superiors about this, and ask them to change the flooring like this one.” She said as she tapped the white floor with her soles.</p>
<p>It was still early in the morning, and Bishop Clemens had yet to wake up. The maid escorted them to a waiting room, telling them to make themselves comfortable and left to rouse the bishop from his slumber.</p>
<p>Several minutes passed, and the bishop was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Rita couldn’t stand it any longer. “What’s taking him so long?” She fumed angrily as she stood up from her seat, “Why is he making us wait?”</p>
<p>Debra frowned and exhaled a deep breath. “Let’s ask the maid to call him again—“</p>
<p><strong>Bang!</strong></p>
<p>Before Debra could finish her words, the door of the waiting room suddenly burst open, making the three saints jump in surprise.</p>
<p>The door revealed a pale-looking maid, and her eyes were wide as saucers. “My Lord!” She exclaimed, her whole body trembling with obvious fright. “Master Bishop seems to be dead! I called for him for a long time but he didn’t respond. And when I entered his chambers, I saw his blood all over the place!” The maid cried hysterically.</p>
<p>Amelia and Debra abruptly stood up from their seats. The three Saints looked at each other, stunned into silence as they hurriedly followed the maid towards the Bishop’s room.</p>
<p>When they reached the room, the saints gasped in unison, horrified at the scene laid before them.</p>
