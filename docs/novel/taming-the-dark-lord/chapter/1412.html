            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 12 – Crafted by Gods (1)</strong></p>
<p>Amelia gasped internally. She knew that she was finished.</p>
<p>If she goes to the Holy Ceremony, and sees the God of light in person, the supreme being would definitely see the false Saint that she is, and she would be banished right on the spot.</p>
<p>Should she make a run for it? Maybe she could turn around, and run as far as she could.</p>
<p>It seemed like she’s going to die either way. Whether she stays or not, the outcome would be pretty much the same.</p>
<p>Amelia closed her eyes tightly, her anxiety increasing tenfold.</p>
<p>She felt a heavy metal perch on her head. The Pope had removed his crown and placed it on Amelia. The meter-long scepter was also pushed into her hand, shining brightly against her trembling hands.</p>
<p>The crown, the scepter &amp; the garment; all of it was in Amelia’s possession.</p>
<p>The Pope draped the robe over her shoulders, and Amelia, who was still staring blankly, slid her arms through the sleeves obediently. Closing the buttons and adjusting the crown on her head, the Pope smiled at Amelia’s form with his hands on her shoulders. He turned around, formally announcing to the public that Amelia was this year’s newest Pope.</p>
<p>The Saints bowed down in reverence, chanting. “Congratulations to the new Pope!”</p>
<p>Amelia gazed at the crowd before her, and she noticed that some of the Saints were looking at her with eyes full of disdain. It was expected though, since the Saints have all dedicated their days to becoming the Pope, and yet there’s Amelia, who didn’t try at all. She quickly remembered where she was, glancing towards the Pope as she bowed fully.</p>
<p>From a distance, Amelia glimmered mesmerizingly with her ensemble on, which was more emphasized by her golden, blonde tresses.</p>
<p>As if stabbed in the chest, Debra closed her eyes and willed back her tears. Her mouth quivered slightly as she bit at her lips, trying to keep her emotions at bay.</p>
<p>One of the Saints approached her from the back. “Debra, don’t be sad. Come on.” She rubbed Debra’s back as she continued. “She may be the Pope now, but don’t forget that you are still better than her. She’s not even half as good as you. How could they even choose Amelia to read the Scriptures?”</p>
<p>The Saint pulled back, and whispered. “She’s just there as a stepping stone you’ll need to deal with. You are far more worthy of the Pope’s crown than her.”</p>
<p>Debra pondered on what her friend said. She knew deep in her heart that no one deserves it more than her, and everyone thought so too. The Pope himself favored her the most out of everyone, until today.</p>
<p>Admittedly, she was aware of her mistake, but wasn’t that a harmless one? It was only done against Rita, not anyone else. Why was it such a big deal? Did the Pope really forget her years of service, just because of one simple mistake?</p>
<p>Debra would use this opportunity to make them all see that no one should preside the Millennium Scripture but her. She scoffed to herself, too deep into her thoughts to pay any attention to the ongoing ceremony.</p>
<p>The ceremony lasted for several hours, and Amelia was not able to escape until nighttime.</p>
<p>Sighing as she went out of the Church, she came across a familiar Knight standing a few paces away from her room. He was not wearing a helmet, and Amelia noted that he had a particularly handsome face. He knelt down in front of Amelia and bowed his head. “Pope.”</p>
<p>Amelia was not in the best mood, but she couldn’t let anyone see her dispirited expression as she forced herself to keep a straight face. “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>The Knights of the inspection team were solely assigned for the external patrols, and they were not allowed to enter this place without permission.</p>
<p>The Knight got up. “It’s about the latest massacre. My subordinates found some clues, and I am going to report it to the archbishop.”</p>
<p>Latest massacre?</p>
<p>Amelia grew silent. She suddenly remembered the situation earlier that led her to the elf.  “What did you find out?” She asked.</p>
<p>“I followed the trace near Oya street, but when I got there, it disappeared.”</p>
<p><em>Oya Street. Why is that so familiar?</em></p>
<p>Too tired with today’s festivities, Amelia didn’t think too much of it, shrugging it off her mind. She turned around and nodded. “Alright. You should go, don’t keep the Archbishop waiting.”</p>
<p>Amelia proceeded along the path, walking a few steps before she halted. Full realization seeped into her mind, freezing her on her tracks.</p>
<p>Oya street was the place where she met the dark elf!</p>
<p>And Amelia knew that it’s not a coincidence.</p>
<p>Was someone else at the alley with them? Was someone hiding in the corners, and saw Amelia save the dark elf, when she should have killed it right away?</p>
<p>And could a dark mage know of this?</p>
<p>Amelia felt goosebumps run up her spine down to her arms. Her heartbeat thumping against her chest, sweat forming on her forehead as panic overtook her body. She breathed deeply, willing herself to calm down.</p>
<p>She would have felt the presence of a dark creature lurking in the background, she was sure of it. Though she didn’t enjoy studying about it, she would still be able to sense it if it really was there.</p>
<p>It was downright impossible for her not to notice. She also made sure the road was empty before moving the elf.</p>
<p>Amelia convinced herself to believe her own narrative. She continued on, walking fast towards her palace.</p>
