            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 33 – Warm and Pleasant Personality</strong></p>
<p>Amelia smiled. She gathered her hands behind her back and waited patiently for the elf to finish the book.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this?” The elf suddenly came out of the room. His slender body leaned against the wall, and his voice was a little hoarse, as if he had just woken up as he looked at her blankly. He was in his natural form now, a grown man, his silver hair was carelessly brush away from his face.</p>
<p>“It’s the introduction about elves. They were explained quite clearly in the book. The elves are divided into two: spirit elves, and dark elves. The spirit elves are isolated from the world, and they never appear. While the dark elves lives in the dark realm, and they use the tribe as the link—“</p>
<p>“That’s not what I’m asking about.” He cut Amelia off as he held the book in front of her and pointed to a specific line. “I’m asking about this paragraph.”</p>
<p>Amelia grabbed the book, and read the line the elf was pointing at. “Oh. This part was enumerating the dark elves’ usual habits. They love to clean, to work, and it is said that they have a warm and friendly personality. What they enjoy the most doing is to sneak into people’s homes, and help them clean.”</p>
<p>“Rich people would even raise one or two dark elves in their homes, and refer to them as house elves.” Amelia added.</p>
<p>“Lackey, do you really think that I’m that stupid?” The elf scorned. “Did you really think that I would believe such stupidity?”</p>
<p>Amelia smiled mockingly and placed the book on the cupboard. “How about we ask the others then? Since you don’t believe me? It just so happens that I’m heading out, do you want to join me?”</p>
<p>The elf narrowed his eyes, warily looking at Amelia as he sized her up and down. He plastered a smile on his face. “Okay. Let’s see what tricks you’re trying to pull.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In the quad in front of the Church, Rita and Debra stood waiting a few feet away from each other.</p>
<p>Rita felt relieved as soon as she saw Amelia walking towards them. She walked a few steps closer, and met Amelia halfway. “You’re finally here. I don’t really want to be alone with her.” Rita said as she subtly nudged Amelia by the arm, prompting Amelia to glance at Debra.</p>
<p>“What happened to her?” Amelia asked.</p>
<p>Rita curled her lips. “She said that she didn’t sleep well last night. But who knows? I bet she was so angry she cried herself to sleep.” Rita chuckled.</p>
<p>Debra, who had always been confident and sure of herself, was now reduced to a disheveled mess. How she appeared right now was the exact opposite of the Debra they all knew.</p>
<p>“Uh… I don’t think crying yourself to sleep would actually lead to this.” Amelia countered.</p>
<p>Looking at Debra, Amelia almost suspected that she was taking prohibited drugs. Her cheeks that used to be plump had deflated like a balloon, sunken and hollow as if she’s been starved for months. Her eyes were bloodshot, and the bags under her eyes looked twice in size.</p>
<p>When the Pope arrived, he called the three over, and his attention immediately focused on Debra. “Debra, what’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>Debra rubbed her eyes with the back of her palms. “Pope Highness, it’s not a big deal. It’s just that I didn’t sleep well, that’s all.”</p>
<p>Debra herself was shocked upon seeing her reflection that morning. Did she stay up way too late to study last night? She found herself lying on the floor, so that must be the reason why she looked so ghastly.</p>
<p><em>‘I shouldn’t stay up that late again.’ </em>Debra thought as she stifled a yawn.</p>
<p>“Good to hear that you’re alright.” The Pope nodded at Debra before averting his gaze at Amelia. “There are updates from the Knights guarding the city. They found the two witches who had escaped. They found them hiding in a small town nearby.”</p>
<p>“Amelia, as the chief, you didn’t do a good job guarding these two heretics. Although I’m crediting you for having saved the others, you are still responsible for this. Do prepare yourself and set off in the next few days. Bring them back here, do you understand?” The Pope said.</p>
<p>With the Pope looking at her scrutinizingly, Amelia had no choice but to bow her head in reply. “Yes, I will do as you say, Pope Highness.”</p>
<p>The Pope turned to face Debra and Rita. “You two should go with Amelia, especially you, Rita. You need to get some merits so everyone could see that you are worthy of staying in the cult, and that my decision for letting you stay was not wrong.”</p>
<p>Rita’s eyes were instantly filled with tears after hearing the Pope’s words. “Yes, Pope Highness.” Debra also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Debra looked frail, and it was a pretty disturbing sight, making the Pope frown in response. “Debra, come with me.”</p>
<p>After the two left the area, Rita jumped up and down excitedly as she shook Amelia’s shoulders. “Ahhh! I’m so thrilled! The Pope is so kind, he’s actually giving me another chance to redeem myself!” Rita squeaked continuously.</p>
<p>When her excitement finally simmered down, Amelia unintentionally asked her, “Rita, do you know anything about house elves?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Rita replied nonchalantly. She was still quite fidgety. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>Amelia glanced at the bulging little cloth bag she pinned on her waist, which held Alfonso in miniature size inside. “I just can’t remember what we call them.”</p>
<p>“The dark elves, you mean? How could you forget?” Rita asked, her eyebrows squeezed together, as if she couldn’t believe Amelia had really forgotten.</p>
<p>Amelia let out a yawn as she stretched her arms in front of her. “I guessed that slipped my mind. You head back first, I still have something to attend to.”</p>
<p>After Rita left, Amelia pulled the small cloth bag near her face as she whispered to the elf. “What do you think?”</p>
<p>Alfonso gritted his teeth. “That can’t be right.”</p>
<p><em>‘How ridiculous. Love for cleaning? Warm and pleasant personality? Oh please. She was fooling no one.’ </em>The elf thought.</p>
<p><em>‘He was really hard to fool, huh?’</em> Amelia suddenly pulled a black satin handkerchief from her pocket. She opened the cloth, and in the very center of the hanky, a few white crumbs were stuck in it. And when one looked at it from a distance, it looked like a night that was full of stars.</p>
<p>Alfonso’s pupils darkened at the implication. His eyes were murderous, and he was about to cast his whip, wanting to rip the handkerchief apart.</p>
<p>Amelia laughed teasingly, her laughter drilling right into the elf’s ears. “Don’t you feel like cleaning up these white crumbs?” She waved the handkerchief in front of the elf’s face. “Since you really enjoy cleaning?”</p>
<p>Amelia laughed maniacally, amused by her own joke.</p>
