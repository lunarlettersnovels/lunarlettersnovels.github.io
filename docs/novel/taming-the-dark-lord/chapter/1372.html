            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 52 – My Dear Daughter (1)</strong></p>
<p>“What should we do?” Debra whimpered, adjusting Amelia’s arm as it slipped dangerously low from her shoulders.</p>
<p>Amelia had never been closer to death than she was right now in the two decades of her life. The thought was just too much to handle, and even if she kept on healing herself, the wound still got bigger and bigger each time. It corroded her flesh red and oozed out blood and pus, like it dented her skin down to her bones, draining her strength and the remaining energy that she had.</p>
<p>It was just useless.</p>
<p>And she was so tired.</p>
<p>“Let me go.”</p>
<p>It would be a lot better if one of them gets to live than both of them dying together. Although dying young was not part of her plan, no one would be able to avenge them if Debra died alongside her.</p>
<p>“Let me go.” She repeated, her pale face showing a small smile. She pulled her arm out from Debra’s clutch.</p>
<p>Debra had an idea where Amelia’s getting at. She despised her, right? She should be happy that Amelia herself took the initiative to raise such an uncomfortable matter. It was nothing but necessary, given the situation they were in.</p>
<p>Amelia thought that Debra would make a run for it now that she gave her a chance to, but she didn’t. What Debra did instead was she grabbed Amelia’s hand again and held it so tightly Amelia’s skin turned white. “Do you think that I’m that shallow?” Debra said with tears in her eyes, “Do you think that I’m so weak that I’d leave my companion behind?”</p>
<p>The façade Debra always plastered on her face finally broke, replaced by a genuine one in its place— and it was clear as day.</p>
<p>“Hear me out, Amelia. You’re not the only one who is righteous and kind. If you can do it, I can too! I’ll never lose to you!”</p>
<p>Debra was still competitive as ever, even in the strange circumstances they were currently in.</p>
<p>Amelia wanted to laugh at the saint’s untimely remark, but her tears beat her to it. She sniffled and wiped her tears with the back of her hand. She held Debra’s hand, and told her reassuringly, “If that’s the case, I will hold onto you even if I die later.”</p>
<p>Debra snorted at the unexpected response. “Nah, you better keep your hands off me.”</p>
<p>Amelia couldn’t help but smile. She didn’t expect that they would share a sincere friendship, during an attack at that, too. From the hand where she was held, there seemed to be a force that flowed to her body that made her forget the throbbing pain she was feeling. She followed the footsteps of her companion soundlessly and unstoppingly.</p>
<p>As they go hand in hand together, time appears to be going by faster and swifter.</p>
<p>Their never-ending escape had finally neared its end, the Church was already at the next turn.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to turn though, the footsteps behind them got closer too, as if it took numerous steps at a time to keep up with the saints’ brusque pace, like the necromancer finally decided to end the cat and mouse game he’s playing at.</p>
<p>In their agility and steadfastness, the speed the two saints’ were in suddenly screeched to a halt.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Amelia and Debra panted, and looked straight at the skinny witch who was now standing in front of the Church. What was she doing there? Isn’t she supposed to be strapped on the torture device in the basement?</p>
<p>The skinny witch stood dazedly on the steps. Her wounds were still pronounced as ever, clothes still smeared with red and dirtied blood. She was looking at the Saints through her disheveled hair with a pair of bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>“What does she want? How did she get out?” Debra asked anxiously.</p>
<p>The necromancer was only a dozen steps away from them. He was looking at them with a smile etched on his face, like he was anticipating getting his boney hands on them.</p>
<p>And the only way for Amelia and Debra to get out of this alive was blocked by the witch, who was looking forward to the saints’ demise.</p>
<p>They were trapped on both sides; wolves at the front, tigers at the back. And Debra was dragging an injured Amelia, too, who was also on the brink of death.</p>
<p>She wanted to cry.</p>
<p>“What do you want?” Amelia croaked, looking at the witch as she regained her breathing.</p>
<p>To their surprise, the witch stepped out of the way, an unmistakable gesture of permitting them entrance. “Go in.” The witch said hoarsely.</p>
<p>Amelia was stunned. She stared at the witch, gauging to see if there’s an underlying malice behind those two words. After an unspoken understanding between the two, she quickly dragged Debra and charged towards the Church.</p>
