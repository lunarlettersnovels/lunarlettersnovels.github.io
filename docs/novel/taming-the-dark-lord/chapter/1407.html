            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 17 – Regret (2)</strong></p>
<p>Amelia abruptly stood up just as the knight came back with a cup of tea in one hand, and a snack in the other. She rushed out quickly, informing the knight of the sudden change of plans. “There’s something I need to take care of. I will come back tomorrow to talk in full detail.” She stammered hastily as she went out of the building.</p>
<p>Running to her place, Amelia wondered who would come visit her so unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Only a few people would take the initiative to come seeking for her, since even in her crowning moment, her popularity among the Saints was still quite pretty average.</p>
<p>From a distance, Amelia saw a familiar figure standing at the gate outside her palace. Amelia stopped as she voiced out questioningly. “Rita?”</p>
<p>Rita, who had always been the epitome of confidence and grace, turned her head shyly, as if she was embarrassed to be there. She was obviously troubled, her face looking so stressed out as she bowed her head low.</p>
<p>“Amelia.” Rita said, fisting her dress tightly before continuing. “Please help me. I ask this of you. No one even dares to look in my direction, much less help me. You’re the only one who can help me right now. I can’t leave this place on my own. Please.” Rita begged silently.</p>
<p>Rita fell on the ground, kneeling in front of Amelia as she pleaded continuously. It looks like she’s about to faint at any moment now, her face pale as a ghost.</p>
<p>When she was exposed that day, the Pope did not even spare a glance at Rita, ignoring her as if she didn’t exist, her years of hard work evaporating into thin air.  What the Pope did instead was he sent in a bishop to Rita, the bishop telling her on his behalf that she had to leave the Church as soon as possible, and preferably within the week.</p>
<p>Rita was an illegitimate daughter, not recognized by anyone in the society. She tried her best to become a Saint, but now that she was expelled, no one would really take her in anymore, not even her family. They would leave her to die if the situation called for it.</p>
<p>Others laughed, and snickered so cruelly at Rita’s demise, so she couldn’t come to any of them for help. Amelia was her last and only hope.</p>
<p>Amelia hesitated, not wanting to get into trouble by aiding Rita in her escape. But when she looked into the latter’s eyes glinting with hope, Amelia’s heart softened immediately, sighing as she acquiesced.</p>
<p>“Where you came from is not the problem. That’s something you can’t change anymore, but you can still redeem yourself. You have to make amends.” Amelia said shortly.</p>
<p>Rita rubbed her arm soothingly, taking in what Amelia said. Pondering deeply on her short yet profound words, Rita’s eyes glowed in understanding. She had a clear idea of what Amelia was trying to say.</p>
<p>Rita’s abilities were good, which is why she was regarded as one of the best Saints in their class. She had been too busy focusing on her illegitimacy that she forgot to think about the more significant matters. Hearing Amelia’s sound advice snapped her to her senses.</p>
<p>Rita bowed towards Amelia, a blatant gesture of her appreciation. “Thank you for not turning me away and for giving me such advice. I am grateful.”</p>
<p>Amelia nodded. Rita then straightened her back and threw Amelia a small smile before walking away. When Rita was completely out of sight, Amelia opened the gates and went inside.</p>
<p>She rummaged through the cupboard, looking at its’ contents as she took out a pack of soft bread and a small fruit jam. She placed it on the tray on the counter, and lifted it as she made her way towards the basement.</p>
<p>Prying the door open with her shoulder, she went inside the room, and saw the dark elf in a curled position. She looked around the small space, thinking where to put the tray down.</p>
<p>If Amelia didn’t see the elf move around earlier from her screen, she would most probably think that he was still weak. But she knew that the elf had already regained his energy back since he was roaming around earlier on his own accord.</p>
<p>Amelia scoffed, placing the tray on the table as she spoke sternly. “Get up and eat.”</p>
<p>She had so many things running on her mind, and it was beyond exasperating to bottle it all up with no one to vent to.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the massacre that day, she would’ve never been in this big mess she was currently in. She thought about everything that led her into this cumbersome situation.</p>
<p>Still thinking deeply, she realized that no one would’ve helped the little elf that was covered in scars and blood besides her. No sane person would dare lend a helping a hand over a dark creature.</p>
<p>Amelia’s forehead scrunched together, coming to a conclusion that all this happened because she decided to help the elf. Frustrated, she even thought that maybe the elf intentionally made himself small so someone like her would take pity on him. What a great pretender, and Amelia couldn’t believe she fell right into his trap!</p>
<p>The dark elf felt Amelia’s sudden change of mood, squinting at her mockingly. “What’s wrong with you? Did you drink something bitter? Like a medicine gone bad, perhaps?”</p>
