            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 66 – Antics</strong></p>
<p>Amelia lost all her color upon realizing that Alfonso was no longer inside her pocket. She was about to go berserk finding him when suddenly, she heard a mischievous sound.</p>
<p>She could hear a faint chuckling sound directly to her ear, prompting her to turn her head and saw the elf’s reflection through a mirror on the side. He was hiding beneath her tresses, and Amelia was relieved that the elf didn’t wander off. However, her relief was immediately replaced with anger as realization crept in. She wondered when the elf got out, and what was he doing exactly? They were inside the Church and there’s a big chance that people might see him!</p>
<p>Since she was still in Rita’s embrace, she couldn’t really reach out for him lest Rita sees, and all she could was stare at the elf’s reflection, threatening him with her eyes as she beckoned him to get back inside her bag.</p>
<p>The elf only laughed in response and said no, shaking his head in disobedience. His voice sounded low beside her ears, bringing a shiver down Amelia’s spine as she was rattled from the inside out.</p>
<p>Heat blossomed on her face and she was exceptionally flustered from the elf’s antics. She hurriedly broke free from Rita’s clutch, quickly telling her that there’s something she needed to do before the ritual started as an excuse.</p>
<p>She ran out and found a mirror, trying to catch the uncooperative elf who kept fumbling and skittering inside her mass of hair, fully entertained by the sight of her reddened ears. He managed to escape Amelia’s grasps and it infuriated her to the core as she threw a fit right on the spot.</p>
<p>The elf snickered triumphantly, and Amelia wanted to wipe the smirk off his face. “Just you wait.” She gritted through her teeth.</p>
<p>The others were waiting for her to get the ritual started, and she went to the prayer room to prepare everything what’s needed for the Ceremony.</p>
<p>The Ceremony to ask God himself was the Light cult’s method in identifying magic, and making use of it costs a lot of money, and only people from noble families could afford it. Also, only a handful of people were willing to cast spells for civilians, too.</p>
<p>The red-haired girl was moved to tears, her eyes bleary as she willed herself to calm down. She kept taking sly glances at the girl standing in front of her, grateful for having been shown mercy and kindness.</p>
<p>Rita bit her lips. Various thoughts filled her head and she wished that Amelia arrived a little bit later, when the two witches were already burned to death just so the bet between the two would be withdrawn, and Debra then would have no chance in being the next Chief.</p>
<p>Rita lived to see Debra being disappointed.</p>
<p>Were the two, accused girls innocent? Debra didn’t care at all. It wasn’t something she’s bothered with, and nothing was more important to her than Amelia maintaining her position as Chief.</p>
<p>The people had their attention focused solely on the Ceremony happening before them, and they could see white, glowing circles under the red-haired girl, a clear indication that she was pure and innocent, and far from being a witch.</p>
<p>Rita smiled in satisfaction. The crowd breathed a sigh of relief, the intensity of the atmosphere simmering down.</p>
<p>There’s only the black-haired girl left, who was silent the whole time. They’ve been through so much, going hand in hand together as they went through life’s obstacles. Escaping the torture room was by far the most heart-racing thing they ever did, and standing at the center of the circle was just nerve racking.</p>
<p>Magic was chanted, and a light flashed around them.</p>
<p>A pitch-black halo with fiery reds appeared around her, the colors so menacing it could only mean one thing. The crowd gasped, and hearing the chatters of the onlookers made the girl lift her head up as her mouth curved upwards, a despicable light shining around her.</p>
<p>“Bella?! You?!” The red-haired girl cried, she didn’t expect that her friend was indeed a witch.</p>
<p>The black-haired girl named Bella scoffed, and a black book suddenly materialized on her hands, the pages flipping so maddeningly that everyone took a step back, and it appeared as if it was endless. Amelia stepped forward, and saw three strange characters written on the pages like an omen.</p>
<p>She hadn’t seen these words for quite a long time, but Amelia felt that she knew what the characters meant. The gears in her head turned as she tried to recall where she saw it, and after a few lingering seconds, she was abruptly reminded of the elf’s dark skin, which the three, strange words represented.</p>
