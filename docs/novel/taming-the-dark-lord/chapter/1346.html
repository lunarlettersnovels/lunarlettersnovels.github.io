            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 78 – Rivalry</strong></p>
<p>It was a bright sunny day, with wisps of air breezing by making the leaves shake from their branches. People were shuffling as they prepared to set out for departure. Carriages were parked neatly outside, and servants skittered back and forth preoccupied with stuffing their things inside the compartment. The skinny witch was shackled as she was escorted inside a wagon solely made for prisoners.</p>
<p>Everyone was out and about, but Amelia stood underneath the shades of trees away from the glaring sun. She shielded her eyes with one hand, watching the commotion before her as she waited for the convoy to set forth.</p>
<p>“Why do you have two purses?” Rita raised her eyebrow seeing Amelia carrying two bags. One black and one white. It was both hung on her waist, but situated at the opposite ends of her hipbones that looked really odd.</p>
<p>Amelia lowered her head sheepishly and flashed Rita a shy smile. “Don’t you think it’s pretty fashionable of me?”</p>
<p>Rita blinked at Amelia’s remark, unsure what to say as she said hesitatingly, “Really?”</p>
<p><em>Of course not!</em></p>
<p>Amelia sighed to herself. Last night, two angry elves fussed around as they incessantly tore at each other: One stretched his limbs to gash the other’s paw with his nails, and the other fisted Amelia’s skirt making his nemesis much angrier than he already was.</p>
<p>They were at each other’s necks the whole night, only stopping when Amelia fumingly screamed at them that they ceased to a halt. It was already dawn by then, and the sun was already peeking on the horizon.</p>
<p>It was a ‘blessing’ no ordinary person could enjoy. She sighed once again and poked the black bag with her prodding fingers.</p>
<p>The black bag was motionless, as if there was nothing inside.</p>
<p>Alfonso had yet to speak to Amelia, remaining unspeaking ever since Amelia decided to bring the white elf with them. He was so angry that he gave her the silent treatment and proceeded to ignore her completely.</p>
<p>Amelia huffed at the dark elf’s way of throwing a tantrum. She looked at the bag and said, “I haven’t talked to my dark elf ever since last night. I feel so lonely.” She made sure she sounded sad to get his attention.</p>
<p>The black bag shifted for a fraction of a second, barely moved by her words.</p>
<p>Amelia went on, “It would be great if he would talk to me. I feel so sad. I don’t feel like doing anything because he keeps on ignoring me. What should I do? I’m not even in the mood to eat anymore.”</p>
<p>The tone of her words almost came out as a whine. Well, she really did try to sound pitiful as to lure Alfonso to talking to her. Sure enough, a sharp ‘hmph’ sound resonated from the bag as soon as her words fell.</p>
<p>Amelia grinned at her successful attempt. She turned her back from prying eyes and took the dark elf out of her bag. She combed the tips of his silver hair with her fingers. “Don’t be mad anymore, okay?” She assuaged, affection lacing her voice.</p>
<p>Alfonso didn’t steer away from her touch, only looking at her with seething eyes and said, “Throw that thing away.”</p>
<p>“That thing” he was referring to was none other than the white elf.</p>
<p>Amelia’s hand softly brushed the tip of his soft ears, making it seem like it was unintentional. He looked so adorable when she reduced him to this ridiculously small size for him to fit inside her pouch.</p>
<p>“It won’t take long going to the next city and we will be arriving sometime in the afternoon. What should we eat while we’re on route? Fruit or rice?”</p>
<p>Alfonso slapped her hand away from his ears. He stared at her hard and repeated his words with a heavy tongue. “Throw it away.”</p>
<p>Amelia groaned, realizing that the elf wouldn’t let this slip just as she helplessly hoped. “Didn’t I tell you that the slave owner left the same day we got him? I can’t send him back anymore. What do you want me to do? He has a mark on his body, indicating that he’s a slave and he wouldn’t survive if I leave him on his own.”</p>
<p>The dark elf’s lips were pressed thinly. He wanted to tell her to just let him die but decided against it, couldn’t bring himself to utter the words out seeing the concern behind her gentle eyes.</p>
<p>Amelia really was a good person. She did rescue the dark elf after all, not even sure if he was alive or not, and she was also putting up with Debra’s antics all the time, so placing the white elf under her protection was not surprising at the least.</p>
<p>Not only that, the white elf also matched Amelia’s kind, unlike Alfonso who is a dark elf. The only light about him was his silvery hair and even that seemed cunning, looking like a dead man’s bones so far from the luster of a white jade.</p>
<p>Alfonso gazed downwards, sitting quietly atop the woman’s palm. He remained quiet as the desire to kill slowly stirred in his chest.</p>
<p>Even if he was with her for quite some time now, he still couldn’t understand her inclination towards anything that was of the Light cult. It doesn’t matter, though. He would teach her patiently one step at a time.</p>
<p>But the irritating white elf has to die.</p>
<p>Amelia felt a slight chill on her palms, surprised as she whispered, “Alfonso? Are you—“</p>
<p>“Hey Amelia!” Someone called after her, cutting her off midsentence. “Come on! Why are you still standing there? Let’s go!” The voice yelled shout after shout.</p>
<p>Rita waved, frantically beckoning her towards the carriage. Amelia looked around her surroundings, and noticed that she was the only one standing outside, and all of the others were already seated inside their carriages.</p>
<p>She snapped to her senses and quickly stuffed the elf inside her chest pocket and hurriedly ran to the carriage waiting for her. It seemed like she wasn’t completely aware of what she did exactly, and Alfonso jolted upon feeling the softness of Amelia’s skin.</p>
