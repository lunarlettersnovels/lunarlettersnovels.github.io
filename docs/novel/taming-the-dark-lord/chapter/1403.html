            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 21 – I Was Wrong (2)</strong></p>
<p>Amelia shook her head frantically, quickly explaining. “It’s not that at all. I was just afraid that you would be caught.”</p>
<p>Her words didn’t convince him at all. And if anything, the elf only grew much angrier with what she said. Amelia gulped, and she realized that no matter what she said, it wouldn’t matter since he was already aggravated for the mere fact that she was part of the Light cult.</p>
<p>“The running dog of the old thief of light. I will kill you.” The elf seethed.</p>
<p>Instead of bringing his tentacles out from the shadows, the elf produced a thin, light whip from his fingertips, which had the power to break the ground in half. He waved the whip in front of Amelia, producing a crisp sound as it sloshed the air.</p>
<p>Amelia stepped back, and avoided the brandishing of the elf’s whip. “You’re making too much noise! You’re attracting people to go here!”</p>
<p>The elf sneered. “Isn’t that what you want? Didn’t you want to hand me over to your cult?”</p>
<p>Amelia hesitated for a moment. “You… How do you know?”</p>
<p>He did not say anything and only looked at Amelia, raising his hand to wave the whip once again. Then, he yanked the whip down, hitting the ground with brute force that it caused fissures onto the earth.</p>
<p>Seeing him violent made Amelia furious. Unable to control her frustrations any longer, she spoke accusingly. “You were alone in that alley that day, you said so yourself. Who else was with you?”</p>
<p>With the sudden query, the dark elf frowned. Didn’t he make himself clear already? Dealing with this woman was already wearing him out. “I told you. I don’t remember anything!”</p>
<p>He screeched venomously, his whip growing much faster and swifter. Amelia eventually lost her grip, and doubts started to fill up her mind. However, when all his energy was spent, he was still wounded and was still recovering.</p>
<p>Maybe he lived for many years, and his hands were stained with countless blood.</p>
<p>Was it really just a coincidence that a strong man, who was seriously injured, appeared right at the corner not far from where the massacre took place?</p>
<p>The more she thought about it, the more vivid it got. She could imagine how the dark elves stood watching, encircling the mass of corpses as they laughed menacingly at the gruel sight. Amelia shivered at the thought.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, there’s no use wasting her time here.</p>
<p>She flicked her wrist, and thrust the machete to her waist. She concentrated, and drew the dark line that was previously buried inside the man.</p>
<p>A magic wave rippled out and spread throughout his whole body. <em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>He stood immobile in his spot and fell face down onto the earth.</p>
<p>Amelia let out a sigh of relief. Fortunately, she placed something on the dark elf before she went to sleep. She did it as a precaution for her own safety. Otherwise she wouldn’t be able to win against him, should they have a serious fight.</p>
<p>Amelia crouched down before the elf, and glared at him. “Don’t try to fight it.”</p>
<p>He was left unmoving, and his eyes were full of hate, like he wanted to stab her to death. Amelia paid him no mind and decided to stop wasting her words to persuade him. She stood up, encircling him slowly, staring intently at his form as she did so.</p>
<p>From her peripheral vision, her eyes caught sight of a figure moving towards her direction. It was a knight, and it seemed like he’s patrolling this area.</p>
<p>Amelia panicked. She quickly took the elf and hid him behind the shrubbery, and used magic to conceal the mess on the road.</p>
<p>The knight shuffled towards her as soon as she’s done cleaning the place.</p>
<p>“Pope?” The knight called out. He was surprised to see Amelia standing there in the middle of the night. She looked like a ghost especially with her long, white dress.</p>
<p>“It’s me.” Amelia said as she flicked the grass that was stuck to her dress. “I couldn’t sleep, so I came out to have a look.”</p>
<p>The knight nodded and bowed his head low, avoiding Amelia’s soft, white chest.</p>
<p>“Do continue on your patrols. Don’t worry about me.” Amelia said as her eyes peered over the bush where the elf was hidden. She prayed that the unruly elf wouldn’t make any sound.</p>
<p>“Yes.” The knight nodded and walked past Amelia. He was about to turn into a corner when he turned back again, and whispered. “Pope, we have new clues about the massacre. A feather of an eagle was spotted on one of the corpses, and traces of it were also detected on the wound. We guess that it was the hawks that killed the civilians.”</p>
<p><em>‘What?’</em></p>
<p>Amelia did not move, completely taken aback by the information. The knight saluted, and walked out of the area to resume his nightly patrols.</p>
<p>After standing there for a long time, Amelia went to the edge of the bush, and pushed the leaves out her way as her eyes caught sight of the beautiful elf’s scarlet orbs. She humbly said, “I was wrong.”</p>
