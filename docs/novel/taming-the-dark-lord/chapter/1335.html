            <p><strong>Chapter 89 – Outnumbered (1)</strong></p>
<p>What a ridiculous idea. But she was left with no choice. She needed to go there and find out for herself even though the city where they dueled on was a bit far away. It’s going to take her a couple of days at most, but fortunately for Amelia, she found a magic carpet lying unused inside the warehouse and decided to fly there with Alfonso.</p>
<p>The rain ceased after its onslaught that went on for hours. The mist fogged the whole area as the city slept through the night silently, only interrupted by the occasional roars of wild animals lingering in the nearby forest. It was a particularly gloomy night, and as Amelia walked through the deserted area, she saw a white, glowing figure on the straw field from the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>She squinted, and the sight made her eyes grow wide as she cried, “Light..!”</p>
<p>The white elf was drenched to the bone. His face appeared paler than already was against the darkness. His body shone like a jade, with no dust settling on his skin.</p>
<p>The bloodstains smeared on his ragged clothes and a big wound on his feet were the only indications that he was injured.</p>
<p>He was buried in the pit, which appeared to be huge enough to cover all of him.</p>
<p>Alfonso hummed beside her. His scarlet eyes were brimming with pure malice. “I guess it wasn’t deep enough. I’ll do better next time.”</p>
<p>She realized that Alfonso wasn’t lying when he said that he’d bury him alive. He did, and admittedly unashamed at that, too.</p>
<p>Amelia scoffed at the dark elf’s pettiness. The white elf saw them and immediately stood up and threw her a smile, paying no attention to the dark elf beside her.</p>
<p>He was chuckling sheepishly after being found at an embarrassing position, subtly trying to hide the big hole behind him but failing miserably. As if his thin, frail body could hide it from view.</p>
<p>What a pitiful sight.</p>
<p>Amelia felt sorry for the white elf and she was about to console him when Alfonso’s palm snaked to her nape, holding the back of her skull. He forced her head to the side and said, “There’s nothing to see here.” He sneered.</p>
<p>Amelia shook her head adamantly. After contemplating what to do with the white elf, she turned and addressed Alfonso. “Why don’t you just take him with you? You’re not going to leave him here, are you?</p>
<p>As she was speaking to him, she was discreetly beckoning the white elf to head to the magic carpet behind her. The white elf quickly abided and climbed atop of it, sitting upright with his drenched clothes. His wound was already healing, and in a minute, he would look healthy as he had once been; elves weren’t called immortal for no reason.</p>
<p>Alfonso smirked. He didn’t object at the slightest. At this point, Amelia knew him well enough that he only acquiesced mainly because he had something up on his sleeve— like a cat that doesn’t move for a while before causing a much bigger trouble than initially planned.</p>
<p>He was exactly the same.</p>
<p>Amelia was nervous as the three sat on the carpet unspeaking with each other. The magic carpet wafted them up in the air and headed towards their destination.</p>
<p>The wind was chilly as it brushed against their skins. The air was thick with fog, and Amelia could see an inky black mist from a distance.</p>
<p>Smoke and the reeking stench of corpses enveloped the town. The mountain pile of decaying bodies was reduced to bones and skeletons in a matter of just a few days.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? What happened to the cleaners assigned by the Church?” Amelia whispered.</p>
<p>Didn’t they already make themselves clear that leaving a huge pile of corpses in such a manner was strictly prohibited? Piles like these were the perfect ground for evil spirits to breed on. When she and Rita found a dead pile previously, Debra informed the local Church about the incident and asked them to send a few personnel to clean the place up.</p>
<p>The place should’ve been cleaned by now.</p>
<p>But Amelia knew from the sight that something had changed, since a countless number of evil spirits were floating outside the city gate.</p>
<p>“Which way should we go?” The dark elf’s eyes narrowed. He doesn’t seem to be bothered by their surroundings. A black fog made its way toward him, circling around him like a dog seeing his owner after a day of separation.</p>
<p>Amelia sympathized with him. She raised her hand and pointed a finger to the city gate.  “Just follow the road. There are a lot of evil spirits here. I’m afraid we will be having a hard time getting in.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, the evil spirits heard their voices and immediately dashed towards them with a thunderous roar.</p>
<p>They didn’t dare getting close to Alfonso, but they did try to seize Amelia and the white elf. Their black fingertips were sharp and pointed, murderously intimidating as they zeroed in on Amelia. There were too many of them to count, endless in numbers.</p>
<p>Amelia pulled her wand out and waved it in a precise manner, killing an evil spirit instantly.</p>
<p>Evil spirits were by far the weakest of all the dark creatures. They have no intelligence with them, only acting on instinct. What made them so troublesome was the fact that they could come back to life once they were killed, forming their souls over and over again until they were completely annihilated.</p>
<p>They were now faced with tens of thousands of enemies, all of which had the ability to be resurrected several times, infinite like tidal waves in an ocean.</p>
