            <p><strong>Chapter 84 – Familiar Stench</strong></p>
<p>Amelia was exhausted by the time she got back at the hotel. She was thinking of taking a much-needed bath before going straight to bed. When she opened the door, she stepped right in and bumped into the white elf, who happened to be standing by the door.</p>
<p>She blinked and looked up at the elf. “Oh. Have you had dinner already?”</p>
<p>The white elf nodded timidly.</p>
<p>Amelia scratched her head, “Care to go back to your room first? I think they gave you a separate room.”</p>
<p>Wordlessly, the white elf stood up and walked past Amelia. She was about to turn around and close the door behind her when a palm on her shoulder stopped her. The white elf leaned close to her neck as he sniffed her skin repeatedly.</p>
<p>Amelia was startled at the little distance between them. She could feel his breath fanning on her skin, and he lightly brushed her neck with his cold fingers.</p>
<p>Amelia shivered at the contact. Before she could slap his hand away, a tentacle immediately popped out and harshly smacked his white wrist.</p>
<p>The white elf pulled his hand away and supported his slumped wrist with the other, ignoring Alfonso. His expression remained still and unfazed, as if his hand wasn’t just fractured. He looked at Amelia and said in a soft voice, “You smell a little strange.”</p>
<p><em>Strange? </em>Amelia thought she must’ve reeked of sweat after spending the whole day outside. She was a little embarrassed of herself, and only then did she realize that the stench from the treatment center must’ve rubbed on her skin. She patted her neck consciously and said, “It’s someone else’s stench, not mine.”</p>
<p>The white elf nodded, his long eyelashes fluttering softly. It looked like he was relieved and walked out of the room.</p>
<p>With a click, the door closed.</p>
<p>As soon as they were alone, Amelia met Alfonso’s seething gaze, “Don’t you know how hard it was for me to explain why the room was so messy the last time?” She sighed and dragged her palms against her face and added, “If you want to beat him up go somewhere else. Okay?”</p>
<p>He looked at her with disdain, “Then I’ll go kill him now.”</p>
<p>Amelia walked to the closet and filed through her clothes, unbothered with the elf’s remark. “Okay. Fine. Whatever. Go ahead if that’s what you want. I’m going to take a shower so you stay quiet and don’t even think of peeking.”</p>
<p>She filled the tub with hot water and scattered a few rose petals. The scent reached Amelia’s nostrils and she felt the elegance of it all. She tipped her toe into the water before submerging herself completely, instantly relaxed at the warmth the water provided.</p>
<p>She sighed contentedly and splashed the water in a playful manner. As she was enjoying herself, her thoughts drifted to the commoners, who always served the nobles without fail and made sure they’re well and comfortable. But such service was expected of them, and the nobles look at the commoners as nothing but mere objects that could easily be discarded anytime.</p>
<p>Amelia sometimes reminds herself to never forget where she came from, and it’s only a matter of time when she gets used to the lifestyle she had now, and forget the sufferings she had to endure when she was still at the lowest part of the society.</p>
<p>Her concern and empathy towards others grew weaker by the day, her privilege making her inconsiderate of other people’s plight.</p>
<p>Amelia exhaled a series of deep breaths.</p>
<p>After scrubbing herself, Amelia got up and wiped her body down. She put on clean clothes and as she was smoothing her shirt from the wrinkles, her fingers brushed a bump that was on her back. She stretched her palms out and felt the round bump, prodding curiously and it hurt when she pressed too hard.</p>
<p>Her heart raced. She wiped the condensation off the mirror and gathered her hair over one shoulder. She turned her back facing the mirror and craned her neck, wanting to see what the bump was exactly.</p>
<p>The expanse of the girl’s skin was smooth. She had a pair of plump breasts, slender waist and her collarbones were visible under her thin skin. However, her flawlessness was stained by a black spot near her shoulders. It seemed to be mimicking her breathing, like a leech that was attached to her body as it greedily sucked the life out of her.</p>
<p>Amelia gasped, eyes widening in fear.</p>
<p>A flash of lightning struck from the sky, blinding her for a second and raindrops poured down heavily as it hit the pavement.</p>
<p>In the midst of the heavy storm, Amelia heard a sharp sound of screaming and wailing, the cacophony of noises trying to dominate the other in a deafening roar.</p>
<p><em>“God, are you giving up on us?!”</em></p>
