            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 71 – In the Same Bed (1)</strong></p>
<p>After finishing their meals, Amelia had the overwhelming urge to leave her purse on the table in an attempt to pay for the free meal. But her instincts prevented her from doing so since she barely had any money left to fend for herself. A little disheartened, Amelia grabbed the purse and placed it inside her pocket.</p>
<p>A full moon was on the horizon, along with lampposts positioned at certain intervals lighting up the street in a bright glow. They leisurely strolled around the area due to Amelia’s persuasion, checking every nook and cranny and only left for the Church when the crowd dwindled down and the shops closed.</p>
<p>The Church was void of people, and only a few knights were stationed at the doors. Rita yawned and bid Amelia goodbye, leaving her alone in the bedroom.</p>
<p>Well, not entirely alone, since Alfonso was inside her purse.</p>
<p>She didn’t know how to face Alfonso after the mishap earlier. She was contemplating how to break the awkwardness of it all when a tall figure suddenly appeared in front of her, snapping her out of her senses as she took a few steps back.</p>
<p>“Hey, lackey.” The elf was a head taller than her. He gazed down at her, eyes dark and hooded and the arch of his eyebrows was set so firmly that it made Amelia’s legs tremble.</p>
<p><em>Evil to the extreme. He really is the God of evil.</em></p>
<p>Amelia glanced at him, her body shaking from obvious fear and paranoia. She propped her back against the wall and kept her knees from buckling underneath her. She tore her gaze away from his intimidating face, not daring to catch his eyes with her own.</p>
<p><em>Shit. Is he going to kill me? </em>Icy dread crept her insides. <em>Oh God, am I going to die?</em></p>
<p>She shivered as panic settled in. She looked at the ground, trying to even her breathing and looking at him was out of the question. She wouldn’t dare, not when she knew what he was exactly.</p>
<p>Alfonso’s eyebrows furrowed, causing creases to line up his forehead. “What’s wrong with you? Look at me.” The woman was a cowering mess, so unlike the person who used to hit him whenever she pleased.</p>
<p>He never had it in him to be patient. He stretched his hand out, fingers grazing her neck as he forced her head to look at him. Amelia’s breath hitched, alarmed at the sudden contact and she felt how long and slender his fingers were as it held her face. His grip was a little forceful, sure, but it did not inflict any pain.</p>
<p>His domineering presence demanded attention, and Amelia had no choice but to heed.</p>
<p>Amelia’s body stiffened upon realizing how close they were to each other. He bowed his head slightly, making his white hair fall to the sides and his devilishly handsome face was the only thing that Amelia could see.</p>
<p>The steady, rhythmic sigh of their breaths fanned across each other’s cheeks. His gaze was set upon hers, rendering Amelia completely breathless. She stayed where she was rooted, her back still flushed against the wall.</p>
<p>“You…” The elf started, lips parting before closing them again. With the little distance between them, Amelia peeked at the red tongue resting in his mouth.</p>
<p>Her heart was thrashing in horror. It felt like she was just waiting for her death sentence.</p>
<p>“You…” The elf stared at her, eyebrows raising as he asked, “Are you still angry?” A hint of confusion was evident in his tone.</p>
<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p>Amelia was stunned into silence. She didn’t expect that at all. “W-what? Angry for what?” She stammered.</p>
<p>“Why were you avoiding me then?” Irritation flashed in his red eyes, tightening the grip she had on Amelia. His honey-toned skin stood out greatly from Amelia’s pale, white skin.</p>
<p>Ever since the day started, the elf noticed that Amelia had been acting strange. She left him at the balcony that morning, running as fast as her legs could and she even stayed inside the closet until her friend forced her to come out.</p>
<p>“I-I…” Amelia said weakly. She couldn’t bring herself to ask the question that was troubling her the whole day: <em>“Dear, care to tell me that you’re not just an ordinary dark elf, but the Dark God himself?”</em></p>
<p>Of course not! Asking him that upfront would lead to her death. She was not that stupid.</p>
<p>Alfonso had yet to recover his memories, giving Amelia more time to go on as if she had no clue on what he was, and if he did suddenly remember—</p>
<p>Well, she’d be dead then, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>Amelia gulped and trained her eyes on the elf’s Adam’s apple instead. “Yes. I’m still angry, that’s why I’m avoiding you.” She replied dryly.</p>
<p>“How spiteful.” The elf sneered, clicking his tongue.</p>
<p>He seemed to be relieved, though. He dropped his hand that was clutching on her face, straightening his back as he told her reassuringly, “I see. I’ll let you know when I head out next time.”</p>
<p>His obedience caught Amelia off guard. She nodded her head shakily. “Okay.”</p>
<p>Alfonso mimicked her actions, also nodding in acknowledgment before turning his back. He took in the size of the room and went straight to the bed that looked so soft, prompting him to pull the quilt to the side and laid down.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>The events that transpired today rendered Amelia tired to the bone, reacting a few seconds too late as the realization dawned on her: There was no basement here, and they had no choice but to share the bed together!</p>
<p><em>Would I be able to sleep tonight? </em>Amelia thought to herself.</p>
