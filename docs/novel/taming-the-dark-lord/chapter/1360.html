            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 64 – Undeniable Attraction (1)</strong></p>
<p>How do you discipline a dark elf who intentionally doesn’t listen to you?</p>
<p>First things first was to open the bag, show him a smile so he wouldn’t suspect anything, please him, say anything that would coax him out with his tiny wings and when he least expected it, hand him the sour fruit that looked deceivingly sweet.</p>
<p>Then, you would have a belching elf right in front of you.</p>
<p>“How dare you hide this from me?” Amelia had her hands akimbo, staring at the elf who was fluttering jerkily in the air before falling to the ground.</p>
<p>With a ‘bang’, the elf transformed back to his original size as he stood up abruptly, glaring daggers at Amelia as he screwed in disgust and spat on the floor. “What are you doing?!” He shouted in irritation, mouth reeking of acrid taste.</p>
<p>“Weren’t you listening to my conversation?” Amelia raised one brow, accusation evident in her voice. “The ‘demon’ she was talking about… Dark skin, white hair and a face with a gold knife-shaped tattoos… That’s you, right?”</p>
<p>It really was him.</p>
<p>Alfonso looked at Amelia, holding her gaze with a glum expression, “So what if it was me?” He snorted in her direction, mouth twitching mockingly as he added. “Are you going to stand up for her?”</p>
<p>It was a tough question; and one wrong answer would surely provoke the elf and make him lash out. Amelia didn’t have to think for too long, however. She quickly dismissed the idea and said unhesitatingly, “Of course not.”</p>
<p>Alfonso studied her closely to see if she’s lying to him or not. “Why wouldn’t you?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Because you are far more important to me than her.” Amelia stated as a matter of factly, voice firm and resolute, “I help my relatives however way I can. It doesn’t matter whether they did something wrong or not.”</p>
<p><em>Relative?</em></p>
<p>Alfonso was taken aback for a second, completely caught off guard that Amelia referred to him as such. He didn’t expect that she would be this direct, this candid when he asked her that question. Who would’ve thought that this temperamental woman would be so honest?</p>
<p>He gazed at her so fixedly that Amelia couldn’t help but stare back.</p>
<p>His eyes bore all of that was cruel and outrageous, and it looked absolutely threatening enough to fend off enemies at one glance. There was no hint of kindness behind those red orbs, menacing and despicable in its own. But despite that, Amelia had always been drawn to it, always found it so beautiful and she was reminded of brilliant rubies shimmering in the dark.</p>
<p>And if she were to have a gemstone of that sort, she would embed it into a crown and perch it above her head, and she’d make sure to take care of it every single day.</p>
<p>It was only wishful thinking, though. The money she had was barely enough, and even if she could afford such a luxury, it would be nothing but a waste since she didn’t have it in her to value such precious stone, and she doesn’t want that.</p>
<p>Amelia was snapped back to her senses as she was reminded of her current situation. She swiftly looked to the side, avoiding the elf’s gaze and he did the same. There was a faint shift in the air, the bubble they unconsciously got sucked in to burst like a deflated balloon, shaking them as they were anchored back to reality.</p>
<p>They stood face to face, yet their eyes were looking someplace else. Both of them felt something was strange, but they couldn’t put their finger on what it was. And when their eyes met for a fraction of a second, they felt their surroundings grow hot, like the air around them was void of air.</p>
<p><em>What’s going on? </em>Amelia racked her mind to make sense of whatever it was that lingered around them, but came up with nothing. She decided to shrug the thought off as she opened her bag and waved at the elf with one hand. “Get back inside. We’ve been away for too long. They must be on their way looking for me.”</p>
<p>The way she beckoned for him looked as if she was prodding a dog to come closer, and Alfonso’s forehead creased in annoyance. The faint sound of soft footsteps were making its way toward them, and Alfonso had no choice but to transform back into his miniature state and hastily hide inside Amelia’s bag.</p>
<p>The bag felt heavier as she slung it back to her waist. She turned around and she was just in time to see Debra walking towards her, wand grasped tight on one hand.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? You were gone for quite a while.” Debra asked, and her expression was as rigid as a rock. The fingers wrapped around the wand tightened its hold, and it was clear that the necromancer’s presence earlier increased her anxiety tenfold. Debra felt like someone was lurking in the shadows and that they would suddenly come out to attack her.</p>
<p>“I relieved myself.” Amelia said sheepishly, touching her flat belly and smiled at Debra. “I want rice… I’m famished.”</p>
