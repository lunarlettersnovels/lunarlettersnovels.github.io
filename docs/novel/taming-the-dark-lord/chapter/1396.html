            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 28 – Causing Trouble (1)</strong></p>
<p>“I don’t know what happened. I only remember that I suddenly fainted. I don’t remember anything else.” Debra said, her eyes piercing.</p>
<p>“Me too.” The saints nodded in agreement, gazing at the fire. They weren’t bothered at all with the flames that surrounded them. What they were worried about was the heretic that was behind this whole mess, who was powerful enough to stun the saints all at once, and no one even saw who it was.</p>
<p>They have never encountered something as powerful and mysterious as this one, even with the years of experience they have under their belts. The fire was contrarily simple, but the execution itself was daunting to think about.</p>
<p>Amelia made a show of having just woken up like the rest of them. She pushed herself from the ground, and stood up roughly as if it was an excruciating effort on her part.</p>
<p>Rita helped Amelia up and steadied her. “Why don’t we go out first? The person who did this must be very powerful. What if it’s still here? I think it would be best if we go out, and let the bishop know what happened.”</p>
<p>The saints agreed with what Rita said. Debra, however, exclaimed her opposition. “No way!”</p>
<p>Debra glared at her fiercely. “Think about it. The person who let the two witches escape must have been a heretic as well. They were all cunning and cruel, and I think there’s more to this than just knocking us unconscious. Something else is going on here. I’m sure of it.”</p>
<p>Debra paced back and forth a few times, eyebrows raised as she voiced her thoughts out loud. “Maybe these flames served were used as a distraction, a diversion tactic to hide something bigger. We can’t let our guards down. Or maybe all of this is just an illusion.” Debra guessed, turning around to face the saints.</p>
<p>Confident she may seem of her words, she only said that to prevent the saints from listening to Rita.</p>
<p>And getting out of this fire, too.</p>
<p>The two witches escaped so easily right under the saints’ eyes, and they even set the Church aflame. It was a horrible sight, and everyone present would surely be punished by their superiors.</p>
<p>Debra’s chance of being a host to the Sacred Ceremony would certainly be at stake, and the honor might be given to any of the bishops.</p>
<p>Debra won’t allow that to happen. Not when she’s here.</p>
<p>In her eyes, she should be the one who should host the Ceremony. She had been waiting for this chance all her life. Meeting the Light God was always something she’s been dreaming of. If she was given this opportunity, her life would be complete and she would have no regrets dying.</p>
<p>Debra clenched her fists. She needed to turn this situation around, and have the saints cooperate with what she’s about to do. She only had a few minutes left before the bishop and the pope arrived.</p>
<p>She just had to wait for a bit longer, until the fire was big enough to threaten the saints’ lives. Then she would step in to rescue them from the flames, and be recognized as a hero. It would be a lot more convincing too if she got a little hurt in the process.</p>
<p>With this idea in mind, she reckoned she wouldn’t be blamed for this whole fiasco, and that it was merely an accident. Debra hoped that everything would work in her favor.</p>
<p>Unlike the chief saint who stayed on the sides and did nothing. Debra glowered at Amelia’s direction, who seemed to be distraught.</p>
<p>Debra faced the saints. “Everyone, we are currently facing a sinister force. We must remain vigilant. What happened today was completely bizarre, and I think it is much safer for us if we stay still, and wait for someone to come and rescue us. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“She’s right.”</p>
<p>“The bishops will be here soon. So I think it’s okay if we wait for a little bit longer.”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded their heads in approval.</p>
<p>“Alright. Everyone please come closer. I will place a barrier to protect everyone.” Debra said, her arms outstretched as she beckoned the saints towards her.</p>
<p>After listening to the whole thing, Amelia raised her eyebrows. She couldn’t believe how ridiculous Debra sounded, and it was even more ridiculous that the saints took Debra’s words to heart.</p>
<p>Amelia turned, and it seemed like Rita bore the same sentiment as her, but she agreed nonetheless albeit reluctantly.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, she too, initially felt that it was a smart thing to do, and she herself was almost convinced.</p>
<p>“If these flames are really unusual like Debra makes it seem to be, how come they have not attacked us yet—” Amelia whispered to herself before a piercing scream sliced through the air.</p>
<p>“Ahh!!”</p>
<p>The blazing red and yellow flames flared brightly before dimming to a pitch-black color. It swirled like it was a devil’s tentacle, almost setting a saint aflame if not for the latter’s quick reflexes. The saint was able to dodge it the second it roared uncontrollably.</p>
<p>So it was indeed not an ordinary flame!</p>
<p>Debra stared at the horror in front of them, making her step back as she came up with a new plan. “It seems like I was right. There really is something unusual with this fire. Come closer to me and do not panic. The bishops will be here soon.”</p>
<p>The crowd gasped in unison, following Debra’s order as they quickly huddled together. They clutched on each other’s arms desperately, watching the flames billowing right before their eyes.</p>
<p>Although the black flames looked intense, the flames didn’t really reach them. As long as they stayed where they were, they would be fine.</p>
<p>“Debra is a lot smarter than the other one. She was able to come up with a solution with just one look. We would’ve been dead by now if we listened to the chief.” Someone from the back exclaimed.</p>
<p>Amelia rolled her eyes. <em>‘Bastard. Who did this?’</em></p>
<p>The side of her mouth twitched as realization came crashing down. She looked around her surroundings timidly, making sure no one was looking at her before placing her hand inside her pocket.</p>
