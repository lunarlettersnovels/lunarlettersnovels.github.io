            <p><strong>Chapter 88 – I’ve Already Seen It (2)</strong></p>
<p>“I’ve already seen it.” The elf grumbled, interrupting her thoughts.</p>
<p>Amelia blinked as she was pulled back to reality. “What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“You do know you take your clothes off when you sleep, right?”</p>
<p>The elf didn’t need to explain further. The implication in his words was clear as day.</p>
<p><em>Damn it. </em>Amelia was internally dragging her palms against her face wondering when the elf saw her in an undressed state. With her mind whirring with embarrassment, her hand clutching onto the elf’s wrist slackened, prompting the elf to continue with his ministrations.</p>
<p>The cold feeling of his touch slid along the curves of her body down to her snow-white legs, stopping when it reached the black spots that accumulated there.</p>
<p>The spots began to tremble like scattering bugs as they quickly dispersed in all directions. They emitted minute sounds of squeaking, scrambling away until none of them were left on her skin.</p>
<p>The sight instantly left her at ease; her body loosened after being so tense ever since the black spots appeared on her flesh. With the spots nowhere to be found, it felt like a splinter was finally pulled out of her chest. Her complexion was also progressively getting better and her breaths were no longer labored.</p>
<p>There’s no trace of any of the black spots. She squeezed her arms as she regained her bearings, muttering. “I’m okay, I’m okay” repeatedly to herself that she didn’t notice Alfonso staring at her with a blank expression.</p>
<p>There was a hint of disgust swimming in the elf’s eyes, like he couldn’t believe he’s wasting his time on someone as unworthy as Amelia.</p>
<p>Of course, Amelia didn’t fail to notice his glaring after she turned to look at him, thinking that the dark elf had been growing more like a rabid dog as the days went by.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, she was swept off her feet as he lifted her from the ground so unexpectedly that she had to wrap her legs around his waist to keep herself from falling. Her face reddened and her heart raced wildly against her ribcage.</p>
<p>The elf’s handsome face was only a few inches away from hers. He was holding onto her tightly with no intention of letting go, and the strong grip he had on her reeked of superiority.</p>
<p>Amelia wrapped her arms around his neck reflexively. Her body was stiff as a ragdoll and she could feel the shift in their surroundings as they moved rapidly. Before they went farther away, she signaled him by pulling the skin on his neck and yelled, “The book! Don’t leave the book.”</p>
<p>He immediately brought his whip out and wrapped it around the black book. He beckoned it back and the book flew up in the air and fell right into Amelia’s arms.</p>
<p>They both stayed silent as they made their way back and thankfully, no one was around to see them. They got back inside the bedroom, noting that some of the rainwater managed to slip through the opened windows. Amelia strolled towards her bed and sat atop the covers. She opened the black book once again.</p>
<p>She was no longer troubled with the plague that enveloped her earlier, but she still needed to figure out how she could help the others out. Having Alfonso touch every single one of them was an idea she’s never going to consider, seeing that he was like a bad-tempered cat, who would never in a million years agree to such a time-consuming effort.</p>
<p>The page opened slowly, the handwritten scribbles appearing yet again.</p>
<p><em>Holy Daughter, why do you even care about those ants?</em></p>
<p><em>Even if the land is full of injustice, you yourself could survive. You are different from them— What you have with you is God’s favor, unlike the rest of the population.</em></p>
<p><em>Life will be born, and many will die.</em></p>
<p><em>This is the reality you have to accept. This is the realm of God.</em></p>
<p><em>God loves you, do you want to cross the line?</em></p>
<p>“God? Which God? The God of Light?” Alfonso said suddenly, startling Amelia as she slapped the book shut. “No! No. W-what God? Don’t listen to this.”</p>
<p>Alfonso squinted at the way Amelia was behaving. She turned her back to him, guilt eating her from the inside out for not letting him know what’s inside. She scooted the book towards her face as she whispered, “Come on now, there must be a way to end this plague. Tell me right this second.” She hissed.</p>
<p>A second’s worth of delay meant another life lost. It’s a burden that Amelia had on her shoulders causing her to be in a state of anxiety. Even with how she desperately pleaded, the black book only confused her even more.</p>
<p><em>Haha. With that skill, you might as well think more about how to make the great gods love you more.</em></p>
<p><em>‘What did it say?’ </em>She thought she was seeing things. She rubbed her eyes and saw that the handwritings were all gone, replaced with a complete prescription of medicines. There’s a small inscription at the bottom of the page where it said: Medicine for the plague.</p>
<p>Amelia attentively read the page. She would have no trouble in getting the herbs for the formula, only one, important thing that’s missing—</p>
<p>The flesh and blood of the man who cursed her.</p>
<p>After everything that happened, was she really going to scrape the Necromancer’s blood off the cracks in the floor tiles?<br>
