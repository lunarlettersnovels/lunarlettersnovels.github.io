            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 42 – Out of Control (2)</strong></p>
<p>Amelia was a bit late. When she arrived at the premises, the witch was already at war with the cavaliers.</p>
<p>She found it all bizarre. The witch standing before them no longer bore the fierceness she had earlier. Her hair was a complete mess like a bird’s nest, and her expression looked dazed as if she had no idea what she’s doing. Her attacks were in a frenzy; unorganized and downright clumsy.</p>
<p>“Did anyone get injured?” Amelia asked Debra, who was standing behind a knight.</p>
<p>“No.” Debra shook her head in response, focused on the scene before them.</p>
<p>More than a dozen knights formed a circle, trapping the witch at the center as they cornered her in huge numbers. They were threatening her with their rifles, and behind them a row of archers held bows and arrows, nocking and releasing them whenever they found an open target.</p>
<p>The witch was initially unafraid of arrows, but with the predicament she was in, she wasn’t able to dodge the arrows shot at her as she aimlessly launched her attacks. She was left unguarded, leaving her open to the knights’ ambush as arrows grazed her skin.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>She screamed suddenly, paying the barricade no heed as she shook her arms wildly, flames igniting from the bottom of her robe. The flames then rushed towards the knights as if blown by wind.</p>
<p>At the same time, Amelia abruptly positioned a wall of light, preventing the knights from being scorched alive.</p>
<p>The flames hit the wall of light with a deafening sound, booming loudly around them as charred smoke surged into the air, encompassing the entire area into a black heap.</p>
<p>Everyone doubled over, coughing loudly as smoke filtered through their noses. The formation fell apart, and even the knights who were experienced in combat ordered everyone to fall back, sensing an unusual shift in the air. “Retreat! Everyone! Quick!”</p>
<p>A more violent flame roared above them, catching some of the young knights aflame as they let out a blood-curdling scream.</p>
<p>The armor they wore didn’t help one bit, the plates growing hotter, searing as it scalded their skins, burning to the touch and the knights couldn’t get them off. The blistering heat was too vile, rendering them unable to get up and run away.</p>
<p>The witch struck again.</p>
<p>About to face his impending death, a young knight knelt to the ground defeatedly. His eyes grew wide as he hopelessly muttered a silent prayer, the flames snaking towards his direction.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, the sky above them lit up. The dark clouds dispersed as if brushed off by a pair of white hands and sunlight streamed directly to the ground.</p>
<p>The unexpected appearance of bright sunlight renewed the hope deep into the knight’s bodies. The sight was like a spring rain, soothing the burning scars etched on their skins.</p>
<p>His eyes caught sight of the moving saint. She was so beautiful he could blush just by looking at her. The saint held a magic wand on one hand, and clear determination and seriousness was set on her features. She leapt high on the air, completely in her element.</p>
<p>Her golden hair was gently billowing in the wind, and the sun behind her made her look more enchanting than she already was. She looked absolutely holy and untouchable.</p>
<p><em>Is this really the Chief Saint?</em></p>
<p>The young knight, who managed to escape the flames was pulled up by his fellow comrade. He lifted his head, panting as he stared at the saint with eyes full of admiration. He couldn’t look away from the beautiful sight.</p>
<p>And at that moment, a terrifying yet striking thought crossed his mind.</p>
<p>The saint looked like a God.</p>
<p>Like a god walking amongst men.</p>
<p>The knights haphazardly withdrew from the fires, realizing that this wasn’t something they could handle on their own. Amelia landed in front of the witch and extinguished the blaze with the flick of her hands. “Where is the person you abducted? Where did you take her?” Amelia asked sternly.</p>
<p>The witch did not answer her. Instead, the murderous air that came with her soared tenfold upon Amelia’s arrival. Her eyes darkened wickedly, and fire arrows shot from the sky, crackling and hissing in front of the witch.</p>
<p>Amelia dodged all the arrows that came her direction with brusque agility. The shafts came randomly, not having any specific target as it dropped from the sky like rain. Observing the witch’s movements, Amelia thought how unusual the witch was acting, so unlike the person she first met.</p>
<p>The witch she came face to face with earlier was sharp and unperturbed and was sure of herself. But what she’s dealing with now was someone who seemed to have gotten crazy; she was facing the onslaught of fire arrows like she completely lost it, as if she was asking for death.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p><em>What made her this insane? So out of control?</em></p>
