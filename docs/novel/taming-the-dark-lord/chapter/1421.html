            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 3 – The Adorable Little Creature</strong></p>
<p>“How is it going? Are you ready? You must knock her out with one blow, and don’t give her any chance to stand up, okay?” Debra’s eyes shone with malice as she gave instruction one of her companions.</p>
<p>Her companion nodded in agreement. “Don’t worry, the evidence is ready, and there won’t be any mistake, I assure you.”</p>
<p>Debra smirked. The two began walking side by side as they strolled around the busy street.</p>
<p>Still blending seamlessly with the masses, Amelia followed Debra silently, making sure to stay a few meters away from them as to not get caught.</p>
<p>Fortunately for her, she was granted with magic that made her hearing abilities extremely sharp, being able to perceive everything even though it was out of earshot.</p>
<p>She was able to make out everyone’s loud chatters, down to the soft drop of leaf falling right on the ground.</p>
<p>“I will have her scandal spread throughout the entire Church tomorrow. Everyone will know then what her true colors are, and whether or not she has the right to sit among the Saints.”</p>
<p>“In that case, the chief position would be mine then.” Debra chuckled menacingly. Amelia became more anxious as she eavesdropped into their conversation. Amelia grew frustrated, hating the fact that they are not saying anything specific. She didn’t have much time, and she needed to know now.</p>
<p>Restless, Amelia bit her nails as she waited for the right time to make use of her magic. Unluckily for her, the space is packed with people, and all she could do was to stare at the back of Debra’s head, and follow her close.</p>
<p>Still wandering about, Debra lowered her voice, making sure she wouldn’t be heard by anyone. “It’s incredible, really. I never thought that she would be so bold, so—“</p>
<p>“Ah! Help!” A piercing cry screamed hoarsely, cutting Debra midsentence. The cry for help came from a small house a few blocks away.</p>
<p>The crowd that was full of energy suddenly quieted down. They huddled together like mice, confused as to what’s happening.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>Debra squeezed her wand tightly, her knuckles almost white from her clutch as she shouted towards the crowd. “Don’t get close. Go find a place to hide.” She ordered.</p>
<p>The people did what they were told, fully abiding by the Saint’s utterance. Even though Debra sounded strong and composed, she herself was feeling frightened by the shrill cry that pierced the vicinity to a complete silence. Amelia followed the people’s direction and hid at the sides, still keeping watch of Debra’s form.</p>
<p>Amelia was so angry that she glared the direction where the scream came from. She wanted to pull her hair out, irritated at the fact that she was this close to hear Debra’s words.</p>
<p>It was an ordinary residential building that had a gray color. A strong, reeking scent of blood could be identified, wafting out from the slightly opened door.</p>
<p>A sharp, pungent smell of dark magic could also be detected alongside the scent of blood. The two scents mingled together produced a stinging smell that it is almost suffocating. It seemed like someone had casted dark magic inside the establishment.</p>
<p>Debra adjusted her grip on her wand, read to pounce as she carefully opened the door.</p>
<p>Opening the door wider, the scene before her shocked her completely. A pile of bodies was stacked on top of the other, and blood oozed out of the broken limbs, forming a small pool of red at the staircase down to the floor. The smell of blood was so intense that Debra had to cover her nose with her sleeve.</p>
<p>Beside the red pool kneeled a woman. Debra guessed that she was the one who let out the blood-curling scream.</p>
<p>The place looked like a human slaughterhouse, where at least a hundred of people died a gruesome death.</p>
<p>Debra was taken aback by the bloodbath. With her shaking hands, she willed herself to calm down and softly asked the kneeling woman to get out of the house. Debra then inspected the mountain of bodies, going around the stack with her eyes scrunched in horror.</p>
<p>Amelia was shocked at the sight as well. Her shoulders hunched down, a sigh coming out of her lips. After such a tragic event, the inspection team would most likely be arriving soon. She had to leave. She could not stay any longer.</p>
<p>If the inspection team somehow find her dressed so casually and so unlike the Saints’ garments, she would definitely be up for question, and she didn’t need that trouble right now.</p>
<p>Amelia stepped back, and hastily left the crowd in silence. As she veered herself away from the people, she ran faster and faster towards the alley of the street. She sighed in defeat, wondering how she got so unlucky. There hadn’t been any massacres in the royal city for many years, and yet she still found her situation coincide with one. How unfortunate.</p>
<p>Little did she know that the misfortune that happened to her was just merely the beginning, and it will come one after the other.</p>
<p>Just when you think that things couldn’t get any worse, the universe somehow shows you that it could still get even much worse than it already is…</p>
<p>For instance, the unknown creature that was right in front of her.</p>
<p>Honey-toned skin, tattered clothes and tons of wounds scratched all over his body, with blood leaking out from the cuts, and a puddle of blood pooling from where he lay.</p>
<p>His face turned sideways, his expression reeked of arrogance as he closed his eyes heavily.</p>
<p>Great. Amelia thought. She was exasperated to the core, and seeing a wounded dark elf cub right in the middle of the royal city was just infuriating beyond words.</p>
<p>A sound of neat footsteps could be heard coming towards her direction, and the sound of armor and weapon clanging around came closer and closer. The inspection team was on their way here.</p>
<p>Amelia had an unknown, dark creature in front of her, and an inspection team right on her tails. She could not help but curse. Darn it!</p>
