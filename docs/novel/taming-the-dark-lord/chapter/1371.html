            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 53 – My Dear Daughter (2)</strong></p>
<p>Debra had no chance to react but to be swept away by Amelia’s pull, and she saw the witch’s murderous gaze intently staring at her on the corner of her vision.</p>
<p>But even with the witch’s nefarious eyes lingering on her, the witch did not move one bit, letting her pass her by as the Church doors shut closed with a loud bang.</p>
<p>As soon as they set foot onto the Church, Amelia immediately dropped her hand that was clutching on her numb shoulder, instantly soiling her white dress a scarlet mess, down to the marble flooring of the Church. Amelia heaved loudly, the pain dulling her senses as Debra took her by the waist, pulling her towards the God’s statue to inspect her wound.</p>
<p><strong>Bang!</strong> There was a loud, explosion-like noise outside, and the whole Church shook from the intensity of the quake. Dust fell from the ceiling, making Debra look up. “W-what’s happening? Are they fighting?”</p>
<p>“It seems like it.” Amelia said as she peered through the window beside her.</p>
<p>It did seem like a huge fight.</p>
<p>“Why is she helping us?” Debra asked, couldn’t help the curiosity that was eating her up. “But I beat her up so much. She didn’t even take the opportunity to escape, but stayed behind to help us instead. Why?”</p>
<p>Amelia stayed silent, and placed a bandage on her shoulder.</p>
<p><em>To repay the favor, maybe?</em></p>
<p>Maybe the witch was moved for the way Amelia had let the two innocent girls escape, thus willing to save her life in return.</p>
<p>Amelia was grateful for the witch’s unexpected kindness, but the necromancer was too powerful for her to handle. The skinny witch couldn’t even win against Amelia, what more against a man who was several times stronger than her?</p>
<p>The witch would surely meet her own death.</p>
<p>There was a loud, distinct sound of crashing water outside, and after a short while, a beat of silence replaced the thunderous noise.</p>
<p>The silence stretched on, and on.</p>
<p>Amelia pursed her dry and pale lips together, and consoled Debra who was clutching on her tightly. “Don’t worry. He wouldn’t be able to get in. This is the residence of the Gods, the necromancer can’t get in…” She said in a small voice.</p>
<p>She’s not sure if she’s trying to convince Debra or herself, the words seemed unconvincing even in her own ears.</p>
<p>“Tap.”</p>
<p>A trickle of water suddenly dropped on top of her head, startling Amelia. The water mixed with Amelia’s blood on the ground, fusing together like oil and water.</p>
<p>Amelia lifted her head, and she could sense a looming presence standing behind them. She turned her head sharply, and saw the necromancer looking at them with a menacing smile plastered on his face.</p>
<p>Amelia roughly tugged Debra by the arm and sprang out of the Church as fast as she could. “Let’s go!”</p>
<p>“Go where?” Debra asked, having no clue why she’s being pulled so brutally by the latter. She matched Amelia’s pace, following her footsteps before the invisible barrier the necromancer placed expanded and swept across them, paralyzing them like an electric current. The two fell to the ground, making the necromancer laugh in sheer joy.</p>
<p>He sat on the statue of the God of Light, and one of his legs stepped on the eyes of the statue, soiling the pure white jade face with his grimy sole.</p>
<p>This was blasphemy. He was intentionally insulting God!</p>
<p>Why is the God of Light not reacting yet? The necromancer was stepping on his head as if it meant nothing!</p>
<p>Please descend from the Heavens and kill him! Put him in his place!</p>
<p>Amelia was lying on the ground. She forced her head up, the despair in her eyes growing wider by the second.</p>
<p>Debra’s eyes turned red all at once, like a light switch flickered on. She growled fiercely, her slender fingers marking, scratching the ground from the anger that was seeping out of her body.</p>
<p>The God that Debra piously devoted her time with was besmirched into a mess in front of her, ruined into shambles she couldn’t bear seeing. It was an abomination, an utter disrespect for something she had been admiring ever since she was born, and it was a maddening sight.</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid!” Amelia warned, forcing Debra back down. She gritted her teeth and looked straight at the empty eyes of the necromancer. “What are you going to do? Kill us if that’s what you want!” Amelia screeched.</p>
<p>“Kill you?” The necromancer repeated, tilting his head to the side. “How would I be able to lure the little mouse out if I kill you?”</p>
<p><em>What little mouse was he talking about?</em></p>
<p>The necromancer saw the confusion pass by Amelia’s eyes, smiling at her puzzlement. He turned his gaze to the girl beside her who was staring at him with eyes full of resentment.</p>
<p>He shook his head, and the two green flames on his eye sockets danced as if it was cheering happily. “Good job..” He raised his hand, pointing his skeletal bones towards Debra, “My dear daughter.”</p>
<p>The wind carried the scent of Amelia’s blood across the city walls, flowing over the dense forest and it reached the elf’s nostrils after a long journey.</p>
<p>Alfonso stood up, his scarlet eyes opened and he looked at the far-away distance where the scent had come from.</p>
