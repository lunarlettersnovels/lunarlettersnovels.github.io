            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 70 – Evading Him (2)</strong></p>
<p>Rita knocked on the door before pushing the door open. The lights were turned off, and the only source of light was from the moon looming outside. The thin, white curtains swished softly from the cold breeze.</p>
<p>“Where is she?” With Amelia nowhere in sight, Rita decided to leave and she was about to shut the door close when a familiar-looking fabric at the closet caught her eye.</p>
<p>She squinted, realizing that it was a skirt— which happened to be worn by someone that very day.</p>
<p>Rita craned her neck to take a better look and saw the skirt move slightly, as if it was being tugged from the inside.</p>
<p><em>“What was that?” </em>Curious, Rita made her way towards the closet and pulled the doors open, grabbing a defeated-looking Amelia that was sitting on the closet floor.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here? Playing hide and seek?” Rita teased.</p>
<p>Amelia lifted her head from her arms. She looked like she was a spoiled cabbage just waiting to be thrown out. She whimpered like a stray kitten, prompting Rita to smooth her blonde hair and asked in a soft voice. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Amelia shook her head and patted her face softly. Her plump, white cheeks glowed in the darkness. “I’m hungry. I want to eat.” She reasoned out flatly.</p>
<p>Rita realized that Amelia was not in a particularly chatty mood. She went along with Amelia’s words and acquiesced. “Do you want to eat out? I heard there are a lot of shops here offering local delicacies, one that wouldn’t be found anywhere else. Do you want to try it?”</p>
<p>Amelia let out a sigh, rubbing her stomach and nodded. “Okay. Just give me a minute.”</p>
<p>She took a cloak from the closet and draped it over her arms. She grabbed the purse from the table and tied it around her waist. When she was done, Rita linked their arms together as they headed out.</p>
<p>The shops were located on the city border. A strong, sharp smell of chili and unique spices wafted through the air, making their mouths water. Viands unlike anything else were laid out in front of them in heaps.</p>
<p>Amelia was moved to tears from the chili that stung her tongue. It’s been quite a while since she last tasted the peppers.</p>
<p>When the crowd saw the elegantly dressed women, they instantly parted like the red sea and gave them space, keeping their distance. The owner of the dining hall wiped his hands on his apron, quickly approaching them with a smile plastered on his face. “Young Masters, is there anything you’d like to eat?</p>
<p>Rita didn’t pay him any attention and faced Amelia. “Although this is not as delicious as the ones in the Church, it’s not at all bad. Do try it out and just throw it away if you don’t like it.” She said.</p>
<p>Amelia nodded excitedly. “Okay, let’s try.” She opened her purse to bring some coins out when the owner immediately stopped her, “You don’t have to pay. I mean it.”</p>
<p>The owner was a hunchbacked, middle-aged man wearing shabby black clothes. His body was shaking when he neared the Saints.</p>
<p>Common folk like him couldn’t afford upsetting nobles like Amelia and Rita. And if they had the choice, they would actually avoid them at all costs. But when they happened to face the nobles upfront, they had to humble themselves and please them to the best of their abilities, and making them angry was not an option.</p>
<p>Amelia glanced at a little boy hiding behind the shop owner. His dark eyes were pure and innocent, but they were already stained with fear. He was looking straight at her with curious eyes, making Amelia’s heart grow soft. She untied her purse and pushed her hand inside, searching for a gold coin when a cold, moving object grazed her palm, making Amelia stop in her tracks.</p>
<p><em>When did this piece of shit come in?! He should’ve informed her at least!</em></p>
<p>Amelia’s hand was frozen in place. She was afraid that her hand would get chopped off if she moved it once more. Rita on the other hand, already found a spot to seat on and beckoned Amelia to come sit next to her.</p>
<p>With her hand still inside the bag, Amelia took small, light steps, her body stiff and rigid.</p>
<p>She was no longer in the mood to eat. The miniature Alfonso was now lying atop her palm, making himself comfortable as he laid in a pleasant position. His smooth hair grazed her palms, making her skin itch.</p>
<p>Amelia shuddered.</p>
<p>She suddenly recalled having treated him badly a few days ago. She pulled his hair, twisted his ears and she even hit his head. The cruelness of her actions made her remember the line she read from the book:</p>
<p><em>If you go against his will, he will take your soul and crush it, and he will also turn your body into dust under his Holy Seat.</em></p>
<p>Her legs gave out under her, and thankfully she was seated on a stool because if she weren’t, she might be kneeling on her spot and that would make her look crazy.</p>
<p>“Dig in. How’s the food? Do you like it?” Rita asked attentively.</p>
<p>The shop owner and his son were standing at the side, waiting anxiously for Amelia’s response. The longer she stays silent, the more nervous they’d get. The shop owner was chewing on his bottom lip and squeezed his hands together to prevent them from shaking.</p>
<p>Amelia hastily took her hand out of the bag and fastened it close before putting it on the table. She did it so fast it only took her two seconds.</p>
<p>When her hand was out in the open, a slight chill brushed her fingers— an indication that her hand was damp. She must’ve rubbed against something that is soft and moist…</p>
<p>Which could only mean one thing: she accidentally grazed the elf’s mouth.</p>
<p>A sense of fear crawled down her spine. This is it, this is the day she would meet her untimely death. She had two choices: face it upfront or run away from it, but either of the two would lead to her demise anyway.</p>
<p>She slurped the hot and spicy broth, grease staining her lips. Small slabs of mutton were laid atop the noodles sprinkled with bright red peppers, and the taste was so rich it made her nostrils water.</p>
<p>“This is so delicious!” Amelia exclaimed satisfyingly, giving a thumbs up to the shop owner. She took a few gold coins from Rita’s purse and flashed the little boy a smile.</p>
<p>Amelia chuckled as she took spoonfulls of the simmering broth, shaking the table slightly. Alfonso’s ears perked up at the sound of the woman’s soft laughter as he stirred inside the purse.</p>
<p><em>So happy, huh? </em>He unconsciously pursed his lips, which was chafed raw after being grazed so abruptly earlier.</p>
<p><em>How rude. </em>But even with these thoughts in mind, the Alfonso found his stony face softening.</p>
<p>*</p>
