            <p><strong>Chapter 79 – His Treasure (1)</strong></p>
<p>Amelia stepped on the attached stool and slipped inside. Debra and Rita were already seated on opposite ends, and Rita said, “Come on. We’ve been waiting for you.”</p>
<p>Debra looked at her without saying anything. Everything and everyone had been getting on her nerves recently, and it was clear that she was not in the mood as she turned her head away from them and fixed her eyes on the window.</p>
<p>The carriages sauntered forward. The creaking of wheels and wisps of air from the open window were the only sounds in the compact space. It was a dull affair, and Amelia carefully leaned on the edge of the window with her elbow propped on the sill.</p>
<p>The dark elf was tucked against the woman’s chest, and the only thing that separated them was the thin layer of clothing she wore. He could directly feel her warmth surging through his cold body, along with that ungodly scent of hers that he grew accustomed to.</p>
<p>The elf made a disgruntled face. He was surrounded by her scent and the heat radiating off her was a little too overwhelming. He couldn’t help the blush that was spreading across his cheeks at their close proximity.</p>
<p>The city they were heading to was only a few kilometers away. The procession took a short break at noon, and they managed to arrive at the city gate before it got really dark.</p>
<p>This city was much barren compared to the one they had previously left, and people were basically dragging their feet and their figures were so thin that you could make out heavy, lidded eyes and sunken cheeks on both men and women. They had yet to see a fat, healthy person.</p>
<p>The group arrived at a hotel. They all went straight to their assigned rooms after a whole day’s worth of travel to get their much needed rest. Amelia entered hers and locked the door behind her before taking the white elf out of her bag.</p>
<p>“I’ll head out for a bit. Let the servers know if you need anything. I already informed them of your existence so there’s no need to worry. But don’t forget what you promised me. Do not, under any circumstances, tell anyone about Alfonso. Okay?”</p>
<p>The white elf nodded obediently, making his long eyelashes flutter. “Master.”</p>
<p><em>Oh God!</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time he referred to her as such, but she still couldn’t help but feel as if she’s being electrified. The beautiful elf looked like he was carved out of ice and snow, blatantly appearing like he would serve no one but you, and that he would allow you to do anything as you pleased.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for Alfonso’s glaring eyes that could crush her in an instant, Amelia wouldn’t have probably held herself back from petting him.</p>
<p>Before she left the white elf, she reminded him again. “Don’t go out. I’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>The white elf’s eyes darted up, meeting Amelia’s gaze and he threw her a sweet smile, one that reached his eyes and casted small dimples on both of his cheeks.</p>
<p>Amelia’s mind short circuited at the bewitching sight. He was just perfect beyond words it’s insane.</p>
<p>She stood there staring at the while elf with her hand perched on the doorknob. A few seconds had gone by and an impatient Alfonso immediately bit her fair skin, snapping Amelia out of her trance.</p>
<p>“Ouch!” She turned around and quickly went out of the hotel, moving towards a spot where no one would see her. She ran her fingertips on her wrist from where Alfonso bit her and hissed, seeing a deep mark sunk on her skin. “Are you stupid? Can’t you see that I was only pretending?” She scolded angrily.</p>
<p>“You know it the best whether you were pretending.”</p>
<p>Amelia couldn’t even look at him directly, a clear sign that she was guilty of his insinuation. Alfonso scoffed at her attempt in defending herself and rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“I heard there’s a market somewhere here. Would you like to go visit the place?” Amelia said instead, changing the subject. Alfonso was now towering tall over her petite figure. “We should go there together. You don’t have to transform back to your small form and just stay this way. It’s fine.”</p>
<p>She didn’t give him the time to respond and immediately grabbed his hand with hers. Magic instantly spread throughout his body upon contact, concealing his devilishly handsome features that are clearly not a human’s. It enveloped him like a second skin with an appearance of a middle-aged woman who was a bit chunky on the sides.</p>
<p>Then Amelia turned herself into a middle-aged man, smiling a little too proudly as she beamed. “What do you say about my new magic, huh? I learned this quite recently. It’s amazing, right?”</p>
<p>Alfonso looked dumbfounded at what Amelia did to him, and he knew that he had no choice but to go to the streets looking this way. She really was infuriating.</p>
<p>“Hahahaha!” Amelia bellowed heartily. She doubled in laughter at the sight of the elf’s chest that now had a pair of breasts. Tears formed on the corners of her eyes.</p>
