            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 23 – Smaller than Ever (2)</strong></p>
<p>Even with his venomous tongue, his voice was still as smooth as silk.</p>
<p>Amelia blocked the elf’s abrupt attack with the back of her hand. The person behind this magic spell was amazing beyond words.</p>
<p>Amelia never went to the inspection team again. And a few days later, the news regarding the massacre spread like wildfire, and it is said that they had caught the murderer in flesh.</p>
<p>Amelia didn’t bother to see it personally, but she heard that the huge scavenger eagle was as tall as a human, and it looked like one too. It has a peculiar form, and the only thing that sets it apart from humans was its pair of wings.</p>
<p>“No wonder that the inspection team weren’t able to find it as quickly. Such a rare case could be placed into a specimen display.”</p>
<p>Rita sat next to Amelia as she fanned herself with her feathered fan. Her expression was still as arrogant and reserved as ever. “I heard that you are responsible for this case, since the case is under the Pope’s crown. Fortunately for you, you could still make use of the bums of the inspection team. Doing so would require little effort from you.”</p>
<p>Listening to Amelia’s advice the last time, Rita neatly compiled the names and the evidences of the Bishop who had received bribes, and sent it to the inquisition. After that, she knelt in front of the statue of Light for three days and three nights, confessing her sins and begging for forgiveness.</p>
<p>She pleaded for mercy until she passed out on the floor. The Pope pardoned her then, and allowed her to keep her position as a Saint.</p>
<p>After the commotion Rita had faced, she seemed to be a little more restrained and withdrawn, no longer putting herself up front just like she used to. People don’t even spare her a glance anymore.</p>
<p>After listening to Rita’s statement, Amelia shook her head. “I checked on them before, and they contributed pretty well. I should thank them.”</p>
<p>Rita stared at her in bewilderment. She leaned close to Amelia, and covered her lips with the fan as she whispered. “Why?” Rita asked before continuing. “You are the Chief Saint! You have to consider the position you’re in. There’s no need to stoop down to such low ranks. They are just Knights and Vassals! It’s their duty to work for you. They wouldn’t have caught it as quickly if not for your command.”</p>
<p>Amelia didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>The dark elf, who was curled inside her pocket, turned and let out a hiss. With his now small form, Amelia took liberty and stashed him in his poket so she could watch over him wherever she goes.</p>
<p><em>‘This is the light of hypocrisy— full of hypocrites and pretenders alike.’ </em>He grumbled in his head as he listened to their conversation.</p>
<p>The dark elf closed his eyes as he shrugged his thoughts off off. He realized that it doesn’t matter what kind of woman she was since it had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>He could hear the woman’s steady heartbeat thumping in his sharp ears, ringing loudly as if it was his own.</p>
<p>His body was in close contact with Amelia’s, and only a thin cloth separated them. He could even feel her heated body temperature, and smell the fragrance she wore since they were in such close proximity.</p>
<p>“Achoo!” The elf sneezed softly, and covered his nose with two hands.</p>
<p>The sweet fragrance mingled harshly with Amelia’s own scent, producing a strong, pungent smell that was pretty unpleasant. He thought that maybe he should tell her to scrub her body thoroughly before and after going out. He scrunched his nose in irritation, and it felt like he was suffocating.</p>
<p>The girl suddenly stood up and walked hastily, making the elf bounce up and down inside her pocket.</p>
<p>She walked for several minutes, and after several ages, she finally stopped in an area where an overwhelming scent of magic wafted through the air. The elf grew angry as the scent closed in on him, surrounding him completely. He pinched his nose with his fingers, not wanting to smell it any longer.</p>
<p>“Under the Pope’s crown. I’m here to report.” Amelia said calmly as she continued. “With regards to the massacre that took place at the slave market. The patrols found the murderer.”</p>
<p>“So I heard.” An old man said as he gave Amelia a few slaps on the shoulder. “Well done. You have done a good job with your first task as Pope. You managed to solve such a complicated case in a timely manner. This is all you. At this rate, it will be much easier for you to go out and do more things in the future.” The man said in an assuring tone.</p>
<p>“How about the patrol team? What sort of reward will be given to them?” Amelia asked hesitatingly.</p>
<p>“They will be rewarded of course. In a few days, bonuses will be distributed among them.” The old man answered.</p>
<p><em>‘That’s it? Just a mere bonus?’</em></p>
<p>Amelia bit her lower lips. She knew that the massacre that happened under the eyes of the gods was substantially extreme. If someone managed to solve the murder case, it would do wonders to one’s own career, and he would surely be referred to as a hero.</p>
<p>She also knew that many people had been slain by the patrol team in search of the vicious bird. And a lot more people were swallowed whole inside the bird’s stomach, leaving no trace behind.</p>
<p>The Pope was solely crediting her for the job well done, while the dead knights would only receive bonuses as compensation. Their names would not be written in merit books, nor would their names be made known to the public.</p>
<p>The knights were deserving of the recognition, after having lost their lives in protecting the civilians. They did their sworn duties until their last breaths, and they should be acknowledged for it.</p>
<p>Amelia was not pleased with the Pope’s decision. She took a deep breath, and willed herself to calm down before speaking. “Under the Pope’s crown, I believe I have some concerns regarding this matter.”</p>
<p>“For this case, I only went out to look at it. From the searches, down to the arrests were done by the inspection team alone. I did not provide any substantive help, nor do I deserve the credit. The knights are the ones who deserve the honor, especially the ones who died on duty. All glory belongs to them, for they are the real meritorious officials.”</p>
<p>“I ask you to bestow the glory to the ones who really deserve it. Not me, who is in the highest position” The woman seemed to be kneeling down on the ground.</p>
<p>The elf in her pocket tumbled to the side as she bent down. His fast paced heartbeat matched Amelia’s own.</p>
<p>As if awakened from a thousand years worth of sleep, his heart trembled steadily, and with certainty.</p>
