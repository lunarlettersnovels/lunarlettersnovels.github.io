            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 77 – Unwelcomed</strong></p>
<p>Amelia instantly felt cold all over, like the temperature in the room dropped to several degrees in a flash.</p>
<p>She was about to speak when the back of her collar was abruptly pulled. Alfonso turned her around before taking her spot facing the white elf. “Don’t look.” He said flatly.</p>
<p>A cold palm was pressed to the back of her head, preventing her from turning around.</p>
<p>“You’re bold, aren’t you?” Alfonso seethed, staring at the white elf with eyes filled with bloody hatred. He looked at him the way he would look at cockroaches in a garbage dump.</p>
<p>A violent sound of water splashed against the walls. The tentacles swayed in front of Alfonso, dripping mucus as it tore through the white elf’s body, making blood drip from the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>The tentacles that were initially instructed to just wash and dry clothes were now a ruthless force to be reckoned with, and it was clear that they were adept at killing people as fast as a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>“You really dare try to lure my human, right in front of me?” Alfonso gritted out, expression gloomy and laden with murderous intent as he stared at the white elf’s form, which was stained with blood.</p>
<p>Even in that pitiful state, the white elf’s elegance was still as intact, like a snow lotus in a pile of years worth of dust.</p>
<p>The two elves contrasted each other, the opposite ends of the spectrum. One was white as snow, and one was dark as the night sky.</p>
<p>Alfonso was beyond infuriated knowing for the fact that Amelia liked anything that was related to the Light. She wore a white skirt every day, and for her to suddenly go pay the white elf a visit was a clear indication that she was undoubtedly attracted to him.</p>
<p>However, he knew he could not blame her for this. It was human nature to be drawn to such captivating sights after all, but he needed to do something, anything to project his anger out on.</p>
<p>The tentacles zippered through the white elf’s heart, bringing about a gaping stream of blood from his chest, along with the blood from his mouth dripped down to the dark, expensive carpet. Even though he looked worn and extensively bruised, his dashing good looks remained the same. Still expressionless as ever with no ounce of struggle etched on his face.</p>
<p>Fulfilling their mission, the tentacles were about to pull out when they all hissed in unison, shrieking as the blood from the elf’s wound burned their flesh like acid. His wound gradually healed on its own, and the pierced heart from the initial attack mended itself good as new.</p>
<p>Alfonso clicked his tongue, signaling the tentacles to once again pierce the newly healed heart and they did. The tentacles grew beaten every time they attacked, and they had no choice but to withdraw. “Fall back.” Alfonso commanded sternly.</p>
<p>The tentacles whimpered as they returned to their master’s side.</p>
<p>Alfonso gripped Amelia’s shoulders as he steered her away, distancing themselves from the white elf.</p>
<p>“This is interesting.” Alfonso said glumly, tipping his head towards the white elf. “How is he not dead yet?” His tone was full of confusion, never having seen such a creature like this one and wondered if the other elves were like him.</p>
<p>Amelia peeked over Alfonso’s shoulders and immediately winced upon seeing the white elf’s bloody garb. How did such a fine, young man turn out like this? He looked so beaten up!</p>
<p>The white elf was motionless, even when Alfonso prodded his healed heart, he remained unfazed and Alfonso’s laughter boomed around them. His chest that was stabbed earlier returned back to its original, unblemished state. His pectoral muscles stretched taut.</p>
<p>He was a seductive, naked beauty.</p>
<p>Alfonso cleared his throat, and Amelia took a deep breath as she thought of how she would appease the dark elf. “He’s not as good as you, that’s for sure. A-and he is nowhere near close to your dashing good looks.” She stammered quickly and she prayed that her words would pacify the raging Alfonso.</p>
<p>She side stepped Alfonso and paced towards the white elf’s cage and pulled the door open. “Light, are you Light?” She squatted in front of the white elf.</p>
<p>Behind her stood Alfonso, whose cold eyes were boring at the back of her skull, obviously displeased.</p>
<p>Light nodded silently. His cold white hands wrapped around the bars as he set his silver, grey eyes upon Amelia.</p>
<p>“Where should I start…” Amelia began, “This is a complete misunderstanding. I didn’t plan on buying you. How about this, tell me where you live and I’ll get someone to bring you back.”</p>
