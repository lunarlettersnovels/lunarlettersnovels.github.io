            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 49 – Eerie Silence (1)</strong></p>
<p>“What will happen to them?” Rita asked Amelia whisperingly, eyes shimmering with unshed tears.</p>
<p>“They’d be brought back to their respective parents, I guess.” <em>Then thrown back to the forest, again.</em></p>
<p>Amelia didn’t utter the second sentence out loud, but there’s no need to since all of them bore the same thought anyway. And for a short moment, only the soft sound of the sheets shifting and occasional whimpers were the noise in the room.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Debra said suddenly, breaking the silence, making everyone turn their gazes towards her direction. “Don’t forget what we’re here for. Let’s not be swayed by anything unrelated to our mission. Whether they die or not is not our concern.”</p>
<p>The red-haired witch couldn’t believe the words that spewed out of Debra’s lips. “Is this how you treat people? Is this the way of your Light religion, who always claimed to show mercy upon its people?” The witch questioned pointedly, gaze unwavering as she stared at Debra.</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Debra said, “Leave the religion’s name out of your filthy lips, you witch. You have no right to question how the religion works.” Debra turned, facing the knights as she ordered them to tie up the witch. They pulled her arms behind her back, restrained her wrists together before pushing her out of the house.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute!”</p>
<p>The suddenness of Amelia’s voice astounded everyone. They turned their heads, looking at the Saint who was standing in the shadows, whose blue eyes were hidden like the turbulent seas, utterly mesmerizing. “Is she really a witch?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Debra asked, clearly irritated. “This has been long determined, why are you asking this now? Why are you suddenly doubtful? Don’t forget which side you’re on, Amelia!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I know where I stand, and I’ve never been more sure.” Amelia said calmly, “Debra, can you stand before God, and say that you have never wronged any civilian, never made false claims, marking them as someone they’re not?” She said, eyes staring intently at Debra. “Shall we hold a ceremony, and ask God what the verdict is?”</p>
<p>Debra bit her lower lips red, having no idea how to respond.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>All eyes were on them, anticipating to see what would happen next. The two blonde girls were facing each other head on, both unfaltering and equally fierce as the other.</p>
<p>Debra straightened her back, eyes sharp as an eagle’s and a small smile appeared on her face. “Okay, I get it. Do you want to put a wager on it? What if they’re witches? What’s in it for me, Amelia?”</p>
<p>Debra diverted the question back to Amelia, blatantly ignoring Amelia’s question whether or not she wronged anyone.</p>
<p>It was clear that she was guilty, but Amelia kept that thought to herself. Instead, she spoke the words Debra always wanted to hear, the words that were like music to Debra’s ears: “I will voluntarily give up my position as Chief.”</p>
<p>The corners of Debra’s lips turned upwards, clearly pacified with Amelia’s statement. “Okay then. I’ll be waiting.” She was smiling as if the position was already handed to her.</p>
<p>Rita, who was making wild signals stopping Amelia from saying anything more, stamped her feet in sheer frustration. To say that she was pissed was an understatement.</p>
<p>The way people saw it, the two accused women who were staying with the witch are witches as well, and one of them was even caught wandering so late at night, which was the reason why she was arrested by the authorities in the first place. There was no other explanation than the fact that they are witches.</p>
<p>Everyone was already convinced of this, had the notion ingrained deep into their minds. So after the Ceremony of asking God Himself, Amelia would have no choice but to step down from her position as chief.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Amelia as if she was a crazed woman, like she was absurd enough to actually put her position on the line for something as trivial as proving the witch’s identity. Rita and the witch, however, were moved at the Saint’s selflessness, looking at Amelia with eyes full of admiration and respect.</p>
<p><em>‘She really lost it, huh? She must be really stupid. How foolish.’</em></p>
<p>Debra prodded Amelia to leave as immediately as they could, wanting to go back to the city center to prepare for the rituals. The three Saints led the majority of the knights as they exited the forest hastily.</p>
<p>Following close behind them were a handful of knights keeping watch of the captured witches and babies. They encircled them at a set distance, as if one of them would dare run away while the knights were close by.</p>
<p>While making their sound exit, Amelia pursed her lips together and stopped the smile from creeping on her face. She was giddy about the whole situation, thinking that this was actually a win-win situation for her: if the girls were indeed witches, the position would be out of her hands which was really great! And if the girls were not guilty of being one, then she just saved two lives, which was a great feat, too.</p>
<p>She would be happy either way, since both of it worked favorably for her.</p>
<p>It would be much better if she could get rid of the Chief position, though. It would save her a lot of time being troubled with a title she didn’t even dream of having.</p>
<p>All of them were trained in the martial arts, so their speed and agility were quite fast, leaving the others behind who were walking so slowly.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the city gate, they realized that something was wrong.</p>
<p>The surroundings were too quiet.</p>
