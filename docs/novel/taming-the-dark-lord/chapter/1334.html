            <p><strong>Chapter 90 – Outnumbered (2)</strong></p>
<p>A large number of ants working together could upend an elephant. One species may not be intimidating at first, but outnumbering the enemy was an easy feat anyone could muster. The evil spirits may be scared of Alfonso, but they were more than enough to kill Amelia.</p>
<p>Amelia crouched behind Alfonso and stayed still. She wouldn’t be able to defeat them even if she tried. The evil spirits had their eyes set on her, quickly dashing towards her direction, unseeing that they had to get past Alfonso first.</p>
<p>Alfonso was enraged at the pathetic creatures zooming towards him. He stretched his hand out with his fingers spread wide, where a cobweb of light whips came gushing out like a tide. It surrounded Amelia protectively and cleared the space before her.</p>
<p>His protection was only for Amelia, however. The white elf stumbled to the side.</p>
<p>“What’s going on? Why are they so strong?” Amelia watched with bated breath as Alfonso killed the ferocious evil spirits in a blink of an eye, repeatedly upping his killing spree hundreds of times as if he was used to it. Even though the ones near her had vanished, she could still feel them gathering so quickly she could barely catch her breath.</p>
<p>It was exasperating, and she realized that these were not just ordinary evil spirits.</p>
<p>She brought the black book out with her hands shaking tremendously. It took her a few tries before finding the page she needed, scanning the texts with increasing desperation.</p>
<p><em>The city where the curse was casted had long been occupied by powerful evil spirits.</em></p>
<p><em>‘How do we defeat them, whose presence seemed endless and encompassing?’</em></p>
<p><em>What a rude question you asked of the gods!</em></p>
<p><em>Pure virgin, if you are so free… Why don’t you just think about how to make the gods happy?</em></p>
<p>Amelia closed the book with a blank face. <em>‘Evil, this book is evil!’</em></p>
<p><em>*</em></p>
<p>Amelia’s breath hitched, rendered speechless of how the black book always seemed to spew its truths at the most crucial moments with no regard for one’s plight and misery. It conveyed nothing but certainty despite the chaos that now surrounded them.</p>
<p>The sound of the dark elf’s whip snapped her out of her reverie. She would think of how to deal with the book later. In a blink of an eye, Alfonso swiftly gathered his whip around them to form a shield against the enemies. Seemingly endless strings of light whips shot out from his fingertips, tying one evil spirit after the other. A circular band of wall circled them at top speed with Alfonso and Amelia right at the center.</p>
<p>The white elf was left outside of the shield, however.</p>
<p>Amelia felt sorry for him. He was all alone separated from them outside the circle, and he didn’t have his own protection. She gripped the dark elf’s sleeve with her palm and pulled. “You’re going the wrong way, head that way.”</p>
<p>The dark elf sported a blank expression as he steered towards the direction Amelia was pointing at.</p>
<p>Evil spirits ceaselessly kept lunging themselves but the wall blocked them from getting too close. The moment they made contact with the shield Alfonso had formed, a piercing hiss of pain was screeched as they scattered away screaming. The horizon above them was dotted by the endless number of dark spirits floating like clouds, lining the skies with their densely packed presence that even light wasn’t able to pass through. It was a scene of absolute horror that one would sure be paralyzed in fear.</p>
<p>Amelia gritted her teeth and rubbed her arms to keep her from shaking. She occasionally pointed the directions to Alfonso as she followed close behind him.</p>
<p>“How do you want him to die?” Alfonso asked without even turning to look at her. The wind blew across their cheeks, and Amelia glimpsed his long, pointed ear in between his tresses.</p>
<p>It took her several seconds before she realized that he was talking about the Necromancer. “Isn’t he already dead?” She asked.</p>
<p><em>Dead as the person who didn’t have a soul.</em></p>
<p>“We can always put his soul together again before we crush it for the second time.” The dark elf responded calmly. He made it sound like it was that simple. Perhaps he just wanted her to inflict her own vengeance personally, but Amelia responded with a shook of her head. “Forget it. He’s dead anyways. His soul was also destroyed in the process and I don’t see the need to torture him again.”</p>
<p>“Such misplaced kindness.” The elf snorted at the latter’s refusal. His lips were pulled into a thin line showing his disappointment.</p>
<p>The truth was, Amelia was thinking of something else entirely. There was a reason she wasn’t onboard with the idea of putting the Necromancer’s soul back together because as far as she remembered, the Necromancer was able to recognize the truth regarding Alfonso’s identity before his forsaken death. The thought of having his identity be out in the open frightened her tremendously, and she wasn’t ready for it just yet— or at all.  She was opposed to facing the wrath of gods and all she could do was to wait until it actually happened.</p>
<p>But what if he suddenly remembered it, though? What if piecing the Necromancer back to his unbroken state sparked his memories? Could it mean that both she and the Necromancer would be instantly killed right on the spot?</p>
<p>Conflicting emotions stirred within her very depths; guilt for having to keep the truth to herself and fear for her own life once the dark elf found out about it.</p>
<p>The Necromancer must stay dead at all costs. She would keep her foot down no matter what.</p>
<p>She was deep in her thoughts when the elf walked past her and situated himself in front of her. “If you don’t kill him, then I will.” There’s a finality to his voice.</p>
<p>A cold shiver ran down her spine. It seemed like Alfonso was already dead set on resurrecting him and killing him repeatedly until he himself was appeased. “Wait!” Amelia said with a loud voice.</p>
<p>“I was the victim here and here you are not giving me a chance to say anything! Who are you to get so worked up about it?!” She roared as she fruitlessly persuaded him but to no avail, only getting a nonchalant stare from Alfonso. He wasn’t even listening to her at all.</p>
<p>Several minutes passed between them but Alfonso remained unfaltering in his decision, making Amelia throw her hands up in surrender. “Fine!”</p>
<p>Once the Necromancer showed up alive, Amelia would need to dash towards him and gag his mouth to prevent him from speaking, and let the elf do the persecution he deemed fit.</p>
<p>She won’t let the Necromancer have any chance to reveal what he knows. Amelia will make sure of it.</p>
