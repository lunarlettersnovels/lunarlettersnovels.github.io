            <p><strong>Chapter 80 – His Treasure (2)</strong></p>
<p>She was still laughing when the elf looked down on his body, slowly lifting his gaze and stretched his short, stubby fingers and snapped them loudly.</p>
<p>With a bang, their disguise abruptly changed in an instant, making Amelia’s laughter die in her throat. She looked down and saw her chubby self, limbs all plump and stout in all angles.</p>
<p>But Alfonso appeared as a young, handsome man. He took the little girl’s pudgy hand and curled his lips in mocking. “Let’s go then, sister.” He made sure to put emphasis on his words, and his tone was playful as usual but Amelia could hear a hint of gentleness in his voice.</p>
<p>She was caught off guard at the sudden realization. She parted her lips to protest but shut them tight again, and she let herself be pulled towards the streets.</p>
<p><em>What the?</em></p>
<p>Heat rose up to her face. He really doesn’t know that he was way better looking than the white elf that came from God knows where.</p>
<p>The market was only held once every month and when the first stall came barreling in, people would instantly swarm the place in sheer excitement, making the place packed to the brim. With Amelia’s four or five year old appearance, which was all thanks to Alfonso, she couldn’t see anything other than bodies bumping to one another.</p>
<p>She wanted to jump up and smack the elf’s head in frustration.</p>
<p>“You asshole! Hurry and pick me up!” A small, tiny voice yelled. Alfonso threw her a glance and proceeded to pick her up after being kicked on the shin several times. He squatted and his hands wrapped around her knees as he lifted her up easily.</p>
<p>“How troublesome.” He said, clicking his tongue.</p>
<p>Amelia smacked him on the shoulder. “You brought this to yourself.”</p>
<p>The vendor standing next to them laughed. “What a cute relationship you siblings have!” He unfolded a cloth and flapped it once before placing it on the ground. He laid out several pieces of exquisite-looking jewelry pieces and all of them were as eye-catching as the other. Unfortunately, only a handful of people were interested in the gems seeing how costly it was.</p>
<p>The vendor sighed to himself. “The little lady is really lucky. She is so chubby and so cute.”</p>
<p>In the society they live in, being plump was a blessing since it’s a sign that one never had to miss any meals which is pretty fortunate, unlike commoners like him who would only be able to eat if they got lucky.</p>
<p>The vendor seemed to be looking over Amelia’s shoulder, and she glanced back to see what he was looking at and saw a dilapidated wooden house, where a frail-looking little girl stood. Her limbs looked like it would break once you touched them, and her eyes were looking at them curiously.</p>
<p><em>‘That must be his sister’</em>, Amelia presumed.</p>
<p>Amelia turned her head to look at the vendor again and her heart softened at the realization. She tugged the elf’s hair and signaled him to put her back down.</p>
<p>She flashed the vendor a sweet smile and said, “Pack all of them. I want all of these.”</p>
<p>The vendor looked up at her with wide eyes, startled at what Amelia said and quickly pulled out pouches as he began packing.</p>
<p>Amelia grabbed a gold bracelet and showed it to the elf. “Look at this. The craftsmanship of this one is pretty excellent. Maybe that’s why people don’t bother looking at these since they couldn’t afford it.” Plus nobles usually had specific jewelry places in mind and they wouldn’t trouble themselves looking for gems at such stalls like this one.</p>
<p>Alfonso hummed and said uninterestedly, “The quality is okay, but the color is not really nice.”</p>
<p>Amelia blinked and craned her eyes to look at Alfonso. “You know about this stuff?”</p>
<p>Alfonso shrugged in response. “I used to like it, I guess.” Creatures of various forms had their own preference in material things. Amelia placed the gold bracelet back to its place and asked, “Do you have money with you?”</p>
<p>Alfonso shook his head, prompting Amelia to take a small bag of coins and pushed it towards him. “Here. Take this pocket money with you and buy something you like.”</p>
<p>As she took the coins out of its pouch, a lingering question settled in the front of her mind: Was she taking the money from the Light God, and using it on its greatest enemy, the Dark God?</p>
<p>The money that she had came from the Light cult, meaning that it was bestowed by the Light God and spending it wisely was the first and foremost. Wasting the coins on the Dark God was not something she should be doing, and yet here she was.</p>
<p>She would surely receive the Light God’s wrath once He finds out.</p>
<p>Alfonso, however, only pushed her hand away and stated lazily, “I don’t need anything.”</p>
<p>Amelia insisted, “Buy some gold if you want. I have enough money for myself. You don’t have to worry.”</p>
<p>Alfonso chuckled at Amelia’s assurance. He leaned down and twirled her long golden hair with his fingers. The yellow tone of her blonde locks somehow complimented his dark skin, which was really surprising.</p>
<p>“I already have the most brilliant and purest of gold here.” Alfonso said, still staring at her tresses. “Those jewelry doesn’t even come close, leagues far away from this brilliance.”</p>
<p>Amelia stared at his scarlet eyes, and a cold shiver trailed down her spine.</p>
