            <p><strong>Chapter 92 – A Deity’s Blood (2)</strong></p>
<p>With Alfonso out of her sight, it was only then could Amelia breathe easily. He was getting more frightening as the days went by and she couldn’t help but think if he somehow recovered some of his memories.</p>
<p>Before, Amelia really egged him on by hitting him on the head and pulled his ears taut. But now she would think twice before she ever treats him so roughly again.</p>
<p>Gods and humans were different beings after all. She knew her place well, and even if Alfonso would remain oblivious about being a God, the power and strength that radiated off him was enough to make mortals shudder in fear.</p>
<p>Dread filled her instantly. Shouldn’t she be prepared for this?</p>
<p>Amelia dropped her head to her chest. Her thoughts were just too heavy to deal with and her body was sticky all over which frustrated her even more. She raised her hand to rub the corner of her eyes when a shadowy form appeared at her side, jolting her out of her stupor. She snapped her head behind her to identify who the intruder was only to see it was the white elf.</p>
<p>“W-what’s going on?” She stammered.</p>
<p>The white elf looked down at her seated form. She could see his golden eyes that were glinting amidst the darkness they were blanketed in, shining so brightly it was like the brilliance of the sun itself.</p>
<p>Hold on a second. His eyes were really golden, like yellow and honey rolled into one. Weren’t the white elf’s eyes silver in color, like that of a coin?</p>
<p>She could vaguely sense that something was strange. She was about to scramble away from him when the white elf pressed his palm against her shoulders to stop her from escaping. His hands were as heavy as stone, rendering her immobile as she was firmly held in place.</p>
<p>The tentacle sprang up and dashed right towards the white elf to swallow it whole. But the white elf was a lot quicker as he immediately grabbed hold of Alfonso’s materializing tentacle, squeezing it with one hand until it disintegrated into thin air; being one with the black mist that surrounded them.</p>
<p>“Who the hell are you?!” Her words came out garbled and shaky and her heart thrummed so wildly she could barely keep herself still.</p>
<p>The white elf smirked cunningly, golden pupils as cold as ice as he forcefully tipped her bloodstained jaw up to look at him. He scoffed, “I must admit that soft hearted children could be quite endearing at times…” He said with a slight shake of his head. “But letting your guard down would only destroy you in the end.”</p>
<p>Amelia had no idea what he was talking about, like he was speaking in a language she couldn’t understand. She was about to speak but no words came out of her parted lips, not realizing she’d been holding her breath all this time. The lack of response made the white elf inch his face closer to hers, face still stunningly beautiful despite its wickedness. “Let me spare you some advice. Do not show any shred of kindness towards fools, doing so would make you the fool.” He covered her eyes with his palm and Amelia’s vision turned pitch black. A wave of sudden fatigue washed over her and pulled her into the void.</p>
<p>Before she could completely lose her consciousness, she was able to make out his words that sounded like an echo. “Go to sleep now. Tomorrow will be a much better day.”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>At the dilapidated Church, the tentacle was zippering through the cracks that had formed on the floor tiles with attentiveness and zeal, but Alfonso stomped his foot impatiently and urged it to move faster. “Hurry up.”</p>
<p>The tentacle squealed loudly as its body expanded several times its original size. It slithered the whole perimeter of the space ceaselessly until it found a small bit of remaining flesh and blood of the Necromancer. It hissed and stopped at a particular area near the Church. Alfonso pinched his nose and smelled, the disgusting stench was indeed the Necromancer’s.</p>
<p>He threw the flesh and blood towards the tentacle without much thought. Then, he ran as fast as he could managing a hundred of meters in a span of just a few seconds while the tentacle struggled to match his pace. He sped up even more with the wind blowing across his face<u>,</u> making the distance between him and the tentacle grew even much further apart.</p>
<p>A bad feeling in his heart enveloped his senses. The premonition of gods was true and certain that he didn’t need to think twice over it. He sped faster and faster in each passing second.</p>
<p>The more steps he took, the more uneasy he felt. After a brief while, he finally came to a stop where he had left Amelia.</p>
<p>The scent of his divine blood still lingered in the air, and a trail of small footprints were stomped on the ground, but Amelia was nowhere to be seen. She’s gone.</p>
<p>He sniffed the air once more, detecting a faint, familiar scent but before he could recognize what it is, the blow of the wind swept it away.</p>
