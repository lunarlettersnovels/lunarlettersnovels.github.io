            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 14 – Transformation (1)</strong></p>
<p>In just a few seconds, the elf’s small body turned into a full-grown man, and Amelia saw the transformation with her own eyes.</p>
<p>It happened too fast that Amelia was nailed right in her spot, unmoving. The cute dark elf struggled—his eyes were squeezed tight, and when he opened his eyes, he blinked slowly before looking down at his open palms, gazing at it as if in wonder.</p>
<p>Taut muscles could be seen under his honey-toned skin, and protruding veins were stretched out from his forearms down to his fingertips. He looked slender and chiseled, his features clearly that of a man.</p>
<p>He’s not actually a child after all.</p>
<p>The dark elf adjusted his position on the bed, slowly pushing himself towards the wall behind him as he leaned back. He huffed from the effort, stretching his legs in front of him in an attempt to make himself comfortable. It was clear he was still adjusting to his much bigger form.</p>
<p>The wall he was leaning on was cold— cold enough to jolt him awake as he looked around his surroundings, his sight landing on Amelia. He could smell her quite well from where he was seated.</p>
<p>Her scent was so strong, so vivid that it was almost suffocating.</p>
<p>The elf covered his nose in revulsion, looking at Amelia with clear irritation as her scent made its way past his nostrils.</p>
<p>Her scent reeked, and it was absolutely disgusting.</p>
<p>It was tolerable earlier when he was still in his small form, but now that his built is a lot bigger, his senses seemed to have heightened extremely since he couldn’t bear to stand her scent any longer. He felt like he’s being drowned.</p>
<p>Looking at his troubled expression, Amelia leaned closer and asked him. “Are you in pain? Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“Don’t come any closer!” He screeched, backing away from Amelia as he scooted near the edge, his bloodshot eyes laden with fear. He could see Amelia clearly amidst the dimness of the room, her lovely face reflecting into his vision as their eyes met.</p>
<p>As if time had suddenly stopped, both of them stared at each other in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>Amelia was momentarily caught off guard by the his beauty, gazing deep into the elf’s orbs as she stared in wonder.</p>
<p>The knight said the trace had disappeared, was it because she took him under her wing?</p>
<p>She leafed through a book about dark creatures once, and she knew that when a magical creature is greatly injured or on the verge of death, it transforms itself back to its’ infancy period to slow down its weakened state. It was not a common occurrence, but it happens.</p>
<p>When she saw the little elf lying on the ground, Amelia didn’t think that it would actually be a full-grown elf— one that was capable enough to kill a number of human beings.</p>
<p>Amelia gulped and straightened her back. She broke her gaze from the elf and looked to the side. She had no idea what to think, her hands felt clammy as anxiety gnawed at her. “There’s something I need to do. I’m going out.”</p>
<p>She bolted out of the basement.</p>
<p>Like a mist, what happened earlier that day instantly clouded her mind. She remembered what it looked like. The bloody mess that was oozing out of the people’s bodies, which were stacked on top of the other as if they were nothing but sacks of rice. Those slain victims must have been someone’s husbands, wives, or worse, children— people who were killed viciously in an unexplainable massacre.</p>
<p>The murderer might have escaped under her protection. And he might even kill a lot more people in the future.</p>
<p>Amelia’s heart pounded violently against her ribcage. If she indeed had a hand in the murderer’s escape, she would definitely be in huge trouble.</p>
<p>She shook her head, trying to get rid of her grueling thoughts. She needed to find out what really happened before jumping into conclusions.</p>
<p>And if he were, Amelia wouldn’t let him get away with it.</p>
<p>In the basement, the dark elf was still leaning against the wall, listening to Amelia’s light footsteps above him as she paced back and forth, as if in deep contemplation.</p>
<p>A trail of dust fell to the ground in tune with Amelia’s pacing one floor above him.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and breathed deeply. The flickering candle casted shadows on his face, the yellow glow emphasizing his beauty a lot more.</p>
<p>After a long while, he lifted up slightly from the wall, and let out a deep exhale.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon, the temperature drops down satisfyingly, no longer bearing the same, scorching heat at noon. There was a gentle breeze blowing through the dense forest, the leaves swaying slightly from its branches as cool air swept in.</p>
