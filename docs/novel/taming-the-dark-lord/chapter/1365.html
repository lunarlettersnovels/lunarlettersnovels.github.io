            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter 59 – You Don’t Like Me (1)</strong></p>
<p>Amelia just got back in time to see Debra struggling to crawl out of the dirt.</p>
<p>With the necromancer gone, the skeletal hands that forced Debra to the ground turned into a foul-smelling gunk, trapping her in the middle. Debra’s eyes twitched at the grime that covered her skin, and it provoked the huge part of her that was obsessed with cleanliness.</p>
<p>She was so angry she could collapse.</p>
<p>“Amelia?” Debra’s eyes brightened at the approaching Saint, and for the first time she was genuinely happy to see her as she cried, “You’re still alive! Help me out of here!”</p>
<p>Amelia quickly did what she was told and pulled Debra by the elbows. When Debra righted herself, she used the remaining magic that she had to clean herself up and asked Amelia, “Where is the necromancer? And where did you go?”</p>
<p>Amelia placed her hand on her nape and muttered sheepishly. “Well… I killed him.”</p>
<p>Debra blinked in surprise. She was not expecting that at all. “Where’s the body?”</p>
<p>The Saint pointed to the sludge that covered the ground, and if one looked closely, one could see what remained of the necromancer’s clothes slotted in between the pile of gunk. It was undoubtedly his and Debra was really amazed.</p>
<p>She turned her head and looked at Amelia with admiration in her eyes. She was completely awestruck, and Debra wondered why she didn’t notice that Amelia bore such strength. It appeared like Amelia could do nothing all day but when she did make use of her magic, she could crush her enemies down to the ground when she wanted to.</p>
<p>It was astounding; Amelia was more than what meets the eye.</p>
<p>Amelia ran to the Church gate and immediately crouched down to drag the witch out of the pile of rubble. It seemed like she was barely breathing, a huge gaping hole enveloped her head on the side, and by the looks of it, she would surely be dead if not for Amelia’s magic.</p>
<p>“I’ll save her. Debra, go to the city gate and check on Rita and the others.” Amelia said with her back on Debra, fully tending to the injured witch as she lifted her palms in the air, and a pale, soft light fell around them.</p>
<p>“Oh, okay.” Debra grumbled. When she took a step back, her foot accidentally caught on a corpse lying beside her feet, all gray and motionless as if they were part of the ground.</p>
<p>Debra still had her eyes fixed on Amelia’s back, her mind swimming with thoughts.</p>
<p><em>Should I kill her?</em></p>
<p>Her palms were sweating profusely as she contemplated on her next steps. She was breathing hard through her nose while various scenarios played out on her head, dulling her senses into a chaotic mess. She was already at her wits end.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what the necromancer said was true or not; the truth about her identity had already died with him, and there were no other people present to bring the matter out in the open.</p>
<p>But Amelia was there, and she heard all of it.</p>
<p>Unless.. Debra eliminates her.</p>
<p>Once Amelia’s gone, the Chief position would be up for grabs as well. And as the lone survivor of the most brutal massacre to ever take place, the recognition for having captured three witches and killing the necromancer would surely be accorded to her, and such contribution was enough to propel her as the next Chief Saint.</p>
<p>And within a few months time, she would be able to meet the God she spent all her life piously devoting, and she would live a life filled with nothing but greatness from then on.</p>
<p>It was a life Debra had been dreaming of for years, and it all started when she first set foot into the Church when she was just a mere child.</p>
<p>For fifteen years, she worked tirelessly through day and night and used all the means she could think of to climb all the positions available, bringing herself upwards the social ladder without cease, and suffice it to say that she was finally, at long last, nearing her goal.</p>
<p>She was already one step closer, and she would do absolutely anything to bring her dreams into fruition.</p>
<p>Debra’s hand slowly made its way towards the wand attached on her waist. She bit her lower lip and eyed Amelia sharply, observing her like an eagle would its prey.</p>
<p>Amelia was so feeble-looking, and it’s hard to believe that she possessed such strong magic in her hands. She even killed the necromancer all by herself, and with that knowledge in mind, Debra knew that she couldn’t defeat Amelia singlehandedly, especially not when they’re face to face.</p>
<p>This was her only chance.</p>
<p><em>Should I kill her now?</em></p>
