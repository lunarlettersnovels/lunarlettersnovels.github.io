            <p><strong>Chapter 3.2</strong></p>
<p>Just touching the demon was abhorrently repulsive. The only sensation Valen needed to feel while facing the demons was the heaviness of stabbing his sword deep into their viscera.</p>
<p>“Has the wound I treated barely healed?”</p>
<p>There was evidence of someone having treated Valen’s right arm. Those crazy demon bastards must have sucked out his blood.</p>
<p>In contrast, the wound on Argentine’s neck, inflicted by an axe, had disappeared without a trace. Only fresh red marks remained vividly on her dress. It was a monstrous healing ability. No, she is a monster.</p>
<p>With fiery eyes, Valen stared at Argentine’s right neck. Soldiers who gave their all to tear apart the flesh and shatter bones of demons had their morale shattered in the blink of an eye due to the demonic healing power, akin to a curse for humans. The moment they suffered mentally, they were defeated.</p>
<p>“It gives me chills every time I see it.”</p>
<p>“You’re quite injured. The goat suffered from allergies while treating you. The goat is a competent doctor.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want anything from you dirty demon bastards, whether medicine or disease.”</p>
<p>As he spoke disdainfully, Argentine furrowed her brow slightly. Then, she reached out her hand towards Valen’s neck.</p>
<p>When her icy fingertips touched his skin, Valen flinched momentarily. Whether he liked it or not, Argentine silently continued to unbutton his clothes. The shirt of his ceremonial robes, presumably the one he’d worn before at the altar, fell open.</p>
<p>“What, what are you doing? Get off me! Get off me!”</p>
<p>Despite Valen’s protests, Argent simply continued her work. Inexperienced hands grazed Valen’s skin as if she had never undressed someone before.</p>
<p>After fumbling for a while, Argentine finally unbuttoned the shirt completely. Her indifferent eyes, like a wax doll’s, briefly flashed with a slight sparkle. She had felt a small sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Valen felt a rising sense of ominous foreboding. He had a keen intuition, and indeed, his instincts had saved allies from crises several times before.</p>
<p>This woman was a high-ranking demon, a succubus. In situations like this, a succubus’s actions against enemies boiled down to one outcome.</p>
<p>As his judgment solidified, Valen’s resistance noticeably intensified.</p>
<p>“Try laying a finger on my body. I’ll drag you to an ever-burning volcano and repeatedly dunk you in molten lava!”</p>
<p>“As it happens, there’s a volcano of perpetual fire in my backyard. If we bring a mithril bathtub, it turns into a bubbling hot spring. It’s a very comfortable retreat. However, going alone with a human body could easily lead to being engulfed by magic, so I must accompany you.”</p>
<p>“Damn it, why won’t it come off!”</p>
<p>Valen’s arm muscles bulged as if they might burst as he pulled on the green tendrils. The curves of his muscles were visible through his white shirt. However, the tentacles only grew stronger and more resilient, wrapping around Valen tightly.</p>
<p>“You’re wound is going to burst.”</p>
<p>“Shut up and let go!”</p>
<p>“Dragging it out won’t do you any good.”</p>
<p>Argentine mumbled something incomprehensible and suddenly lowered her head.</p>
<p>“Mmm…!”</p>
<p>His thick ni.pple, protruding on top of dense chest muscles, slipped between Argentine’s full lips. Valen felt a flash before his eyes as if struck by lightning. Her hair, which he had mistaken for a spring breeze, cascaded over his body, enveloping him in a completely different sensation. As Argentine awkwardly licked with her lips, saliva clung to his ni.pple.</p>
<p>“Hmph! No, stop… Get away. Ah!”</p>
<p>As her watery tongue flicked over his erect ni.pple, Valen’s ears turned red as fire. Curses and pants erupted from his mouth. A sharp sensation overwhelmed him as Argentine enveloped his ni.pple with her lips and sucked hard. With his head thrown back enough for his neck to arch, Valen groaned.</p>
<p>“Ah…! Da.mn… haah… haah…”</p>
<p>Finally, Argentine released the nipple. She straightened up and stared at Valen with dry eyes. His mocked nipple trembled with sex.ual tension. His breathing was ragged, his chest rising and falling, and his eyes were red around the edges.</p>
