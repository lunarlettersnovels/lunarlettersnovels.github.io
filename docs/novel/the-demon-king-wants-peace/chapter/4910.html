            <p><strong>Chapter 7.2</strong></p>
<p>“You. I told you to stay out of it. Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Your neck. Well… it looks like it’s going to bruise.”</p>
<p>Argen sat on the edge of the bed, touching her neck. The area where Valen’s hand had been was reddened.</p>
<p>Nadol, looking distressed, examined Argen’s body here and there, and Argen, as if accustomed to it, did not stop him.</p>
<p>“It would have been better if you had been stabbed by a sword. Flesh wounds heal quickly, but bruises linger like they do on humans.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to worry about it. But what’s that on your face?”</p>
<p>“Oh, this.”</p>
<p>Something furry was hanging from Nadol’s long snout.</p>
<p>“It’s a fur turtle. They say it’s good for human allergies…”</p>
<p>“You have to grind it up and drink it for it to be effective, but he feels sorry for it and walks around looking foolish like that. Hahaha!”</p>
<p>Zephyr leaped over the pile of rubble in a single bound.</p>
<p>“Goats are too sentimental.”</p>
<p>Argen tickled the fur turtle’s shell with her index finger. The hidden head and limbs popped out, and its fox-like pointed ears perked up before it retreated back into its shell.</p>
<p>“No, it’s all for efficiency. If I drink it, it just turns into waste. Using it this way, I can utilize it multiple times… Look! Even now, there’s a human in front of me, and I’m perfectly fine…”</p>
<p>As Nadol turned his head, a hand with immense strength grabbed his face. There was a cracking sound as his skull was crushed. Valen slammed Nadol straight to the ground.</p>
<p>If he wanted to escape, now was the time.</p>
<p>The door, which wouldn’t open no matter what he did with physical force, had collapsed. After observing for a month, he realized that the combat abilities of the demons watching him weren’t very high. Perhaps it was because he was just a plaything for a mere succubus. Valen let out a bitter laugh.</p>
<p>Valen pulled the staff from Nadol’s waist and aimed precisely at Zephyr’s right eye. However, the sharp end of the staff stopped just before it touched the eyeball.</p>
<p>“…Ugh.”</p>
<p>His limbs were frozen as if turned to stone, unable to move an inch. It was a sensation he had experienced once before.</p>
<p>“Wow, that could have really hurt. Thank you, Lord Argen!”</p>
<p>Argen, that succubus again…!</p>
<p>Valen strained his entire body to break free from the invisible restraint. His muscles bulged as if they were about to burst, and his veins stood out frighteningly.</p>
<p>“Wow, this monster! His arm is moving?!”</p>
<p>“Who… Who are you calling a monster, you disgusting demon…”</p>
<p>“He… He’s talking?!”</p>
<p>Zephyr’s mouth hung open in shock. He was genuinely surprised, but to Valen, it only seemed like mockery. It felt as if he were a stupid dog being applauded for lying down.</p>
<p>He could feel the light footsteps approaching.</p>
<p><em>Is this where I die?</em></p>
<p>It would be better to dispose of a se3x toy that couldn’t be trained. Considering what Valen had done so far, it would be strange to keep him alive.</p>
<p>“Do not be afraid.”</p>
<p>However, contrary to his expectations, those words, which were worse than death, turned Valen’s stomach.</p>
<p>Argen stopped in front of Valen. Her much smaller frame made her lift her head to look up at his chest.</p>
<p>“I will not harm you.”</p>
<p>Red eyes.</p>
<p>The eyes he had been trained countless times to strike upon sight. And red lips.</p>
<p>‘Come inside me.’</p>
<p>D@mn it. A sudden memory flashed through his mind and then scattered.</p>
<p>Argen lightly covered Valen’s hand with her own. Thud. Nadol’s staff fell helplessly to the floor.</p>
<p>“Neither the goat, Zephyr, nor Finn will harm you.”</p>
<p>Their gazes clashed in the air.</p>
<p>“I have been indifferent. I will explain everything so that you can understand.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Then perhaps your heart will be more at ease than it is now.”</p>
<p>Argen lowered Valen’s hand. And then—</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>An immense impact struck the back of Valen’s head. His vision spun momentarily, and the force was enough to make his large body topple forward. Argen quickly stepped aside.</p>
<p>Thud. Valen collapsed to the floor. As his vision darkened, he thought:</p>
<p><em>You said you wouldn’t hurt me. Treacherous demons.</em></p>
