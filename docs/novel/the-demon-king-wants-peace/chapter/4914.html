            <p><strong>Chapter 5.2</strong></p>
<p>‘Don’t get excited. Don’t give in to this filthy, vile demon. Kill her. Tear off her head and present it to the king as a trophy, burn her limbs to ashes.</p>
<p>‘The only emotions you should feel towards a demon are murderous rage and hatred. Nothing else…’</p>
<p>“Hngh!”</p>
<p>His eyes shot open suddenly. Argen had aligned his throbbing erection with her entrance and lowered herself onto it.</p>
<p>Squelch. Her impossibly soft inner walls, slick with wetness, wrapped around his sensitive tip, sucking him in. The clinging heat squeezed his shaft so tightly it hurt, but the pain was electrifying, almost driving him mad.<br>
Valen’s thighs trembled uncontrollably with arousal.</p>
<p>“Get off… Ugh, no. Stop… Ah!”</p>
<p>With every breathless thrust, Argen’s movements intensified Valen’s trembling. His chin lifted, the veins standing out from his neck to his jaw. The brutal pleasure seemed to shake his very brain.</p>
<p>“No, damn it… Ugh…”</p>
<p>Valen thrashed beneath her. He couldn’t believe he was getting aroused by this disgusting demon. The tendrils squeezing his limbs tightened, and his vision blurred with frustrated tears.</p>
<p>“Hah… Why do you keep… getting bigger? Consider my position, won’t you?”</p>
<p>“Shut the fu!ck… Ngh, who said I… Ah!”</p>
<p>“At this rate, we’ll still be here next year…”</p>
<p>Argen bit her lower lip and made a decision. She pushed down hard, sinking completely.</p>
<p>“Ngh.”</p>
<p>“No… Ah, no…”</p>
<p>Argen braced her right hand against Valen’s abdomen, her palm slipping forward, slick with sweat—whether hers or his, she couldn’t tell. Her fingers turned white as they gripped, and the walls of her opening twitched in response, stretched to their limit.</p>
<p>Valen wasn’t in a good state either. The way she clamped down on him, like she was trying to cut him off, sent a dizzying rush of sensation through him. His eyes rolled back for a moment from the intense penetration. A strangled groan escaped his throat as he felt a crushing mix of humiliation and defeat.</p>
<p>“I heard… you’re supposed to put it all in…”</p>
<p>Beads of sweat formed on Argen’s chin. With trembling hands, she touched what was left of his length. There was still half of it to go. This wasn’t going to be easy.</p>
<p>“There’s no more room… hah… left inside.”</p>
<p>Valen’s eyes darkened with lust, but he hadn’t completely succumbed. He was holding on, just barely, to the pride of being the only hero of the human realm, his unyielding resolve keeping him grounded.</p>
<p>“Stop… please…”</p>
<p>Argen looked down at Valen, her breath ragged. Then she furrowed her brow and sank down completely. As his c0ck buried itself deeper into her, Valen’s face twisted with overwhelming pleasure.</p>
<p>Beneath Argen’s skin, Valen’s rough pubic hair scratched against her. The hem of her dress covered their joined lower bodies entirely. They could only feel each other, knowing they were pressed together as far as they could go.</p>
<p>“Hah, hah… It’s all in.”</p>
<p>Argen panted heavily. Valen desperately wished that this was nothing more than a terrible nightmare. But even as he shook his head, his throbbing flesh still trapped in that tight, wet hole, the reality of the situation didn’t change. The overwhelming pleasure was consuming him, burning through his entire body.<br>
Valen was a hero, but before that, he was a formidable warrior. He had fought countless battles and had always faced death head-on. Though he had known defeat, he had never lost his resolve, even under the most brutal torture. Yet here he was, utterly broken under Argen’s seductive assault.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just defeat—it was utter submission.</p>
<p>An immense, crushing sense of helplessness washed over him, a feeling he had never experienced before.</p>
<p>“N-no… I… I can’t…”</p>
<p>This was a different kind of terror.</p>
<p>“Just… kill me instead!”</p>
<p>“Hold on… It’s a bit… overwhelming.”</p>
<p>“Hah, ngh…”</p>
<p>As Argen began to move her hips slowly back and forth, Valen’s senses reacted with an intensity that felt almost grotesque. His cock, veins and tendons bulging, swelled to its absolute limit, pressing hard against her inner walls.</p>
<p>With each of her movements, a wet sound echoed from where they were tightly joined. Valen felt his dignity being shattered, and he let out a hopeless sob, overwhelmed by despair.</p>
