            <p><strong>Chapter 7.1</strong></p>
<p>A month had passed since he was assaulted by the succubus.</p>
<p>Valen could not forgive Argen, who had thoroughly exploited his body and then disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>The feelings of helplessness and humiliation he felt that day still vividly lingered. As time passed, his anger deepened, and his hatred grew.</p>
<p>The memory of that day was eating away at Valen. The hero of the human world, the leader of the allied forces, the captain of the royal knights, and Leto’s brother. Everything he had protected was shattered miserably.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Valen’s eyes blazed with hatred.</p>
<p>Then, he heard a noise. Those filthy demons. His teeth grated. Valen strode forward with long steps and grabbed a chair with one hand.</p>
<p>Click, the door opened, and at the same time, he swung the chair.</p>
<p>“Did you come out to meet me?”</p>
<p>No, he intended to swing it. But when he saw Argen, his arm froze on its own accord. Thud! In the end, he couldn’t swing it and dropped it to the floor.</p>
<p>Argen glanced down at the chair and then looked back up at Valen.</p>
<p>“Did you not like that chair?”</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s just the chair I dislike?”</p>
<p>“Tell me anything. I’ll replace it all for you.”</p>
<p>Valen laughed savagely. Argen, who had brought him down to rock bottom, appeared completely unruffled.</p>
<p>As Valen took a step closer, there was a clinking sound of chains being pulled. He lowered his head and whispered into Argen’s ear.</p>
<p>“Can you replace the memory of being with you? That’s the worst part.”</p>
<p>“Mind manipulation isn’t good. Even a single attempt can make it hard to distinguish between night and day.”</p>
<p>“It would be better not to know night from day. I’d rather have my eyes gouged out than live with the memory of being with a demon like you!”</p>
<p>“It seems you didn’t like it.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t like it? Do you think such a trivial phrase can explain everything?! It was insanely disgusting. Just thinking about it makes me want to vomit, and it’s so horrific that I want to crush my own brain.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do better next time.”</p>
<p>“Da!mn it, stop pretending to be so composed and sophisticated!”</p>
<p>“…I’ll try to fix it.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I’ll try to fix it.”</p>
<p>Argen walked past Valen and entered the bedroom. There was an indoor training room, a large bathroom, and even a study. It was a place assigned with some care, but Valen was unlikely to notice that consideration.</p>
<p>“You look worse since I last saw you. Are you eating properly? Or rather, are you eating at all?”</p>
<p>“What’s your purpose in keeping me tied up?”</p>
<p>Argen’s brow furrowed. She looked around, then noticed something and made a gesture in the air.</p>
<p>Click. The chains that had been wrapped around Valen’s ankles were broken.</p>
<p>“I didn’t put them on to torment you. I was afraid because you would throw punches without reason…”</p>
<p>“Without reason?”</p>
<p>Valen roughly pinned Argen down. Thud. Argen was trapped between the bed and Valen, frowning slightly. A large hand gripped Argen’s forearm tightly.</p>
<p>“Think again. Remember what you did.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I couldn’t come after the first night. I won’t make excuses.”</p>
<p>“Who cares about that…!”</p>
<p>His large hand moved up from the forearm to press against Argen’s white neck. Valen thought that what he held in his hand was excessively slender and insignificant. It felt like he could snap it effortlessly, like a twig on the roadside.</p>
<p>As he felt Argen’s frailty, his anger shifted direction. It turned inward, towards himself, who had been thoroughly humiliated by such a pitiful demon. A torrent of self-loathing surged like molten lava, burning his chest.</p>
<p>“Lord Argen!!”</p>
<p>Boom! With a tremendous roar, the ground shook. The intact wall crumbled down, and thick, white smoke billowed up. The moment Valen turned his head—</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Something incredibly fast aimed for Valen’s abdomen. The attack was so swift it was almost invisible, but just before it struck his abdomen, Valen caught the foot with both hands. As the surprised assailant let out a short gasp, his body was slammed into the ceiling.</p>
<p>Thud. Small stones fell onto Argen and Valen’s heads. Nadol, who had appeared out of nowhere, took off his cloak and spread it over Argen’s head like an umbrella.</p>
