            <p><strong>Chapter 4.2</strong></p>
<p>“… It’s a shame.”</p>
<p>Argentine now looked downcast after remaining calm despite enduring all kinds of abusive hurls from him. However, her hand stroking his erec.tion did not stop. She moved her fingers without any finesse, yet his lower body continued to swell.</p>
<p>Liquid gathered at the tip of his reddened gla.ns, then suddenly overflowed. Fu.ck! Valen’s temple throbbed with tension.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“Oh, oh no. She seems gloomy.”</p>
<p>Someone else’s voice interjected from thin air.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it just Argentine here? Valen was shocked. Many demons were watching him being mocked! Shame and anger boiled up to his head.</p>
<p>But the demons hiding in the darkness showed no interest in Valen.</p>
<p>“Lord Argentine. It’s okay! Stay strong!”</p>
<p>“We’re cheering for you. We believe in you!”</p>
<p>“We’ll figure out the name later. Hahaha!”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Focus on the wedding night for now.”</p>
<p>“Don’t get too discouraged!”</p>
<p>Some voices sounded quite familiar as if he had heard them at the wedding ceremony. At least one was definitely that da.mn goat.</p>
<p>“Tell me. Since you have an erec.tion, can I take that to mean you want to penetrate me?”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk nonsense. I’d rather mate with a pig.”</p>
<p>Argent’s eyes widened as he spoke.</p>
<p>“I could transform into a pig…”</p>
<p>“Fu.ck, your mere existence is disgusting!”</p>
<p>Huff. There was an audible intake of breath around him. Then, a flurry of words of encouragement passed to Argentine, who mechanically stroked Valen’s erec.tion with an indifferent face.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a touch meant to arouse him sexually; it was a touch of melancholy, and she was unconsciously fiddling with it.</p>
<p>It’s a fuc.king mess. He was about to be helplessly rap.ed, and there were per.verts watching. Worst of all, he found herself getting aroused by this demon’s touch.</p>
<p>Fuc.king succubus!</p>
<p>“… I can’t transform.”</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>Her passive hand suddenly clenched his length with a strong force. At that moment, his heart felt like it was being torn apart as it beat rapidly. Valen became increasingly anxious, feeling like he was being pushed to the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p>“Let go, I don’t have any energy to give to you. If you retreat now, sh.t… I’ll pretend today’s atrocities never happened…”</p>
<p>“They say the most important thing on the first night is the atmosphere.”</p>
<p>“Haah, uh…”</p>
<p>“I tried my best, but I disappointed you.”</p>
<p>Should I have decorated the place with obscene pictures like the goat said… Argentine murmured, tracing the tip with her fingertips. A sharp pleasure took ahold of him, making the ceiling sway white. Valen almost lost his grip on his sanity.</p>
<p>“No, don’t… Ugh, hand… Put it away…!”</p>
<p>“Since it’s come to this. I wish you could tell me what you like.”</p>
<p>“Huh, ah…”</p>
<p>“I want to accommodate you. Do you like it when I do this?”</p>
<p>“Good… uhk.”</p>
<p>Although the body may be ravaged, the mind must be kept pure. But a desire had sprouted, a desire he’d suppressed with all his reason, and though he knew he had to stamp it out before it took deep root, his self-control began to riot.</p>
<p>As her hand rubbed back and forth over his sensitive shaft, he could hardly control himself anymore.</p>
<p>“Are you naturally moist? My hands are all wet.”</p>
<p>“Kuh, shut up…”</p>
<p>“No wonder it’s much easier to touch you. You seem to be enjoying it, too.”</p>
<p>“Ughk, hit me…”</p>
<p>Though it was an insignificant touch, it filled him with fiery sensations. Valen had to tightly bite his lip to stifle his mo.ans.</p>
<p>“But it’s too big. It won’t fit in my hands.”</p>
<p>“Fu.ck…!”</p>
<p>Regardless of Valen’s will, his pelvis moved upward.</p>
<p>“Lord Argentine! You’re doing great. Number 38 seems to be getting excited!”</p>
<p>Those da.mn bastards…!</p>
<p>“Fuck off… Ugh, just stop!”</p>
<p>Valen shouted, his eyes opening fiercely. Getting excited by a demon? Unbelievable. He thought the reason his chest was rising and falling so quickly was because of fury. It must be so.</p>
<p>“Everyone, go away.”</p>
<p>Argentine commanded without taking her eyes off Valen.</p>
