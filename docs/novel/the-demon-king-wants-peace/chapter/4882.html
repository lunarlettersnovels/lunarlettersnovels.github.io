            <h3>Chapter 31</h3>
<p>Just watching her breathe with her lips, smeared with his own sal!va, made him feel like he could come three times in a row.</p>
<p>Since she liked come, Argen would probably like that too. He’d think about that later. For now, he needed to cool down the heat in his body.</p>
<p>Valen couldn’t leave Argen alone for a second, as if the control mechanisms in his head were completely broken. He pressed his lips against her cheek, nipped at her with his teeth, and then softly licked his way up to her earlobe. Valen, completely @r0us€d, couldn’t control his breathing and panted heavily.</p>
<p>“Ah… mmh!”</p>
<p>“Do you like it? Haah, cry more. I’m trying to give you the c0ck you crave. Why are you pushing me away?”</p>
<p>“Mmh, uhh, it’s strange… It tickles.”</p>
<p>“You should say you like it. This is what you want. Stop acting coy and make some noise.”</p>
<p>He poured hot breath onto her, and then he nibbled her ear hard.After licking her neck, he moved down to her chest.</p>
<p>He sucked her ear into his mouth with a hot breath and even more enthusiasm. He nibbled hard, then licked his way down her neckline to her br1e@sts, leaving a trail of marks.</p>
<p>His lu1st was akin to a voracious appetite, as if he wanted to devour her entire body. He was going to devour every inch of Argen’s delicate flesh.</p>
<p>“Ah eugh, ah…!”</p>
<p>Valen sucked on her white br€@st, filling his mouth with it. His tongue swirled around her erect n!ppl€ and are0-la, that stood out in excitement. He sucked in a breath until his cheeks bulged. embarrassing sound of suction echoed continuously around her n!ppl€.</p>
<p>Argen’s chest heaved. As her head tilted back, tears of @r0usΔL streamed down her face. When Valen bit down on her n!ppl€, her back arched like someone struck by lightning. His arm slipped behind her arched back, pulling her body closer to him.</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah, huh…!“</p>
<p>He sucked the n!ppl€ so hard that painful mo@`ns escaped, and kneaded the flesh. Even as Argen shook her head and grabbed his head, Valen persistently bit and did not let go.</p>
<p>“Please, ugh… Mm!”</p>
<p>Her slender waist twitched and repeatedly arched. Argen, lost in ecstasy, stared blankly at the ceiling before tightly closing her eyes. As tears fell, her mouth opened.</p>
<p>“Haa, euh… good…”</p>
<p>Only after a satisfied word burst from Argen did his lips part from her. The sight of her skin wet and sticky with saliva was obscenely l€wd. Not only that, but it was full of bite marks and sensitive from being greedily sucked. Argen pushed his shoulder with her trembling, unsteady hands.</p>
<p>“It hurts… Calm down, and go a bit slower…”</p>
<p>But nothing seemed to reach Valen’s ears. The eyes of the beast, devoid of reason, held nothing but lu1st. His dark, sunken eyes licked furiously at Argent’s n#ke!d body. Even as he saw the flesh being filled with his own marks, he felt it was not enough.</p>
<p>“Haa, eugh, ah!”</p>
<p>He relentlessly drove her, not pausing for a moment as if he knew no retreat. With every pass of his invading lips, red spots formed on the pale body.</p>
<p>Valen took in not only Argen’s tears but all her bodily fluids with his mouth, swallowing them. If he could, he would have bitten her to the bone and devoured her. Every time the things she spat out passed down his throat, his craving grew more intense, whipping him with a sharp lash.</p>
<p>“Haah, bite…”</p>
<p>Although he hadn’t fully possessed her body yet, there were many places that needed to be felt, and his lower body ached with an unbearable urge. His fully erect m€m8€r, stretched to its limit, throbbed like its own master, unaware of patience.</p>
<p>Valen grimaced in pain and hastily pulled down his pants with impatient hands. When he fumbled, he cursed loudly and ran his hand through his hair.</p>
<p>As he stripped off his clothes as if tearing off a shell, his enormous m€m8€r sprang up. Valen guided her hand to grasp his throbbing shaft. He moved her hand up and down, making her feel every bulging vein, and forcibly made her rub the gl@ns.</p>
<p>Valen quickly suppressed the urge to climax that had edged to the brink. His neck, with veins standing out, moved visibly as he swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“Haah, would you accept it even if your little b@astards were to rush at you?”</p>
<p>“What… What are you suddenly talking about?”</p>
<p>“When those guys held you, you let them. When they lift you, you comply. You don’t even think about resisting. If they strip you and act like me, would you stay still then too?”</p>
<p>“They would never strip and come at me…”</p>
<p>“Answer the question.”</p>
<p>Argen closed her small lips and quietly swallowed. Her face, small as a fist, grew serious as if contemplating something, then she spoke in a soothing tone.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want it, I won’t do it.”</p>
<p>“Good job.”</p>
<p>Valen’s mind was in turmoil. Even he couldn’t understand why such words had suddenly come out of his mouth. Had it been bothering him all along? Why? His head felt like it wasn’t functioning properly due to the heat.</p>
<p>Argen is their superior, and the others are subordinates… That must be it. Even as a demon, he didn’t want to see insubordination happening right in front of him. ‘That must be the reason. Ah, f-c!k. Who cares.’</p>
<p>Valen decided to stop thinking and let himself be swept away by the current ecstasy.</p>
<p>He spread her knees wide apart and positioned himself. The blunt tip, dripping generously with pr€cµm, swayed menacingly. Grasping the pillar of flesh, he rubbed it hard against her narrow entrance.</p>
<p>“Ah, wait… No, it’s too… Ah. No, no, not so fast! Ah, ah!”</p>
<p>Argen’s desperate sobbing only served as an aphrodisiac to Valen. There was nothing that could stop him.</p>
<p>Valen poked at the entrance and then rubbed it in a circular motion, spreading his pr€cµm. Then, when he thr.µst powerfully into her with a forceful movement of his hips, Argen’s chest and chin both jolted upwards.</p>
<p>“Ahh!”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>As he thr.µst into Argen’s lower body, his own body stiffened. The muscles on his back, glistening with sweat, stood out clearly. Valen barely managed to keep his eyes from rolling back as he exerted more force. Thr.µst. He drove himself deeply to the root in one go and pulled her body into a tight embrace.</p>
<p>The urge to climax surged to the top of his head. However, he barely held back, feeling her body tremble in small spasms. Veins bulged on Valen’s forehead, and his entire face flushed.</p>
<p>“Haah, so tight. Ah… feels like my c0ck’s going to get cut off.”</p>
<p>Valen muttered with a dazed expression as he slowly rotated his hips.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, eugh, hic… Ah, eugh!”</p>
<p>Argen’s entire body trembled for a long time at the sensation of her !nn€r w@lls being forcibly stretched. She was momentarily stiff as if impaled by a harpoon. After the heavy pain, a sharp wave of @r0usΔL surged. Every joint of her unusually pale skin turned red.</p>
<p>“Slowly, eugh, uh, ah…”</p>
<p>“Good. Hoo… Ugh, good, good…”</p>
<p>Valen tightly embraced her with one arm, moving only his hips as he drove his co0ck into her, plunging it in with a thud. He slammed down hard, not letting any gap form between his c0ck and her inn€r w@lls. The muscles in his forearm braced beside Argen’s face, bulged dangerously.</p>
<p>Argen squirmed beneath him. Her face and chest, slick with sweat, glistened, and a flush spread across her previously pale cheeks.</p>
<p>“Haah, haah…”</p>
<p>To lose one’s mind must be something like this. Valen realized how much he had wanted to do this, to thr.µst his erect m€m8€r into Argen’s squirming insides, and how much he had craved this burning pleasure.</p>
<p>Thr.µst, thr.µst. His hip movements became rough in an instant. Argent’s cries and whimpers filled his lungs with every breath he took.</p>
<p>The pl.€asur3 engulfed his entire body. Every time Argen tried to escape his grasp, a strong possessive desire flared up in his chest, making him want to confine her even more. He wanted to trap her, not even a single strand of hair can escape.</p>
<p>Valen embraced Argen with his muscular arms, as if to crush her, and thr.µst his hips strongly. As he kissed her, he finally couldn’t hold back and climaxed. His bulging muscles stiffened in an instant, becoming as hard as a rock, and he was consumed by the ecstatic pl.€asur3. Her !nn€r w@lls, wet and slippery, tightly grasped his congested gl@ns without mercy.</p>
<p>“Haa, ah… Haa…”</p>
<p>Valen’s deeply set eyes crumpled. His lips aprted as he took a deep breath all at once. His chest heaved urgently.</p>
