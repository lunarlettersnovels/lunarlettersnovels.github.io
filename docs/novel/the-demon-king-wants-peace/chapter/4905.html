            <p><strong>Chapter 10.1</strong></p>
<p>“Oh, and don’t worry about the child growing up without a father. There will be plenty of uncles to take your place. The child won’t be discriminated against or be lonely.”</p>
<p>A child with demon blood. No matter how much of his own blood was mixed in, it was utterly repulsive. There was no way he would develop any paternal affection. However, if Argen truly became pregnant and this fact became known in the kingdom, the entire human realm would be thrown into chaos.</p>
<p>Valen let out a low chuckle.</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s fu!cking ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Valen brushed his disheveled bangs back from his forehead. His eyes pierced into Argen’s face like a harpoon, filled with disgust, contempt, and a clear intent to kill.</p>
<p>Misfortune always struck Valen harder than he could ever anticipate. His life was one where every step was fraught with poison-tipped thorns. When a human was pushed to the extreme, they often became engulfed in a half-crazed positive mindset.</p>
<p>He would either escape the Demon King’s castle before anything happened…</p>
<p>‘Receive a huge sum of money in exchange for impregnating you.’</p>
<p>It wasn’t a choice that led to death.</p>
<p>“If you ever want to see the child, I’ll make sure you can.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that will be necessary.”</p>
<p>His dangerously calm eyes scanned Argen’s body, lingering on her slender neck, the modest swell of her breasts, and finally resting on her flat stomach.</p>
<p>“Just keep your promise.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a tranquil night under the red starlight. White pear blossom petals fluttered and clung to the window. As a white fingertip gently tapped the cold glass, the petals floated down gracefully.</p>
<p>The surroundings were silent, but everything else was bustling. The two demons fussing behind Argen were particularly so.</p>
<p>“In the end, we couldn’t find out the name of Number 38.”</p>
<p>Nadol sighed as he erased the chalkboard filled with notes. As the multicolored chalk dust scattered in a hazy cloud, he flipped the turtle hanging from his shoulder onto his face.</p>
<p>“Lord Argen, I really think we chose the wrong human. His demeanor is too menacing. He didn’t shed a single tear even after hearing our heartbreaking story… He seems more ruthless than those bastard angels.”</p>
<p>Finn clung to Argen’s arm, shaking it as if throwing a tantrum. Argen, who had been listening quietly, gently shook her head.</p>
<p>“We need to consider his position first. He’s trapped here and can’t return to his homeland… It’s understandable that he would be hostile. But I will try my best.”</p>
<p>“With his temper, it’s clear he won’t reveal his name before the year is out.”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. It may be a bit disappointing, but all I need is to have a child with him.”</p>
<p>“I’ve mentioned this before, but I still don’t think you should be the one to get pregnant, Lord Argen…”</p>
<p>“That discussion is over.”</p>
<p>Argen cut him off firmly. Finn couldn’t argue further and merely pouted with a sullen expression.</p>
<p>“Getting pregnant within the year won’t be easy.”</p>
<p>This time, Nadol added his thoughts. His face was filled with worry. The hand that had been erasing the chalkboard so briskly slowed down, and he let out a long sigh.</p>
<p>The situation was indeed dire.</p>
<p>There was another hidden reason, besides just seeking peace, for why they had forcibly kidnapped a human. It was something they hadn’t told Valen and didn’t need to.</p>
<p>“If we don’t achieve results within the year, the electors will convene the council.”</p>
<p>Nadol massaged his forehead as if he were utterly fed up.</p>
<p>“Those old geezers should just mind their own territories, but they can’t stand not bothering Lord Argen!”</p>
<p>Clang! The door swung open as Zephyr entered, clutching a bottle of liquor. He slammed the bottle down on the table in anger, causing it to shatter with a loud crash. Glass shards flew everywhere with the explosive sound. Finn instinctively shielded Argen’s face with his hand, while Nadol merely glanced over, as if accustomed to such scenes.</p>
<p>“They say I’m defective.”</p>
<p>Argen turned her head to gaze out the window. The dim background reflected her impassive face like a mirror. Her eyes, calm as the night, slowly moved from above her head to the heads of the three elders.</p>
<p>They had horns that she lacked.</p>
