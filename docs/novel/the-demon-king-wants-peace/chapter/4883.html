            <h3>Chapter 30</h3>
<p>Perhaps… what Argen wanted wasn’t just his energy, but Valen, himself.</p>
<p>Thinking this way, all of Argen’s actions made sense. She liked him. She wanted him so intensely that she resorted to kidnapping and taking his body by force.</p>
<p>Ha. The realization made him let out a laugh. As a heavy breath escaped, heat suddenly rushed to his face. Maybe it was because of the strong liquor, his skin felt entirely hot. The blood surged so intensely that it even started pooling in the robust flesh of his lower body.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, how long has it been?</p>
<p>Even as his vision swam, his mind raced to count the days. Yesterday was skipped because of the leg hair incident, and the time before that, she was asleep. It’s already been over a week.</p>
<p>Valen’s face twisted in frustration.</p>
<p>Isn’t this a breach of contract?</p>
<p>The sooner Argen bore his child, the sooner he could be freed from this wretched Demon King’s castle.</p>
<p>Crash. As Valen stood up, he knocked over a beer mug. The surrounding noise was so chaotic that the sound of the falling mug didn’t cause much of a disturbance.</p>
<p>“Heading in already?”</p>
<p>Zephyr stood up to follow, intending to open Valen’s bedroom door for him. However, Valen pushed him forcefully in the chest. Zephyr staggered, barely managing to regain his balance.</p>
<p>“I’m going to your master.”</p>
<p>“Master…? Ah, Lady Argen? But was tonight the night you were supposed to be together?”</p>
<p>Zephyr counted the dates on his fingers, then tilted his head in confusion. Valen coldly stared at Zephyr’s fingers before turning away. It didn’t matter whether it was the night they were supposed to be together or not. Skipping it twice already was enough to disrupt everything.</p>
<p>Valen stormed out of the tavern, breathing heavily. Zephyr watched his retreating figure for a long time before sitting back down at the table.</p>
<p>“Laila, I just thought of something. Is it okay for a human to drink demon liquor by the crate?”</p>
<p>“Because of the demonic energy, they’ll die of heat from drinking it.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Laila and Zephyr’s gazes met in mid-air. The two demons were momentarily speechless, simply staring at each other.</p>
<p>“That b@stard was walking away just fine.”</p>
<p>“…Is he a monster? I’m worried about Lady Argen’s taste in men. Next time she marries, I, Zephyr, must personally intervene.”</p>
<p>“Even if he hasn’t exploded yet, there will be side effects in other ways.”</p>
<p>“Side effects? What kind?”</p>
<p>Laila lowered her gaze subtly. Her eyes traveled down Zephyr’s body and stopped between his legs. Realizing the direction of her gaze, Zephyr scratched the back of his head and asked again.</p>
<p>“Well… like an aphrodisiac?”</p>
<p>Laila shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>“…Will Lady Argen be alright?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Valen, with his head lowered, pounded on the door roughly. Not a single servant was in sight on a night like this. Did they all go to the tavern…?</p>
<p>‘They are careless and lax as always. If an attack were to happen while they’re so defenseless, who would respond? Is there anyone here who is actually alert? These demon bast@ards… they have no sense of urgency at all.’ The more he learned about them, themiserable he felt.</p>
<p>Valen knocked on the door again. It shook dangerously, as if it might break. At that moment, he heard a faint sound from inside. Sure enough, Argen stumbled out, rubbing her eyes as she greeted Valen.</p>
<p>“Is the party over already?”</p>
<p>Argen looked puzzled as to why Valen was standing in front of her bedroom. She seemed to have been just about to fall asleep, as her body carried the cozy scent of blankets.</p>
<p>The moment Valen saw Argen’s drowsy face, all his stray thoughts scattered like smoke. A surge of heat whipped through his body sharply.</p>
<p>“You?”</p>
<p>His gaze, heavy and molten, fixed on Argen. Panting breaths escaped through his slightly parted lips. His mind was in disarray. His throat felt parched with thirst, and his stomach churned with a longing for something. Hot, so hot…</p>
<p>His rational thoughts were tangled into a mess in his mind.</p>
<p>“Are you drunk?”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Argen placed a hand on his cheek. The cool touch against his burning skin didn’t calm the heat. Instead, it evaporated his remaining self-control like flames consuming his reason. The blue flames melted his patience to the core.</p>
<p>“You’re so hot. It must be because of the demonic energy… Hmph, mmph!”</p>
<p>Valen pressed his lips against hers. He roughly wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her close with all his strength.</p>
<p>So hot… The feel of her skin and her cool body temperature were a welcome relief. It seemed like Argen could somehow soothe the heat coursing through his body.</p>
<p>Valen clung to her desperately, sucking on her lips. His body staggered as he held her so tightly it could cut off her breath.</p>
<p>“Haah, haah.”</p>
<p>Argen turned her head, avoiding his lips. The sticky saliva stretched like a spider’s web between their lips before breaking in mid-air. Her pupils wavered with confusion. She breathed heavily, her ears tinged red.</p>
<p>“Wait, tonight isn’t the night we’re supposed to be together. I think you’re mistaken…”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>His deep, husky voice tickled Argen’s reddened ear. Her small shoulders trembled slightly. Valen pressed his lips against her eyelids, as if sealing them with a kiss.</p>
<p>“So, what.”</p>
<p>He lifted her chin and pressed his lips against hers again. As she staggered backward from his forceful advance, her legs tangled, and she fell onto the bed.</p>
<p>Valen pushed her down and climbed on top of her, crossing his arms to swiftly remove his shirt. His large frame, with its thick muscles, exuded an imposing presence, his body heaving with desire.</p>
<p>“Why are you, mmph, in such a hurry…?”</p>
<p>“Haah, haah.”</p>
<p>He lost his composure and desperately pressed his lips against every exposed inch of Argen’s skin. Taking advantage of her mo@ns, he thr.µst his wet tongue into her mouth. Argen had to hurriedly accommodate the sudden intrusion. Only the sounds of their tongues tangling, breathlessly lapping at each other filled the air.</p>
<p>Every now and then, muffled mo@ns of frustration escaped from their joined lips. However, Valen showed no intention of slowing down. He pushed forward with rough intensity.</p>
<p>“Keep making noise, don’t stop.”</p>
<p>“Heu… Wait, uh, ah, uuh…”</p>
<p>Argen’s eyebrows furrowed as she bit her lower lip, feeling the pressure.</p>
<p>Valen didn’t release his lips, and with urgent hands, he stroked the inside of her thighs. The thin fabric of her skirt softly brushed against the back of his hand.</p>
<p>Just before pulling down her un!derw3ar, he noticed that she wasn’t w€t yet. While his c01ck felt like it was about to burst, Argen seemed still bewildered by the situation.</p>
<p>Even so, she didn’t completely push him away. Despite her confusion, she accepted his large, beast-like body clinging to her. Why? He already knew the reason. Argen had special feelings for him.</p>
<p>Valen pulled down her underwear completely. He then tried to remove her chemise but ended up tearing it off in his haste. He lost all control as his reason went up in flames. Valen clumsily and urgently rubbed his bare skin against hers as if it were his first time.</p>
<p>Every touch of her soft skin made heat bloom across his own. Valen spread her legs and pressed his lower body against hers, writhing to increase the contact area. Realizing that words wouldn’t calm him, Argen wrapped her arms around his broad back.</p>
<p>“Hmph, mmph…”</p>
<p>They became a single entity, tangled and moving against each other without pause. Each time their lips parted, hot breaths escaped urgently.</p>
<p>Pleasure shimmered in the corners of her eyes. Tears welled up in her trembling pupils, and her breaths became wet with mo@ns. Valen was about to swallow her whole. Argen pounded against his back, unable to handle the force of his thrusts.</p>
<p>Valen grabbed her hands and pinned them down as he pulled his lips away.</p>
<p>“Haah, haah…!”</p>
<p>She took the opportunity to turn her head to the side and hurriedly gulped in the air she was lacking. Her small body heaved noticeably, and Valen could feel it clearly against his skin.</p>
<p>Every action felt like a stimulus. Was it because she was a succubus? Even her breathing seemed maddeningly provocative.</p>
