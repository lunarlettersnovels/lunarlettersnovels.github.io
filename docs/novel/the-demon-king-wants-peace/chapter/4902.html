            <p><strong>Chapter 11.2</strong></p>
<p>A name.</p>
<p>As expected, she had something else in mind. After not showing her face for a month, she suddenly started visiting him almost every day. A sneer formed on Valen’s lips but quickly vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Argen stood in front of the bedroom, quietly waiting for him to enter. However, Valen didn’t move an inch, keeping one hand in his pocket and simply staring at her. Due to the significant height difference, Argen had to tilt her head back quite a bit to meet his gaze. A moment of silence passed between them.</p>
<p>“Do you not want to go in yet?”</p>
<p>When Argen tilted her head and asked, Valen’s face noticeably turned colder. Though she thought she was being considerate and kind, her words struck Valen as an insult, turning his stomach.</p>
<p>Thud. He extended his long arm to place his hand on the wall behind Argen. Her red eyes glanced at his arm. Unlike other demons, her eyes were exceptionally clear, making her gaze’s movement all too transparent.</p>
<p>“I made a deal. I didn’t become a dog. Watch your attitude.”</p>
<p>“Was my attitude unpleasant?”</p>
<p>“Even just breathing in front of me fills me with murderous intent. You’re already pushing my limits, and now you’re hovering around me. Are you begging to be killed? Trying to mimic some noble sense of superiority is just revolting.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to upset you. I just wanted to do my best for you.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you did your best. K!dn<em>pp!ng, impr!s0n!ng, r</em>p!ng, and now even threatening.”</p>
<p>He had decided to cooperate with Argen’s plan until he found an opportunity to escape, but that didn’t mean he was compliant. More than a month had passed since their first night together, yet just seeing her face still made his insides churn with raw humiliation.</p>
<p>“Act according to your true nature.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“It’s clear what you want from me. You said you’d be free in the evening?”</p>
<p>A strong arm wrapped around Argen’s waist. He didn’t apply much force, but her body wavered and leaned.</p>
<p>Argen instinctively placed both hands on his chest. Valen gripped her slender waist with one hand, as delicate as her neckline. A thin line appeared above her indifferent brow, indicating she felt a slight pain. Valen took in every change in her expression.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop playing house and get on with what needs to be done. It makes things easier for both of us.”</p>
<p>“I want to give you time to accept this.”</p>
<p>“Do I have to give not just my body but my heart as well? Will that make the essence stronger?”</p>
<p>“Essence…”</p>
<p>“Call me or come to me, whichever you prefer.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I’ll do my d@mned best to give you my seed.”</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>Since childhood, Valen had to take responsibility for his sick younger sibling in place of his deceased parents, leaving him with not a single day off in a year. Even before he made a name for himself as a demon hunter, he averaged four hours of sleep a day, and staying awake for three consecutive days was nothing to him.</p>
<p>Because of this lifestyle, he still slept less than most people. He preferred extreme outdoor training over sedentary activities, making his current situation feel very unfamiliar and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>After breakfast with Argen, Valen was left with nothing to do but stay cooped up in his room.</p>
<p>D@mn it. This was nothing short of torture for Valen. A monotonous peace that was almost unbearable.</p>
<p>Under the clear, azure sky without a single cloud, white doves fluttered about, and the massive pear blossom tree he had seen before swayed like a woman’s hair.</p>
<p>Though he had set foot in the demon world countless times, he had never felt such tranquility. Was this place always like this? The unfamiliarity that challenged his prejudices made Valen frown deeply.</p>
<p>Uncomfortable. He would have preferred the blood and screams under the red moon.</p>
<p>Boredom crawled over his skin like insects. Despite trying to ignore it, the constant wriggling made him rotate his arms and crack his neck. He tried every indoor exercise he could think of, from push-ups to jumping in place and hanging exercises, but the fundamental problem remained unsolved. Moreover, it was frustrating that his stamina couldn’t be depleted with just bodyweight exercises.</p>
