            <p><strong>Chapter 10.2</strong></p>
<p>The throne of the Demon King was inherited, and it was the role of the electors to certify this. However, after the death of Argen’s parents, the previous rulers, the electors turned their backs on her. There were several attempts to change the dynasty, but they lacked sufficient justification to proceed.</p>
<p>Just as a bird without wings was not a bird, and grass without fragrance was not a flower, Argen lacked the horns that every demon should possess. The electors, who had maintained their positions for nearly a thousand years, valued legitimacy highly and were extremely displeased with the idea of a hornless Argen sitting on the throne.</p>
<p>Thus, they used the continuous war with humans to question her qualifications as a ruler and attempt to change the dynasty.</p>
<p>“Who do those senile old men think they’re calling defective?! They should worry about their own rotten brains!”</p>
<p>Finn shouted furiously, and Zephyr nodded vigorously in agreement.</p>
<p>“Since we’re in a bad mood, let’s have a drink!”</p>
<p>“You broke everything, and now you want a drink? Go get a rag and clean up. Stop smashing bottles like a brute. You almost injured Lord Argen!”</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Lord Argen, don’t be too lenient with Zephyr. He’ll really think it’s okay because his brain is made of muscle.”</p>
<p>“I’m really fine.”</p>
<p>“Please be kind only to me. Okay? Okay?”</p>
<p>Nadol grabbed Finn by the scruff of his neck and threw him backward. With a loud crash, Finn was slammed into the wall, and dust settled over him.</p>
<p>However, without showing any sign of pain, Finn got up and shouted irritably, “Nadol!” Nadol’s face twisted in exasperation.</p>
<p>“When are you going to stop acting like a spoiled child, even though you’re an elder?”</p>
<p>“For life! Even after death! Lord Argen said she’s fine!”</p>
<p>“She’s already got a lot on her mind, so stop acting like a child.”</p>
<p>“Who are you to tell me what to do?”</p>
<p>“You’ve been acting even more immature since he arrived. Lord Argen can only tolerate so much.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a rag. Nadol, can I use your turtle?”</p>
<p>The argument quickly escalated. Nadol and Finn were fiercely exchanging words, spitting in their fervor without any sign of backing down. Meanwhile, Zephyr was preoccupied with finding a rag. He tore down a curtain and rubbed it, but when it didn’t absorb, he even resorted to ripping his own clothes.</p>
<p>In this chaotic situation, Argen remained quiet. Her lips were tightly sealed, but her mind was a cacophony of worries. The elders’ bickering seemed almost mild in comparison.</p>
<p>The people living in tension due to the ever-looming threat of human invasion, the demons of the Demon King’s castle growing weary from hard labor, the electors, and Number 38.</p>
<p>Is it because I lack horns? The weight of the crown feels especially heavy. So much so that my head feels like it might buckle and break.</p>
<p>Argen habitually rubbed her head with her fingertips before moving. As she gracefully passed between the elders, Finn asked, “Lord Argen, where are you going?”</p>
<p>“To make an effort.”</p>
<p>“What kind of effort…?”</p>
<p>“Whatever it takes.”</p>
<p>Argen walked alone down the empty corridor after leaving the room. She shouldn’t have left him unattended for a month. No matter how busy she was with state affairs, she should have checked on what he was doing. To neglect him at a time when his help was needed the most was a mistake.</p>
<p>Therefore, Argen decided to give him as much attention and effort as she could from now on.</p>
<p>“I hope it’s not too late.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What kind of nonsense is this?</p>
<p>It was just after the blue hue of dawn had faded. Valen stared coldly at the table laden with food, enough to make the table legs buckle, but he did not pick up his spoon.</p>
<p>Ever since he had heard the demons’ talk about a marriage alliance or whatever nonsense, this kind of feast had been laid out for a week straight. Not just three meals a day, but snacks in between as well. He wasn’t a school kid needing snacks.</p>
<p>Despite the abundance, or rather excess, of food, Valen had no appetite at all. Instead, he began to suspect it might be a new form of torture.</p>
