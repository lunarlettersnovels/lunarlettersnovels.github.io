            <p><strong>Chapter 15</strong></p>
<p>From being a mercenary to a demon hunter and now bestowed with the title of Knight Commander, Valen had witnessed the vile depths of human nature through countless wars since his childhood. He had walked a path soaked in the concentrated blood of all manner of desires.</p>
<p>S3xu@l desire, in particular, not only incited strong impulses on its own but was also intertwined with the lu.st for killing and conquest. Conscripts dragged to the battlefield engaged in relations with each other or with livestock to quell their seething anxiety and fear.</p>
<p>Even so, these instances were relatively tame. Most often, they acted as marauders, violating humans. It was never a clandestine act. Whether the sun was up or not didn’t matter, nor did the location or hygiene. They engaged in forced, debased c0pul@t!on in the middle of streets where piles of corpses burned brightly.</p>
<p>It was an act of one human conquering another—brutal and humiliating. It was as vile as chewing and swallowing raw meat dripping with blood.</p>
<p>Valen had witnessed such acts countless times, wiping his blood-stained sword in the midst of 0rg!es filled with groans.</p>
<p>When he was promoted to commander and gained authority, he prohibited his soldiers from committing r@pe. This applied not only within the unit but also in the enemy territories that had fallen as spoils of war.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because of moral values, ethics, or respect for human dignity that he banned such atrocities.</p>
<p>It was simply because he found it aesthetically repulsive and filthy.</p>
<p>The battlefield was a place where one must keep their senses sharply attuned and make rational decisions at every moment.</p>
<p>Even if a comrade who laughed and talked with you last night was writhing with their limbs blown apart, you must not be shaken. Even when death glinted sharply from all directions, aiming for your neck, you must suppress your fear. It was a place where you must constantly overcome physical limits and numerous crises.</p>
<p>For this reason, Valen confined himself under strict rational control. Laziness was something that would never cross paths with his life, and the desire to seek one-dimensional pleasures never tempted him.</p>
<p>To Valen, r@pe seemed utterly vile and repugnant. The idea of having subordinates who, blinded by lu.st and the des!re for conquest, painted like beasts was something he could never accept.</p>
<p>However, his soldiers thought differently.</p>
<p>In the extraterritorial battlefield, r@pe was a much-needed diversion for the weary soldiers, an act so devoid of guilt that it was flaunted like a heroic tale.</p>
<p>‘D@mn it… With so many women around, does it make sense to jerk off by hand?’</p>
<p>‘Look at this guy’s eyes. He’s planning to pull something off behind the commander’s back today. It’s actually for the best. Better to become a mythical creature than to die disgracefully on the battlefield.’</p>
<p>‘Yeah. My thing is indeed as robust and solid as a mythical creature.’</p>
<p>‘That thing between your legs? It’s just a stinking, boiling pile of filth. Didn’t you see the guy last week who got caught ra.ping a female prisoner? The commander chopped off his d!ck and stuck it on his forehead. Dying as a unicorn, now that’s a proper mythical death.’</p>
<p>‘Fu.ck! He’s got portraits painted with a smile on his face, so why is he acting like a di!ck on the battlefield?’</p>
<p>‘I can’t even look the commander in the eye when he’s in front of me…’</p>
<p>However, the subordinates only voiced their complaints among themselves when Valen was not around; they had no will to resist. In a place that valued hierarchy more than any other, one must lie down where it was seen fit.</p>
<p>Especially Valen, who was a strict superior within the unit, never considered individual circumstances.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Valen spent the night alone in a bedroom reeking of s*men. The act of rav@g!ng Argen like a madman was gradually turning into regret.</p>
<p>To think he had committed an act he so despised, of his own volition. It was unbelievable. S3xu@l des!re intoxicated by the lu.st for conquest. An uncontrollable urge that seemed to possess him.</p>
<p>If it had been a meticulously planned act, he wouldn’t have felt such self-loathing. What about yesterday? Originally, he had intended to simply stimulate himself with his hand, ejaculate as quickly as possible, and leave the room. But all his plans had gone awry.</p>
<p>Leaving aside his ill feelings towards Argen, it was hard to believe that he couldn’t control his own desires.</p>
<p>“If only I could leave this place.”</p>
<p>Valen could hear soft, rhythmic breathing from behind him. Without magic, he couldn’t even open a window. Valen had been trapped in this bedroom the entire time. He wanted to clean up the s*men that kept flowing from between Argen’s legs, but the door to the bathroom was firmly shut.</p>
<p>There was nothing Valen could do here. All he could do was writhe in self-loathing.</p>
<p>“When is she going to wake up?”</p>
<p>It seemed like more than ten hours had passed. The sun had been up for quite some time, yet Argen’s eyelids hadn’t moved. She didn’t even have any sleep habits, maintaining one position and sleeping deeply. Are demons originally such a sleepy species? If it weren’t for her breathing, he might have suspected she was dead.</p>
<p>Argen needed to wake up for him to leave this d@mn bedroom.</p>
<p>Should I wake her?</p>
<p>As soon as the thought crossed his mind, he shook Argen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Wake up.”</p>
<p>There was no response. Is she dead while still breathing?</p>
<p>How was it in the knight order he belonged to? At the sound of his footsteps, the soldiers would hurriedly tidy up their bedding from dawn. Valen himself was also a light sleeper.</p>
<p>It was the first time he encountered someone who didn’t wake up even when called so openly. A slight sense of bewilderment arose.</p>
<p>Valen let out a frustrated sigh and called Argen a few more times. However, she wasn’t someone who would wake up from a casual shake.</p>
<p>If it had been a knight from his order sleeping, he would have kicked them awake. No, was it even reasonable to be more cautious with this demon than with his direct subordinates? Valen shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts.</p>
<p>In the end, he couldn’t bring himself to kick her. Instead, he snapped his fingers right next to her ear.</p>
<p>The loud sound struck her eardrum directly, causing Argen’s eyelashes to finally flutter.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>Finally, her drowsy eyes focused on Valen’s face. How long had it been since their eyes last met? Valen felt a strange sense of relief. At last, he could leave this place.</p>
<p>Argen’s smooth forehead and small nose looked as soft as freshly steamed potatoes. She wore a languid expression, as if she had been completely sated.</p>
<p>“…Who?”</p>
<p>“If you’re awake, open the door quickly.”</p>
<p>“Door, door…”</p>
<p>Even though Argen had opened her eyes, she couldn’t fully regain her senses and kept repeating the same word stupidly. The only fortunate thing was that she didn’t fall back asleep despite her dazed state.</p>
<p>As she sat up, her bare ch3st was fully exposed. The dark bruises and swollen n!ppl3s, left by his brutal sucking and biting, looked like the marks of abuse.</p>
<p>He had ravaged her like a madman.</p>
<p>Valen felt a shiver run down his spine, despite being the perpetrator. Argen, on the other hand, seemed completely unfazed. She got out of bed, still half-asleep, without even realizing her exposed state.</p>
<p>In the end, Valen grabbed her arm and pulled her clothes up. Argen looked up at him with unfocused eyes.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at? Open the door.”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, you’ve been stuck in this place the whole time?”</p>
<p>“Thanks to whom have I been quietly trapped here?”</p>
<p>“I had no intention of confining you. You are free to roam anywhere in the Demon King’s castle.”</p>
<p>Argen continued, rubbing her eyes. She wasn’t a fast talker to begin with, but in the morning, her speech was excessively languid. Valen found her soft, almost ticklish voice as irritating as sunlight.</p>
<p>“Is making empty promises a hobby of yours? You said you needed my s*men, but I knew you were bluffing when you started crying and begging me to stop.”</p>
<p>It was as if a light bulb suddenly turned on above her previously languid face. Her unfocused eyes quickly regained clarity. Argen closed her mouth and fell into a brief moment of contemplation.</p>
<p>“…I was just taken aback because it was different from what I knew.”</p>
<p>She was unusually agitated. Last night’s encounter must have been quite shocking for her. When did she tie people up and r*pe them, and now she pretends to be innocent? Valen, with one hand on his hip, waited for her to continue speaking.</p>
<p>Argen habitually fiddled with her earlobe, where Valen’s bite mark was still vividly visible. She seemed completely unaware of the state her body was in.</p>
