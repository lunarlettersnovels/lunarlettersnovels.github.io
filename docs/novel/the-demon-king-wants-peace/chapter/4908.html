            <p><strong>Chapter 8.2</strong></p>
<p>Nadol rummaged through his belongings and then confidently held something out in front of Valen.</p>
<p>“Here, look. This is the proof!”</p>
<p>[Let’s be friends ♥</p>
<p>– The Demon Realm]</p>
<p>Valen’s expression turned icy. It was a sentence that looked like it belonged in the corner of a lower-grade textbook. He felt pathetic for even momentarily trying to recall his memories seriously over such a half-hearted lie.</p>
<p>“The goat even read through books on friendly human expressions to write this letter.”</p>
<p>“As expected, only Lord Argen appreciates my efforts.”</p>
<p>Nadol dabbed under his eyes with a handkerchief before throwing himself into Argen’s arms. Valen felt his patience wearing thin. How much longer would he have to endure this farce?</p>
<p>“Enough with the small talk. Isn’t there something else you need to explain?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Right. Next, we have the abnormal behaviors of demons due to prolonged overtime and a list of vacation spots they would love to visit if given time off… Judging by your expression, it’s best to skip that.”</p>
<p>“It must have taken a long time to prepare. I’ll listen to it separately later.”</p>
<p>“As expected, Lord Argen is so considerate…”</p>
<p>“How much longer do I have to wait?”</p>
<p>Nadol cleared his throat awkwardly.</p>
<p>“We demons have been searching for a way to end this war. And we have finally found it.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“A marriage alliance.”</p>
<p>Valen couldn’t believe his ears. Among the fervent explanations and additional notes the demons were making, not a single thing made sense to him.</p>
<p>Demons proposing a marriage alliance with humans for the sake of peace?</p>
<p>Valen’s parents had died because of their invasions. Even now, the bodies of innocent humans were being carted out from all over the country. It wasn’t even laughable.</p>
<p>Fine, let’s say for argument’s sake that they were tired of the war. But a marriage alliance? Even a wandering strategist from the outskirts could come up with a better plan than this.</p>
<p>A marriage alliance only holds power if it involves the highest echelons of influence from each nation.</p>
<p>Yet, the demons didn’t even know Valen’s name, referring to him as “No. 38”. Moreover, even though Argen was a high-ranking demon, she was a succubus, not of royal blood.</p>
<p>In other words, even if Valen and Argen held a grand wedding, it would have no impact on the conflict whatsoever.</p>
<p>“So, do you understand our unfortunate situation now?”</p>
<p>At this, Valen couldn’t hold back his laughter. Expecting sympathy from a human? The audacity was beyond belief.</p>
<p>“Lord Argen! That bastard is laughing at us!”</p>
<p>“It might be a unique way humans express comfort.”</p>
<p>“No! Look at his eyes. He’s treating us like complete idiots!”</p>
<p>“To a crooked eye, everything looks crooked. Finn, it’s unfortunate that you lost a tooth, but set aside your ill feelings.”</p>
<p>“Ugh! I’m telling you, it’s not that. Did you see that? He just called me a tiny rat. Did you see his lips mouthing the insult?!”</p>
<p>Finn pounded his chest and raged furiously. Despite his vehement protests, Argen did not sympathize with his words.</p>
<p>As Argen completely ignored his grievances and sided with Valen, a fiery jealousy surged within Finn. He grabbed Valen by the collar as he sat still.</p>
<p>“Be honest. You have no intention of cooperating with us. Lord Argen’s patience is not limitless!”</p>
<p>“Who said that? I never said I wouldn’t cooperate.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>The murderous glint in Finn’s eyes subsided. His face was overtaken by a deep sense of bewilderment at the unexpected response.</p>
<p>“Move your face away. It stinks.”</p>
<p>“You little…!”</p>
<p>As Finn was about to lunge, Nadol grabbed him by the scruff of his neck. Finn was dragged away without even throwing a punch.</p>
<p>“Do you truly intend to cooperate?”</p>
<p>Argen set down her teacup. Despite having sipped from it quite a bit, it seemed to have only decreased by a single sip.</p>
<p>The surface of the tea rippled, reflecting Argen’s impassive face. Was she trained to hide her emotions? There was no sign of delight, nor any urgency to persuade him.</p>
<p>Even when she had forcibly taken Valen, she maintained that same expression. The only difference now was a slight furrowing of her brows.</p>
