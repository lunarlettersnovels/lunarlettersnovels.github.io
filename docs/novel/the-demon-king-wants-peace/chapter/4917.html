            <p><strong>Chapter 4.1</strong></p>
<p>“You’re warm.”</p>
<p>Argentine’s finger traced from Valen’s nape down through his spine, between his chest, all the way to his navel in one smooth motion. Valen twisted his waist at the chilling sensation akin to a blade.</p>
<p>“Haah, get your filthy hands off my neck before I twist it.”</p>
<p>“Is your body naturally this hot?”</p>
<p>Despite being an ordinary touch, his body responded excessively. He felt intense embarrassment at succumbing to the allure of a high-ranking succ.ubus. Refusing to yield to the heat simmering from below, he gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll succumb to your cheap seduction twice?”</p>
<p>For the first time, Argentine displayed a different emotion. Her narrow, pale brow furrowed.</p>
<p>“I have never seduced you.”</p>
<p>“Such lies won’t work on me. I’ve dealt with demons all my life. Among them, but you are the most disgusting, repulsive thing I’ve ever seen, succubus.”</p>
<p>Even as Valen spoke with venom, Argentine blinked absentmindedly. Then she tilted her head with a wry smile.</p>
<p>“Succubi… Are you talking about me?”</p>
<p>“I’ve had succubi in heat crawl into my mansion and bedroom every day, yet I’ve never lost control to them.”</p>
<p>“Succubus, ah… It may be unpleasant for humans. But without energy, they cannot survive…”</p>
<p>“Don’t get too excited and get out of here right now. You’ve chosen the wrong opponent.”</p>
<p>Despite his fierce tone, it didn’t affect Argentine. She absentmindedly turned her slender arm. The warmth that had barely subsided crept up again as her hand explored up his thigh.</p>
<p>“No, stop…!”</p>
<p>“They say honest conversation is important at first. But if our conversation drags on, it will only ruin the mood.”</p>
<p>“Get your hands off!”</p>
<p>As her small and gentle hand approached his inner thigh, his muscles tensed with a strange tension. Despite feeling like ice beneath the fabric, her touch felt like a lava-like sensation that strangled Valen.</p>
<p>His muscles stiffened with an odd tension as the small, soft hand moved closer to his inner thigh and the warm, heated flesh of her groin as she clutched Valen. Despite the coolness of her body through the fabric, her touch felt like a lava-like sensation that strangled Valen.</p>
<p>“Kuh, ah…”</p>
<p>Despite Valen’s mood being driven to the ground by humiliation, the flesh between his legs thickened regardless. Even though he wanted to tear apart the demon right away, his lower body was hardening with desire.</p>
<p>To be tempted with this…!</p>
<p>He didn’t want to believe his lower body’s reaction. This succubus wasn’t the only one lus.ting after Valen’s body. Everyone wanted him, from his former employers when he was a mercenary to royalty from other countries to women who already had families.</p>
<p>Valen had been tempted many times in his life, but he never relented. He hadn’t even batted an eye when naked women rushed at him.</p>
<p>But now he was shaking uncontrollably.</p>
<p>At that moment, without hesitation, Argentine opened Valen’s pants and exposed his erect co.ck. Valen let out a deep breath, and Argentine was startled. She hadn’t expected the muscular flesh, as thick as her forearm, to tremble so threateningly.</p>
<p>“…Hmm, it’s thick and robust. I can’t say it’s pretty, but… I’m okay with it.”</p>
<p>Her voice was far from okay.</p>
<p>“Haah, stop criticizing… Fu.ck. Get off me, now…”</p>
<p>“You were supposed to say something nice at first. Was it that bad?”</p>
<p>“Since earlier, what king of bullsh.it are you babbling… Ugh!”</p>
<p>Her white hand touched his dense pubi.c hair. Valen felt a sense of crisis and tried to struggle roughly, but he forgot to resist her touch as it wrapped around his shaft, and his waist lifted involuntarily.</p>
<p>“Kuk…!”</p>
<p>The abs under Argentine’s butto.cks were shaking. Her body also rose slightly before sinking back down. Her small hand could not even fully wrap around his entire peni.s. It lazily swept up his length, causing the foreskin to rise along with it—and gave him a surge of pleasure. Valen was horrified by the unwanted sensations he felt.</p>
<p>He tried to resist somehow, looking at Argentine.</p>
<p>“You’re angry, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Even if I die, uh… I will definitely tear your throat apart.”</p>
<p>“I am Argentine. Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Do you think I’ll tell my name to a filthy demon like you?”</p>
