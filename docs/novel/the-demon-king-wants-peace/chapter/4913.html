            <p><strong>Chapter 6.1</strong></p>
<p>“Stop… Ah, ah…”</p>
<p>“I can feel every twitch of your c0ck.”</p>
<p>“Hah… No… Stop, please… Ah…!”</p>
<p>Everything was unbearably hot. The tight, suffocating walls, Argen’s voice, her breath, even the air he was inhaling—it all felt like a massive flame coiling within him.</p>
<p>“I wish you’d hurry up and cu!m.”</p>
<p>“Gah… Just kill me instead!”</p>
<p>“Would this help you finish?”</p>
<p>Argen lifted her hips slowly, and the sensation of her tightening around him made Valen gasp for breath. As she raised herself halfway off his length, she suddenly dropped back down with a wet slap.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>A wave of ecstatic pleasure crashed through him. Argen’s once fluid, rippling movements began to quicken, and the rough friction sent shockwaves through his body. Her breathy m0ans splashed against his wet chest, while the sweat pooling in the hollow of his collarbone slid down to his abs.</p>
<p>“Hah… Ah! Ah…”</p>
<p>Argen didn’t stop moving, her body continuing its relentless rhythm. The sticky connection between them broke and reformed with every thrust. As her pace increased, so did the intensity of the sensations, pulling him deeper into a pit of pleasure.</p>
<p>With each withdrawal of his cock from her tight walls, fluids—whose they were, he couldn’t tell—spilled down his shaft, sticking to his pubic hair and harshly rubbing against Argen’s skin.</p>
<p>Argen placed her hands on his shoulders, leaning forward as her silver hair cascaded over his damp body.</p>
<p>“Please… Ah, ah…!”</p>
<p>She panted heavily, her breath coming out in rapid gasps. Valen no longer knew what he was begging for. The longer this went on, the more an indescribable thirst welled up within him, his eyes clouded with violent urges.</p>
<p>“Hah… Ah…”</p>
<p>Argen slammed down on him repeatedly, but then paused. She took a deep breath, rolling her hips in a circular motion while keeping his cock buried inside her to the hilt.</p>
<p>Valen’s fingers twitched unconsciously. He wasn’t sure what he was trying to grab onto. His mind was turning into a jumbled mess. No… This can’t be happening…</p>
<p>“Gah!!”</p>
<p>Without warning, Argen started moving violently. A wave of nausea, as if he had been doused in filth, surged up inside him, only to be overwhelmed by an even stronger burst of pleasure. He tried to resist, but the slick sensations had already taken root in every corner of his mind.</p>
<p>“Please, ah, ah! Stop… I hate this, I hate it…!”</p>
<p>No matter how much he thrashed or screamed, he couldn’t escape. The obscene sounds of flesh slapping against flesh filled his ears. Blood vessels burst in his eyes, and the bandages wrapped around his arms began to stain with blood.</p>
<p>“Shh… Just a little more…”</p>
<p>“I’m losing my mind… Hngh, ah… Ah!”</p>
<p>“Don’t hold back. Let it out.”</p>
<p>“No… I don’t want to…!”</p>
<p>“Come inside me.”</p>
<p>Her soft voice slipped into his gasping mouth, and the tight string holding him together snapped.</p>
<p>“Ah…!”</p>
<p>A bolt of blinding ecstasy struck Valen down. His sweat-slicked body tensed, releasing the devastating pleasure he had been holding back.</p>
<p>“Ugh… Ngh…”</p>
<p>His vision blurred as his hips lifted off the bed. His throbbing, swollen cock plunged deep into Argen, and despite her startled shudder, he spilled his hot release inside her. Valen’s wide-open eyes were a chaotic mix of despair and bliss, tears welling up on his retinas.</p>
<p>As the mind-numbing orgasm slowly ebbed away, his hips dropped back to the bed. His soaked, miserable consciousness began to reawaken.</p>
<p>But Valen hadn’t finished cumming yet. The pent-up load he had held back poured into Argen, filling her completely.</p>
<p>“There’s so much… Ugh, it’s going to overflow.”</p>
<p>A tear that had gathered at the corner of Valen’s eye finally fell, trailing down his temple and dripping onto his ear.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Dividing the world in a binary manner is something only humans do.</p>
<p>Is it because of their narrow perspective? No. It’s because it makes things easier to manage. It allowed them to solidify their own position, and for the sake of internal unity, a common enemy was necessary.</p>
<p>From the human perspective, demons are absolute evil.</p>
<p>There’s no room for reconsideration—they are enemies to be exterminated.</p>
