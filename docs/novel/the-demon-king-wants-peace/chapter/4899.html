            <p><strong>Chapter 14</strong></p>
<p>“Ah… it’s too big, go a little slower. That’s… that’s enough…”</p>
<p>Argen lifted her hips, her slip tangled around her waist, and one of her butt0cks, which had been slapped several times, was red and swollen.</p>
<p>“Ease up a bit… if you tear it, who do you think will be more sorry?”</p>
<p>“You, of course, you’ll become a eunuch… Ah!!”</p>
<p>He plunged his c*ck, which had not been fully inserted, all the way to the root in one swift motion. As the inner walls contracted like a vise, Valen was on the verge of 3j@cul@t!on. He let out a long breath due to the overwhelming sensation, feeling like his eyes were about to roll back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Argen, who had been writhing on her stomach, stopped moving. Through her parted hair, her reddened neck was clearly visible. Her skin was so pale that even a slight blush stood out in stark contrast.</p>
<p>“Do you have time to rest? You seem quite relaxed.”</p>
<p>He pulled his lower body back slightly and then thrust it in with a loud smack. As Argen let out a short, heavy mo@n, her inner walls twitched as if in sp@sm.</p>
<p>D@mn, this is driving me crazy. Sweat trickled down from Valen’s temples.</p>
<p>The pleasure, numbing his senses, blurred his vision like a fog. As Valen instinctively rotated his hips slowly, Argen urgently reached back with her hand. Her small fingertips touched his abs. His eyes, darkened with arousal, looked down at her trembling hand with pity.</p>
<p>“I gave you what you like. What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m going to throw up… I’d appreciate it if you could pull out just a little.”</p>
<p>“Who says they’re going to throw up? I’m just as disgusted.”</p>
<p>Misunderstanding Argen’s words, Valen moved his hips roughly. He supported himself with both hands on the bed and pressed his lower body tightly against hers. His coarse pub!c hair rubbed painfully against her soft bu.tt0cks.</p>
<p>Valen used only the strength of his hips to mercilessly thrust into her. With each deep thrust, the sound of flesh slapping against flesh echoed, and Argen’s breaths were laced with mo@ns.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah! Ah…! Sl-slowly… Please, calm down a bit, hng! Hngh!”</p>
<p>Valen leaned down and bit her earlobe. The sensation of his teeth sinking into her skin ignited a fire of desire. Sadistic s*xu@l tendencies, depraved lu!st. No, this was revenge. The fierce anger of one who had been violated.</p>
<p>“You’re disgusted, and yet you won’t let go of my c*ck?”</p>
<p>“No, hng… it’s not disgusting. Ah!”</p>
<p>“You said you felt like throwing up. Ha, what’s with the nonsense you’re spewing.”</p>
<p>A pleasure that felt like it was burning him up from the inside out spread through his lower body. He was aware he was fu!cking her like a dog, but he couldn’t stop. Why should he stop? It was her who had brought him to this point in the first place.</p>
<p>He bit down on her earlobe and the nape of her neck, which had turned pink, while thrusting his hips upward. Each forceful entry into her inner walls brought a surge of a certain thirst that seemed to obliterate his consciousness, and he felt his self-control slipping away.</p>
<p>He muttered a low curse and bit his lip. As he grabbed the nape of her neck, now slick with sweat, and thrust deeply, Argen’s thighs trembled intermittently. She clutched the pillow so tightly that her fingertips turned white, trying to endure the weight pressing down on her, but she shook helplessly. It seemed that the position, as if she were being devoured by his muscular bulk, was too much for her.</p>
<p>Eventually, Argen grabbed Valen’s arm with difficulty.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, it’s not… disgusting… Ha, ugh. It’s just that… you’re too big…”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Your c*ck… fills me up completely.”</p>
<p>Argen panted heavily, her face buried in the pillow. Her voice was barely audible, and her eyes were wet with tears. The tension in her abdomen was palpable, and something was about to burst forth. The pleasure reached its peak without warning, and it felt like it was going to explode.</p>

<p>A large amount of s3m#n gushed out. Argen’s back arched in surprise.</p>
<p>“Hngh… Ah. Too, much…”</p>
<p>“Ha, ha…”</p>
<p>The sweat droplet from Valen’s chin finally fell onto her cheek. Argen’s bu.tt0cks spasmed pitifully, causing her inner walls to twitch. Thanks to this, his c*ck remained swollen even after 3j@cul@t!0n. It was all Argen’s fault.</p>
<p>“That’s enough, now pull out… Uh! Ugh!”</p>
<p>Valen reached down and grasped her breasts. As he pressed down on her sensitive n!ppl3s, the constricting force grew stronger, and her head was thrown back.</p>
<p>“Ha, ah! Let go… Stop, stop, ah!”</p>
<p>Argen struggled violently, her limbs flailing about. She tried to pry Valen’s hands off with her sweaty palms, but the peak of her pleasure came first. Argen buried her face in the pillow, her breathing ragged and uneven.</p>
<p>It felt like her inner walls were mercilessly devouring his highly sensitive c*ck. Valen felt like he was going to die from the intense ple@sur3, his brain numb. His eyes rolled back, and his lips parted like a person intoxicated with drugs. While his entire body was drowning in 3cst@sy, his mind was overflowing with all sorts of curses.</p>
<p>Damn s*x demon. You should at least have some mercy when turning people into idiots. Ha, I like it. I like it……</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Valen grabbed her waist and flipped her over. As his m3mb.er remained firmly embedded, Argen’s upper body jerked up as she flipped halfway around.</p>
<p>“Look at your face. You’re loving this, aren’t you? Be honest. The marriage alliance was just an excuse to f*ck me, right?”</p>
<p>“No, hng! It’s not…”</p>
<p>“Not, huh? Yet every hole of yours is dripping wet.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, again? Stop, I can’t take it anymore. Please…”</p>
<p>“Demons have a hard time getting pregnant, right? You should be grateful I’m giving you more s*men. So the marriage alliance was just an excuse, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It’s not an excuse, hng… Ah!”</p>
<p>Argen instinctively closed her legs, and Valen’s eyebrows twitched in dissatisfaction. He pressed his large hand against her thigh, spreading it wider than before. Then, he penetrated at a shallow angle, piercing deeper into her inner walls. Argen let out a short, anguished cry, and with all her might, she clung to his neck.</p>
<p>The sound of flesh slapping against flesh was violent. As Valen drove into Argen strongly, quickly, and without any sign of retreat, she lost consciousness and could only crave cl!max. When she nodded her head, tears fell, and Valen’s clothes became haphazardly wrinkled.</p>
<p>“Ha, I’ll give you as much as you can handle. Try to endure it.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, ugh! Faster. Give me more, more…”</p>
<p>“Heh… Good, great…”</p>
<p>Valen let out a rough groan, his voice trembling, as he tightly embraced her body. At the same time, he thrust his length deep into her, causing Argen’s toes to spread wide like a fan.</p>
<p>Her inner walls were constricted, unable to withstand the pleasure. Without warning, s*men gushed out. Argen’s inner walls were completely filled with Valen’s cu.m.</p>
<p>“Hngh, ah…”</p>
<p>Argen, who had reached her peak, collapsed in exhaustion. There wasn’t a single spot on her body, from her eyes to her fingertips, that wasn’t flushed red.</p>
<p>Valen, experiencing the highest form of ecst@sy a human could feel, panted heavily. He slowly withdrew from her, then thrust back in, causing Argen to wince and furrow her brows.</p>
<p>“Do you… want more?”</p>
<p>“…Of course not.”</p>
<p>“Could you please take it out? It’s a bit uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with it? This?”</p>
<p>Valen intentionally twisted his hips, causing Argen to wince and furrow her brows as if in pain. She nodded her head, looking like she was about to pass out. She was already exhausted from just one round. How could she possibly handle more? Valen clicked his tongue and slowly pulled out.</p>
<p>Finally free, Argen’s droopy eyelids lost control, and she eventually closed them completely.</p>
<p>Even though Valen’s p3n!s was still thr0bb!ng above her navel, she surrendered her body to the overwhelming exhaustion.</p>
