            <h3>Chapter 32</h3>
<p>“Haah, haah, haah…”</p>
<p>Argen, completely soaked with Valen’s essence, looked up at him with eyes still dazed from the afterglow of her climax.</p>
<p>The moment their eyes met, despite having released a large amount, his member hardened again. Without hesitation, Valen thrust it back into her entrance. As he forcefully pushed inside, Argen’s lips parted slightly.</p>
<p>“Ah… Ah!”</p>
<p>Argen mo@`ned as if she was being choked. Valen’s member was unreasonably large for her to take in. It squeezed right in her inner walls and thrusted in and out without mercy. Every time, her vision would blur faintly and then clear up sharply.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah… Please, ugh…good, ah!”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to f!ck you harder? Don’t close your eyes. Look at who’s c!mm!ng inside you.”</p>
<p>“Hnngh, euh… Ah, more, more… Ugh!”</p>
<p>They embraced each other’s n#ke!d bodies as if their lives depended on it. As Argen’s hands slipped down his swaaty back, she grabbed onto the blanket. The overwhelming waves of pleasure caused Argen to reach another orgasm.</p>
<p>The sensation of her walls squeezing tightly around his engorged manh0!od made Valen’s abs clench. It felt insanely good, his chest heaved.</p>
<p>“Hngh, w-wait, you… hngh, still… I’m still coming, ah! Ah!!”</p>
<p>“Good… Huh, ugh, ahh…”</p>
<p>Without pause, Valen thrusted his member inside again, hard. The sound of flesh slapping violently was heard, and her legs were red and swollen.</p>
<p>Valen’s bedside manners had never been gentlemanly before. He pushed Argen to her limits, pouring out all of himself and marking her so she couldn’t even think of anything else for a moment.</p>
<p>However, compared to now, one could tell how much more controlled and rational their earlier lovem@ak!ng had been.</p>
<p>“Please, ah, I-I can’t anymore. L-let’s take a break…”</p>
<p>Argen gasped and let out a long mo@`n, eventually losing consciousness. Even as her head fell limply to the side, Valen could not stop. He fulfilled his unrelenting desires over and over. Beads of sweat dripped from his neck and chest, soaking into Argen’s body.</p>
<p>“Haah, f!ck…”</p>
<p>He released hot liquid inside her, filling all her trembling inner walls. Yet, as tight as her body was, it couldn’t contain everything. The excess spilled out, small streams of it seeping through the edges and bubbling slightly as it escaped.</p>
<p>When he withdrew, it was as though a dam had burst, and the fluids rushed forth in a torrent. Valen wiped the slick juices with his hand before pressing it all back into her. Nothing was to be wasted. Then, he slipped his arms under her limp form, lifting her gently.</p>
<p>He leaned her limp head against his chest and buried his wet m@nj0od inside her already overflowing core. Even though Argen was unconscious, her body still shuddered at the sensation.</p>
<p>“It’s still not enough.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“More, I need to fill you more.”</p>
<p>Valen grabbed her hips tightly and f!ck`ed her fast and hard, his large hands wrapped around her trembling frame as he was consumed by his desire.</p>
<p>“Ah… ngh… ah…”</p>
<p>Valen groaned, completely lost in the sensation of being inside her. Even as sweat dripped from his body and he came deep within her, his thirst remained unquenched. Despite holding her entirely in his grasp, he craved more. He needed more.</p>
<p>Muttering a low curse under his breath, Valen seized Argen’s lips. He devoured her tender, pliant inner walls, his tongue entwining with hers as he greedily drank her saliva, the room filled with the messy, wet sounds of his voracious kiss. It wasn’t merely a kiss—it was an act of pure predation. The sound of their wet, slick bodies colliding and pulling apart echoed through the bedroom.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>Valen had become a beast unleashed from its chains, driven solely by raw, primal impulses as he consumed her completely. The bed was drenched in fluids, and his overwhelming scent clung to Argen from head to toe. Her pale, slim stomach seemed to swell shallowly as it held and held his cu!`m.</p>
<p>“Hngh, Ah… ah…”</p>
<p>Argen, who fainted and woke up several times, was now lying limp in his arms with only her eyes open. Her skin was so thoroughly marked that its original color was almost unrecognizable. Anyone who saw her in this state might have mistaken her for someone who had endured prolonged abuse.</p>
<p>Valen grasped her weakened hips and positioned his length against her core. Sweat was dripping down her spine.</p>
<p>Puck! With a sharp thrust, he withdrew entirely before driving himself back in with enough force to bury himself to the hilt, his pace relentless. Her head lolled backward, and Valen wasted no time, grabbing her chin to bring their lips together again. Even then, his lower body moved with unyielding intensity, his hips driving against her insides in a steady rhythm</p>
<p>“Ngg… Ah, ah…”</p>
<p>Argen’s body trembled helplessly. Her face was swollen, puffed from her constant crying. Then, the creak of a door opening pierced the heavy atmosphere. Valen cursed under his breath, pulling a blanket over Argen’s exposed body.</p>
<p>How many times had it been now? Eight? Nine? Persistent knocking had echoed earlier, but he had ignored it. Now, the uninvited guest had taken matters into their own hands, forcing their way in.</p>
<p>“Damn it. Why the hell didn’t I lock the door?” Valen muttered irritably, running a rough hand through his hair before climbing off the bed. He hastily grabbed a robe hanging nearby and threw it on.</p>
<p>“Get to the point,” he growled.</p>
<p>“Lady Argen… she’s alive, right?”</p>
<p>It was Nadal. The thick scent of bodily fluids wafting from Valen pierced through the musk of the beast pelt and assaulted his nostrils. Nadal’s face twisted uncontrollably in discomfort, betraying his embarrassment.</p>
<p>“Do you think a demon would die from a few rounds of s#x?”</p>
<p>“You do realize you’ve been at it for two straight days, right? It’s revolting… I get that the demonic energy might have heightened your arousal, but by now, it should’ve dissipated. Poor Lady Argen… she hasn’t had a proper meal, and she’s clearly at her limit…”</p>
<p>Valen turned away sharply, as though unwilling to hear another word, but Nadal quickly grabbed his wrist. Before Valen could shake him off, something cold and metallic clicked into place around his wrist.</p>
<p>Valen’s gaze hardened as he stared down at the bracelet now fastened to him.</p>
<p>“What do you think you’re doing?”</p>
<p>“It’s a bracelet imbued with magic. Lady Argen ordered it to be made. She said you might need it. It was completed yesterday, but you showed no signs of stopping that madness… Ugh, whatever. Now that you have it, please take a break. For heaven’s sake, bathe Lady Argen and make sure she eats…”</p>
<p>Valen closed the door as if he didn’t need to hear any more. Before putting on the bracelet, the door wouldn’t budge no matter what he did, but now it moved so easily. So this was the magic of that bracelet. He scoffed bitterly. How insignificant.</p>
<p>Stripping off his robe, Valen approached the bed. His sculpted, muscular frame glistened in the dim light. With a sharp pull, he peeled back the damp blankets to reveal Argen’s battered, sweat-soaked form. Her entire body was in a complete mess.</p>
<p>‘…Did I do this to her?’</p>
<p>Even though he had lost control, this was too much. She endured this much because she was a demon… A long vertical wrinkle formed between her closed eyes. Even in sleep. Her breath came shallow and labored.</p>
<p>What shocked him most was the primal reaction he still felt, his ar01usal refusing to subside even at the sight of her ruined state. Valen took a deep breath and lifted her body into his arms.</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>“What in the world is this… We’ll handle this!”</p>
<p>The servants couldn’t hide their horror. Is that really their Lady Argen wrapped up in the blanket like a corpse? One by one, they reached out their hands in concern, but Valen ignored them all, carrying her directly to the bathroom.</p>
<p>“You need only set her down. We’ll take care of the bathing…” one of them offered hesitantly.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>No way. The hand that closed the door was firm. He might have trusted royal servants, but these ones? Unacceptable.</p>
<p>For one, their gender was a problem. Men—equipped with the same thing as him—bathing her? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And they were demons too. Who knew what kind of grotesque anatomy they might have? Spiked or doubled parts, perhaps even worse. Just thinking about those things standing erect as they washed her made his blood boil.</p>
<p>And then there was the constant chatter. Just like now.</p>
<p>“Our poor Lady Argen…”</p>
<p>“She really picked a brute. Lady Argen is perfect in every way, except her taste in men.”</p>
<p>“Maybe we should tell Lord Nadal to send him away before it’s too late…”</p>
<p>Annoyed, Valen scooped a handful of water from the tub and flung it toward the door. The shrieks and hurried footsteps of retreating servants brought some much-needed silence.</p>
