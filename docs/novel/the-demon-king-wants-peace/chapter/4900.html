            <p><strong>Chapter 13</strong></p>
<p>“Suck on this. Close your lips, and don’t use your teeth.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>Valen’s lips twitched. Look at her. Argen wrapped both hands around his wrist and moved her head back and forth. He had expected her to just suck like a child, but she was doing quite well.</p>
<p>However, her mouth was too short to swallow all of his fingers.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Valen paid no mind and pushed his fingers in until the gap between them touched her lips. Argen’s pupils dilated widely, and heavy coughing and gagging erupted from her. But Valen didn’t relent, pressing against the inside of her mouth.</p>
<p>“How do you plan to swallow my c*ck when you can barely handle my fingers, huh?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, ah, it’s okay…”</p>
<p>“If I push my c*ck all the way into your small mouth, your throat will bend according to its shape. Every time saliva flows in, your throat will constrict, and if I ejaculate deeply, you’ll have no choice but to swallow it all.</p>
<p>If you try to vomit after I pull out, I’ll block your mouth. Swallow it all. Even if I say it firmly, will you still say it’s okay then?”</p>
<p>Curiosity and sadistic excitement surged rapidly.</p>
<p>“Ugh, cough, ugh…”</p>
<p>Argen grimaced as if she were about to die, gripping his arm roughly. Valen blinked at the sensation of her rounded nails digging into his skin.</p>
<p>…What was I thinking?</p>
<p>As Valen withdrew his hand, Argen coughed freely and gasped for breath.</p>
<p>“Spit it out.”</p>
<p>He placed his palm under her chin. When she opened her mouth, saliva dripped thickly onto his palm.</p>
<p>“Y-your hand, cough, there’s a wound on your palm… It must hurt.”</p>
<p>Her hoarse voice dripped out as thickly as the saliva. Valen was shocked to realize that his own flesh had swelled at the sight of Argen’s suffering.</p>
<p>Primal desire. Sadistic s3#xual tendencies.</p>
<p>These were words that had always been far removed from him. Yet, what was this reaction of his body? Had the succubus used her magic in that short time? But if she could arouse him with magic, she wouldn’t need to act so desperately.</p>
<p>Even amidst the confusion, his desire did not subside. Instead, it grew. And the answer Valen found was ‘because it’s Argen.’</p>
<p>This was not the intimacy of a romantic relationship. It was revenge for the humiliation of being assaulted, a part of a coercive transaction. It was only natural that his cruelty would manifest in other ways since he couldn’t cut her with a sword.</p>
<p>So, it’s okay to do whatever I want.</p>
<p>As his thoughts settled, Valen wiped the saliva from his palm and brushed his hair back from his forehead.</p>
<p>“You can’t be struggling already.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“After what you’ve done to me.”</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>“Hngh, ah… Ah!”</p>
<p>He hadn’t intended to go this far.</p>
<p>“Wait, ugh…! How long… ngh, are you just going to… ah, suck… Ah!”</p>
<p>Just before entering the bedroom, or rather, before Argen drew the curtains, he hadn’t thought about putting his tongue on her body. It was purely an impulse. A d@mn impulse. The desire for revenge, to repay what he had received, surged within him, and he roughly pulled her clothes down. Even in the darkness, the white mounds of her br3@sts stood out clearly, clouding his vision.</p>
<p>How l3wd.</p>
<p>In the pupils that stared intently at Valen, there was an emptiness that seemed bottomless, as if nothing could ever fill it. Her expression was indifferent, as if she had never desired anything, born as a being stripped of all wants.</p>
<p>Yet, her skin looked so soft that even priests would be aro0used. Was it because of the stark contrast with her expression? Her face, showing no signs of excitement, was strangely alluring.</p>
<p>Alluring?</p>
<p>A thought that flowed in naturally, like water, tightened Valen’s chest with a chill. Alluring, my foot.</p>
<p>“Just a disgusting demon.”</p>
<p>Valen muttered lowly as he tilted his head. When he pushed her entire br3@st into his mouth, he felt her startled body squirm.</p>
<p>Ha. Not a complete stone after all.</p>
<p>As his lips touched her, his hands moved on their own, and her scent irresistibly filled his nostrils. His large, muscular body pressed against her small, panting frame.</p>
<p>Before he knew it, his hand had lifted her skirt and was exploring between her legs. D@mn, everything I touch is so soft. Do you even exercise? When Valen bared his teeth and bit down hard on her n!ppl3, her legs twitched and tightened.</p>
<p>Valen extended his tongue and crushed the swollen n!ppl3. He moved his eyes upward to capture every detail of Argen’s expression.</p>
<p>He pulled off the und3rw3ar caught on his fingertips as if it were a nuisance and immediately touched her core.</p>
<p>“Hngh…”</p>
<p>Argen’s shoulders trembled slightly, her lips parted, and her lower region was wet. The moment the sl!ck fluid wrapped around his fingers, a great flame seemed to burn through Valen’s veins.</p>
<p>She was feeling pleasure from his caresses. A clear sense of exhilaration filled his eyes.</p>
<p>…What a perverted bastard.</p>
<p>From that moment on, he ravished Argen’s body mindlessly. He didn’t even hear her pleading sounds, begging him to stop.</p>
<p>Slurp. Squelch. Her br3@sts were drenched in saliva, and her lower region was wet and making squelching sounds as he moved in and out.</p>
<p>“It hurts… Ugh, it’s too much, stop…”</p>
<p>“Shut up. Why are you whining when you can take an axe to the neck and be fine?”</p>
<p>Valen thrust four fingers into her v@g!na. Squelch, the feeling of her inner walls being forcibly stretched was clearly transmitted. A sense of conquest, as if he was paving a new path in a narrow, unexplored place, followed. Meanwhile, a satisfied smile spread to his lips, unbeknownst to him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Argen was stiff, holding her breath in ragged gasps.</p>
<p>Her white br3@sts were covered in h!ck3ys, and fluid dripped down from her b*tt0cks, plopping onto the floor.</p>
<p>“Ah, it hurts…”</p>
<p>“Where is it? The n!ppl3?”</p>
<p>Argen’s eyelashes trembled slightly. When she nodded, Valen touched her n!ppl3 with the tip of his tongue again.</p>
<p>“Oh. It’s all swollen. Why did you pretend to be so modest when you clearly enjoy this? You probably wanted your n!ppl3s sucked even on the first day.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather, ugh… I will, hngh… I will do it myself.”</p>
<p>“You must be mistaken. You can’t lay a finger on my body.”</p>
<p>“Hngh…!”</p>
<p>“Feel exactly what I went through.”</p>
<p>With four fingers thrust inside her, he pressed his thumb against her clitoris. As he twisted it, a thin m0an escaped Argen’s lips.</p>
<p>“Not like this… Wait, your hand, ugh, it feels strange. Ah!”</p>
<p>Valen didn’t stop and moved his hand vigorously. Her !nn3r w@lls contracted as if trying to swallow his fingers while releasing fluid, and the l3wd scent wrapped around his er3ct m3mb.er. The swollen, red gl@ns dripped fluid as it throbbed.</p>
<p>Valen’s arm muscles bulged as he roughly rummaged through her lower region. Thud, thud. The sound of his fingers thrusting in and out was menacing, even though he wasn’t actually inserting anything.</p>
<p>His palm, hardened from holding a sword for a long time, was rough and calloused. The cl!tor1s was rubbed violently by his rough, firm fingertips, and the inner walls were stretched to the point of pain, swollen and throbbing.</p>
<p>“Ha… If not this, then what? Want me to shove my c*ck in?”</p>
<p>“Ugh…! That would be better. Let’s do it, with your c*ck, ah!”</p>
<p>“Typical succubus, going crazy for c<em>ck. You can’t even handle your n!ppl3s being bitten, how were you planning to suck my c</em>ck?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, ah… I’ll do it. I’ll do it, so, hngh!!”</p>
<p>It was when he pushed his fingers in to the limit. As soon as they hit deep with a thud, Argen’s mouth opened slightly. Her sobbing completely stopped, and her eyes, which had been shining with a sharp light, became hazy. Her toes stiffened and she grabbed the sheets tightly. It seemed as if a faint pink hue would seep out from where her knuckles bent.</p>
<p>Her legs convulsed pitifully. After some time, her strength gave out and her body went limp. Valen completely withdrew his hand from inside her.</p>
<p>“Did you come?”</p>
<p>Tears welled up at the corners of Argen’s eyes. She lifted her trembling eyelids and looked at Valen with eyes still lingering in the aftermath of cl!m@x.</p>
<p>Valen couldn’t avoid her gaze.</p>
<p>“It felt… quite good.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The feeling of rising and then crashing down… I think I might get addicted to it.”</p>
<p>Her words, mixed with her ragged breathing, were absurd. For a moment, Valen’s mind, which had been captivated by her eyes, snapped back to reality.</p>
<p>With just one sentence from Argen, Valen’s mood plummeted. He had intended to repay her with the same humiliation he had experienced, but instead, it seemed he had only served her pleasure.</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Valen gathered Argen’s wrists above her head and held them tightly.</p>
<p>“You said you wanted to suck my c*ck, right?”</p>
<p>“If that is your wish…”</p>
<p>“I’ll let you, so make sure to suck every wrinkle.”</p>
<p>Not with your mouth, but down below.</p>
