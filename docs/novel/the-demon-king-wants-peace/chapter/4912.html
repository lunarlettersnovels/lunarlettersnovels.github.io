            <p><strong>Chapter 6.2</strong></p>
<p>In the distant past, demons and humans waged numerous wars to secure territory. But once each side had settled into their domains, there were few clashes.</p>
<p>Of course, playful demons occasionally played tricks on humans, but compared to what humans did to the demons, it was harmless.</p>
<p>Humans sent armies into demon territory almost daily. They destroyed villages and pillaged resources.</p>
<p>As a result, the demon realm was in a constant state of emergency, never catching a break.</p>
<p>“What’s the situation in the western territory?”</p>
<p>A sleepy voice drawled lazily. Argen, the 31st Demon King, reclined almost fully on the black throne.</p>
<p>“As of early this morning, all the invaders have been suppressed.”</p>
<p>“What about the damage?”</p>
<p>“We’re still investigating, but so far, no casualties on our side have been reported. A few farmhouses were burned down, though.”</p>
<p>“Make sure to conduct a thorough investigation and ensure the livelihoods of the people aren’t affected.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough for today.”</p>
<p>Argen lazily skimmed through the reports piled up in front of her. She had read through just as many yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that, yet the stack never seemed to diminish.</p>
<p>It was all because of the war.</p>
<p>Argen’s head fell back completely. Even though she hadn’t yet given the order to dismiss, the elders began packing up and standing up on their own.</p>
<p>Soon after, the sound of the door opening and closing was heard.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Argen.”</p>
<p>Argen lifted her head. For some reason, three of the elders hadn’t left yet.</p>
<p>“Yes, Nadol?”</p>
<p>Nadol, a demon with the form of a goat, cleared his throat awkwardly.</p>
<p>“What are you planning to do about Number 38?”</p>
<p>Number 38, right…</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>Argen blinked.</p>
<p>“See! I told you! I knew you’d forgotten!”</p>
<p>Zephyr pounded his chest with a fist and shouted. As he laughed heartily, his red, snakelike hair undulated like flames below his waist.</p>
<p>She had completely forgotten due to the overwhelming workload. Even if he was a hastily chosen groom, they had spent their first night together.</p>
<p>As Argen silently panicked without showing any emotion, Finn sniffled.</p>
<p>“Can’t we just kick that human out…?”</p>
<p>“Geez, what’s with all the whining just because a fang got knocked out! I’ll replace it with something even better! How about a mammoth tusk?”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand anything!”</p>
<p>Finn ran up the steps and stood in front of Argen. He bent over and pulled back his lips to show his teeth. His fangs, essential for a vampire, had been broken off.</p>
<p>“It’s that human’s doing. Without my fangs, I’m just a corpse with a sunlight allergy!”</p>
<p>“Finn, I said I’d get you tusks!”</p>
<p>“Shut up! You tasteless brute!”</p>
<p>Nadol grabbed Finn by the waist and pulled him down the stairs.</p>
<p>“The truth is, that’s not the only damage he’s caused.”</p>
<p>Nadol took out a white handkerchief and wiped his sweat. This was the report:</p>
<p>From the building where Number 38 was held, screams could be heard day and night. Number 38 attacked every demon he saw with his fists, causing widespread property damage. The poor lower-ranking demons who tried to bring him food often ended up with their necks twisted.</p>
<p>“…He even tore up the griffin feather comforter that the caretaker had splurged on. The poor guy was so devastated, he cried his heart out.”</p>
<p>“Argen… I don’t think that guy is human. He’s too strong. He doesn’t seem to have any magic or divine power, but he’s definitely a monster. A monster!”</p>
<p>Finn finally broke down in tears, burying his face in his hands. Argen, flustered, stood up from the throne.</p>
<p>“Your fangs will grow back soon.”</p>
<p>“Wahh, Argen!”</p>
<p>Finn jumped up and hugged Argen. She let him cry into her shoulder.</p>
<p>“We brought him here because of the peace treaty with the humans, but if I’d known this would happen, I would have chosen a human with a milder temperament.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Fortunately, the marriage vows haven’t been completed yet, so maybe we could find another human…”</p>
<p>“I will meet him.”</p>
<p>Finn looked up. His face was a mess, red and swollen with tears and snot.</p>
<p>“It’s too dangerous.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I can take a beating.”</p>
