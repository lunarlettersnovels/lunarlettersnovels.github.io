            <p><strong>Chapter 9.2</strong></p>
<p>Valen felt a sense of déjà vu with this utterly foolish conversation. These were the same people who had swung an axe at his neck just to draw 5cc of blood during the wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>In the kingdom, they used a common continental currency inherited from the ancient empire. Could it be that they didn’t know this?</p>
<p>While Valen was astounded by their stupidity, he also had to fervently consider whether this was some kind of advanced psychological warfare. There were often strategies where one pretended to use an obvious tactic only to launch a surprise attack. However, this was the first time he had encountered such blatant ignorance of basic common sense.</p>
<p>“Fine. I accept.”</p>
<p>For Argen, it was an unusually cheerful response. If Valen’s hands had been free, he might have instinctively rubbed his forehead.</p>
<p>“I can’t carry that much. Just…”</p>
<p>Valen scanned his surroundings. There wasn’t anything suitable for comparison. Then he casually pointed his chin at Argen.</p>
<p>“Fill it with top-quality magic stones equal to your weight.”</p>
<p>“What?! That won’t be enough! Our Lord Argen’s weight is too insignificant!”</p>
<p>Zephyr shouted in disbelief. The difference between the weight of an ogre’s cart and Argen’s weight was simply too vast. Eventually, Zephyr picked up Argen and began to swing her side to side like a child’s cradle.</p>
<p>“See? It’s just this much! This weight isn’t even good for exercise!”</p>
<p>Valen was shocked. No matter how informal their relationship, Argen was still his superior. Valen had always lived under strict hierarchical order, where rank was more absolute than law. He believed that even if they were close friends in childhood, once ranks were established, it was proper to adhere to the corresponding etiquette.</p>
<p>But this scene looked like an uncle playing with his niece. It was an act worthy of immediate execution, yet Argen’s expression remained as indifferent as ever. She seemed not only accustomed to it but even comfortable.</p>
<p>To be unable to utter a single word of reproach despite such behavior—he must be a thoroughly disregarded superior.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the demons lived, Valen found their current actions extremely displeasing.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you put her down?”</p>
<p>Zephyr carefully placed Argen back on the sofa, and Argen brought the teacup to her lips as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“You can’t complain later that the amount is too little.”</p>
<p>Despite Zephyr’s stern warning, Valen kept his gaze fixed on Argen’s profile. Once again, she only wet her lips. Why drink tea if that’s all she’s going to do?</p>
<p>Suddenly, Argen turned her head. When their eyes met in midair, Valen felt his heart skip a beat. He realized belatedly that he had been caught staring. It was surveillance.</p>
<p>“Since we have agreed to pay the amount you desire, I will determine the end date.”</p>
<p>As the discussion turned to the deal, the momentary agitation in his heart settled into a cold resolve.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Valen was willing to hear what they proposed, but Argen’s decision was delayed. A vertical line appeared on her white forehead, as if something was bothering her. What on earth was she doing?</p>
<p>“Do you need more time to think?”</p>
<p>“No. I’ve already made up my mind.”</p>
<p>“Then hurry up and tell me…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Argen leaned towards Valen. The scent of pear blossoms enveloped his face, and her hair brushed against his thigh.</p>
<p>What on earth is she doing now?</p>
<p>Valen furrowed his brow.</p>
<p>Her pale, slender arm reached behind his back. As her fingers traced down his spine, Valen quietly clenched his teeth at the strange sensation.</p>
<p>“Until I become pregnant.”</p>
<p>Her soft voice resonated from beneath his shoulder.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Argen nonchalantly leaned back after dropping a bombshell. Valen didn’t even realize that his hands, which had been tied behind his back, were now free. Argen’s words had such a tremendous impact that they paralyzed his mind.</p>
<p>As he remained frozen in an at-ease stance, Argen placed the rope on his thigh. Only then did Valen realize that his hands were free. But that wasn’t the important part.</p>
<p>“Do you even know what you just said?”</p>
<p>“Your sperm will meet my egg and fertilize…”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I was asking!”</p>
<p>“Are you worried? Our ultimate goal is not a one-time marriage but to have a child between a human and a demon. I have already made up my mind. And our bodies are not as fragile as those of humans.”</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous…”</p>
<p>“As soon as the court physician confirms the pregnancy, you can return to the human realm with the magic stones.”</p>
