            <p><strong>Chapter 5.1</strong></p>
<p>“W-What?!”</p>
<p>“Lord Argen, this is ridiculous. We must stand by and help you…”</p>
<p>“Stand back.”</p>
<p>The firm voice left no room for argument. The demons melted away into the darkness, unable to say another word. Valen sensed the presence that had crowded around his bed disperse.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard humans are very shy. I should have been more considerate.”</p>
<p>“Ngh, ah…!”</p>
<p>“I may be clumsy without assistance, but I’ll try.”</p>
<p>“Please, stop… Ugh!”</p>
<p>Two fingers thrust into his mouth, spreading across his tongue and pressing firmly against the inside of his cheek. They leisurely explored, claiming every part of his mouth.</p>
<p>“Move… mmph, stop.”</p>
<p>His tongue lewdly clashed against the fingers every time he tried to speak. Everything about her was a provocation. No, stop. Even as Valen shook his head violently, the fingers persistently followed inside his mouth.</p>
<p>Saliva dribbled from his parted lips, and his eyes, under his dark brows, glared with intense loathing.</p>
<p>Valen was not one to quietly endure such treatment.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Valen’s sharp fangs sank mercilessly into the soft fingers. Argen winced and groaned briefly. Her blood filled Valen’s mouth, the familiar scent that wafted under his nose, rekindled his fading sanity.</p>
<p>Argen finally withdrew her fingers.</p>
<p>“Your teeth are sharp.”</p>
<p>“Next time, I’ll tear out your throat.”</p>
<p>“Did you dislike it?”</p>
<p>“It was disgusting, like a dog.”</p>
<p>“I’ll prepare some oil next time.”</p>
<p>“Pour it on yourself. I’ll light the fire.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Argen released his member, and the flesh bobbed, lightly slapping against Argen’s bottom.</p>
<p>With the blatant stimulation gone, Valen let out a long breath. Seeing Argen rise above him, he assumed the act was over.</p>
<p>But instead, Argen lifted the hem of her dress up to her waist and spread her legs wide. The space between her hairless thighs was fully exposed before his eyes.</p>
<p>Argen pushed her fingers, slick with saliva and blood, into her entrance.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>She grimaced slightly, a soft groan escaping her lips. Forcing her fingers into her unprepared, dry walls naturally caused her pain.</p>
<p>Is this really her first time siphoning a human’s essence? Or is she pretending?</p>
<p>Despite his frown, Valen felt a different heat rising in his face.</p>
<p>Argen remained still for a while, her fingers pushed about two knuckles deep inside.</p>
<p>“This is a problem.”</p>
<p>Argen murmured as she lifted her bowed head. A round blush bloomed on her cheeks.</p>
<p>“I might not be able to take you in.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>“Ngh, ah… Uh…”</p>
<p>D@!mn it, fu!ck, fu!ck… Unrefined curses swirled around Valen’s tongue. His erect flesh twitched shamelessly, and his hand tightened, veins bulging as if to endure something.</p>
<p>“Still… mm, I got three fingers in.”</p>
<p>Argen was intent on continuing her self-pleasure. To call it self-pleasure was a bit misleading, though. It wasn’t about deriving sexual pleasure—it was merely preparation for the act of intercourse.</p>
<p>A succubus this inexperienced? Maybe this was all an act, a performance to lure Valen in.</p>
<p>But Valen had never thought of himself as someone who was into inexperienced women. The real problem was that Argen’s actions were excessively obscene. A rough wave of pleasure surged within him.</p>
<p>The image of her slender fingers forcing their way into and out of that narrow space was seared into his mind.</p>
<p>“Hah… When I touch it like this, it gets all wet down there.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Look, see? It just keeps… hah… leaking out.”</p>
<p>Argen plunged her fingers deep inside herself and then curled them like a hook as she pulled them out, showing the glistening fluid on her white hand to Valen.</p>
<p>Even though her actions were so clumsy they were almost pathetic, Valen couldn’t bring himself to mock her. The way her usually calm and measured voice now blended with excitement was disturbingly lewd.</p>
<p>Getting aroused by a demon? How humiliating!</p>
<p>A crushing wave of self-loathing swept over him, so strong he wanted to castrate his own throbbing member. Valen squeezed his eyes shut and turned his head away.</p>
<p>But with his sight blocked, his hearing only grew sharper. The slick sounds of friction and her heavy breaths licked at his ears like flames.</p>
<p>“I tend to get quite wet.”</p>
<p>“Please, just…”</p>
<p>“You’re leaking too, so we should be able to get through our first night together without a problem.”</p>
