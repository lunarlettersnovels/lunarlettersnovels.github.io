            <p><strong>Chapter 12</strong></p>
<p>Valen sat in front of the empty table, arms crossed tightly, glaring. His muscles bulged angrily, making his forearms look like they were about to burst.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing here that I like.”</p>
<p>Everything was different from what he had experienced before—the tranquility, the current situation where he couldn’t even open a door without magic. He hadn’t expected any consideration for humans, but actually experiencing it made his irritation surge.</p>
<p>At the same time, he thought about reinforcing the wizard troops. Instead of a unit that only casts support spells from the rear, they needed combat-type wizards who could lead the charge when entering the Demon King’s castle.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t been trapped in the Demon King’s castle, he would never have known this information. Given the situation, it would be better to wander around somewhere rather than waste time in this bedroom all day…</p>
<p>“Maybe I shouldn’t have sent her away.”</p>
<p>He had pushed Argen away because her hypocritical demeanor was irritating… He should have used her as a key. Even if he didn’t want to see her, he should have endured it a bit.</p>
<p>Though he had a quick temper by nature, he had learned to suppress it as responsibilities piled up on his shoulders. But why couldn’t he make rational decisions in front of Argen? Thinking back, their first meeting was a disaster.</p>
<p>“I need to reconsider the rank of a high succubus.”</p>
<p>He had thought they were just creatures who came at night to strip off their clothes, but high-ranking demons like Argen could momentarily shake a person’s mind.</p>
<p>Considering that even someone with his strong mental fortitude was affected, ordinary soldiers would fall even more easily. With just a glance from her, an army of 100,000 could be dismantled.</p>
<p>Knock, knock.</p>
<p>The door opened even though Valen hadn’t responded. A servant he had never seen before bowed his head, but it didn’t feel particularly respectful. When the servant raised his head again, Valen was slightly surprised. He resembled Leto. However, seeing the servant’s eyes twist with a sly expression, he retracted his thought.</p>
<p>Comparing a demon to Leto… I must be losing my mind. And what’s with that expression?</p>
<p>“Lady Argen is looking for you.”</p>
<p><em> </em> *</p>
<p>So she said she’d be free in the evening.</p>
<p>He had heard that there was no sun in the demon world. However, warm sunlight was pouring in through the large open windows along the corridor.</p>
<p>“…I thought the sun couldn’t rise here.”</p>
<p>“It’s been a long time since the demon world got a sun! Of course, it’s not real; it’s artificial, so it might feel a bit different from the sun in the human world. To someone like you, Number 38, it might feel artificial… Well, it is an artificially created environment, so there’s no helping it. In the human world, gods manage day and night, but in the demon world, which is beyond the gods’ blessings, we have to control it ourselves.”</p>
<p>Valen didn’t miss the servant’s offhand comment and caught it immediately. The servant’s lively demeanor, with his index finger pointed straight up as he explained, was quite animated.</p>
<p>“You control the weather?”</p>
<p>“With magic. Until a few thousand years ago, the demon world only had night. Without light, plants couldn’t grow, and all creatures in the demon world were carnivorous. The grotesque appearance of demons recorded in the past was all due to the lack of light.”</p>
<p>Now, there were even vegan demons, and the animals had become quite cute as well.</p>
<p>The servant’s chatter went on endlessly, even drifting into a story about his pet rhinoceros developing stomatitis. However, Valen wasn’t listening.</p>
<p>“If you can control the rising and setting of the sun, can you also manipulate the rain and wind at will?”</p>
<p>“Of course! In two months, there’s going to be a big fireworks festival in a village called Cloven. It’ll get dark early then. Since you’re here in the demon world, you should definitely check it out! I’m going on my first vacation in 20 years in three days. I’m planning to travel far, so I’ll be missing this year’s fireworks festival. Such a shame.”</p>
<p>As the servant’s voice grew louder, Valen’s mind became increasingly numb. His fingertips began to stiffen. The ability to control the weather at will was an incredible power.</p>
<p>From a human perspective, weather was the domain of the gods and a crucial factor in determining the outcome of battles. If one could control the sky, they could easily annihilate an entire army. Yet, in all his battles against demons, the weather had never changed bizarrely.</p>
<p>Why didn’t they use such a great card?</p>
<p>A huge question was about to burst into his mind.</p>
<p>“We’ve arrived.”</p>
<p>The servant knocked lightly on the door, just like he had done before, and then flung it open.</p>
<p>Argen’s back came into view as she gazed out the window. At that moment, an elbow poked Valen’s side.</p>
<p>“You’re causing a ruckus because you want to have s3x, right? The rumors are all over the place.”</p>
<p>“… What?”</p>
<p>“It seems like you had an amazing first night. Enjoy yourself to the fullest!”</p>
<p>Thud. The servant pushed him in, and the door closed immediately.</p>
<p>Who said it was good! Only now did Valen realize the meaning behind the smile the servant had given him. Who do they think they’re treating like a h0rny dog? He was burning with the desire to correct the misunderstanding, but the door was already closed, and Valen had no magic.</p>
<p>“Hoo.”</p>
<p>As he roughly tousled the back of his head, he heard a light sound reverberating through the floor. Argen moved from one end of the large window to the other, drawing the curtains. The bedroom became as dark as night, with not a single ray of light seeping in.</p>
<p>As the surroundings fell silent, Valen lightly rubbed the back of his neck and then lowered his hand. Even though there was no reason to be tense, his body seemed to be sensitively heating up.</p>
<p>“Is this your bedroom? It’s quite modest for a high-ranking demon’s room.”</p>
<p>It was a place furnished only with the necessary furniture, without a single luxury item. If anything, it perfectly matched Valen’s taste. There were no gaudy decorations to tire his eyes, and it was comfortable.</p>
<p>“From now on, we’ll spend the nights here together. I’ll decorate the bedroom as you wish, so if there’s anything you want, let me know.”</p>
<p>“All we need to do is a few thrusts and be done with it. What’s the point of adding romance?”</p>
<p>How unfitting.</p>
<p>Valen scoffed and moved. Now accustomed to the darkness, he walked directly toward Argen with his long strides, without hesitation. He stopped when he was close enough to hear her breathing.</p>
<p>“A few times… It sounds like you’re saying you might finish early. Last time, it took you longer than expected, and it was quite exhausting,” Argen said.</p>
<p>“So now I’m being considered boring.”</p>
<p>He didn’t want to recall the memory of the first assault. He had almost climaxed several times but had held back with superhuman endurance. In the end, he had come.</p>
<p>Wait, how was Argen back then?</p>
<p>Deep wrinkles formed on Valen’s forehead.</p>
<p>“I’ll finish early today.”</p>
<p>A slender, pale hand reached between Valen’s chest, and he was met with a gaze that shone like wet, red eyes.</p>
<p>…This succubus.</p>
<p>An unprecedented heat surged through his body, as if it had been pent up. She was going to toy with him again. Valen gritted his teeth, his jaw clenched with determination. This time, he would take control, and not be assaulted.</p>
<p>He grabbed the wrist on his chest and pulled it strongly. Her body, limp and powerless, was dragged onto the bed, and Valen inserted his lower body between her legs.</p>
<p>Her silver hair spread out like waves. Valen placed his hand beside her face and leaned his upper body forward.</p>
<p>“Finishing quickly seems unlikely.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to get it up just by looking at your face.”</p>
<p>“Will it stand if I suck it?”</p>
<p>Her face showed not a hint of being affected. He had tried to mock her to inflict some sort of wound, but the attack had backfired. What a pathetic thing to do, not even a child would stoop so low. Valen raised one eyebrow.</p>
<p>“If I put it in, your mouth and throat would tear apart.”</p>
<p>Isn’t it too small to be used as a hole? Valen inserted two fingers into her mouth. He stretched the soft flesh inside her cheek this way and that, and then pressed her tongue down to open her jaw.</p>
<p>Even as he roughly rummaged through her mouth, Argen showed no signs of pain, her eyes fixed on Valen without wavering. Saliva slowly dripped from between her open lips.</p>
<p>He had intended to humiliate her, but somehow, his blood was rushing to his gr0!n. The sight of Argen’s body writhing beneath his hands was quite a spectacle. If things continued like this, he might actually finish quickly.</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>Argen spoke, her saliva dripping down her chin. What? Was she saying it was okay if her mouth and throat tore apart? She seemed willing to swallow his thing, her eyes fixed on him with an unblinking gaze. But still, he didn’t feel like putting it in her mouth.</p>
